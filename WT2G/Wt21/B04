<H1>Measuring Temperature with Thermocouples</H1>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
One of the most frequently used temperature transducers is the
<I>thermocouple</I>. Thermocouples are very rugged and inexpensive
and can operate over a wide temperature range. A thermocouple
is created whenever two dissimilar metals touch and the contact
point produces a small open-circuit voltage as a function of temperature.
This thermoelectric voltage is known as the <I>Seebeck voltage
</I>, named after Thomas Seebeck, who discovered it in 1821. The
voltage is nonlinear with respect to temperature. However, for
small changes in temperature, the voltage is approximately linear,
or
<P>
&AElig;V &Aring; S&AElig;T<I> </I>(1)
<P>
where &AElig;V is the change in voltage, S is the Seebeck coefficient,
and &AElig;T is the change in temperature.
<P>
S varies with changes in temperature, however, causing the output
voltages of thermocouples to be nonlinear over their operating
ranges. Several types of thermocouples are available; these thermocouples
are designated by capital letters that indicate their composition
according to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) conventions.
For example, a J-type thermocouple has one iron lead and one constantan
(a copper-nickel alloy) lead.
<P>
You can monitor thermocouples with versatile PC-based data acquisition
systems. Thermocouples have some special signal conditioning requirements,
which this note describes. The Signal Conditioning eXtensions
for Instrumentation (SCXI) system, depicted in Figure 1, is a
signal conditioning front end for plug-in data acquisition (DAQ)
boards. SCXI systems are ideal for amplifying, filtering, and
even isolating the very low voltages that thermocouples generate.

<P>
<B>General Case</B>
<P>
To measure a thermocouple Seebeck voltage, you cannot simply connect
the thermocouple to a voltmeter or other measurement system, because
connecting the thermocouple leads to the measurement system creates
additional thermoelectric circuits.
<P>
Consider the circuit illustrated in Figure 2, in which a J-type
thermocouple is in a candle flame that has a temperature you want
to measure. The two thermocouple wires are connected to the copper
leads of a DAQ board. Notice that the circuit contains three dissimilar
metal junctions&ETH;J1, J2, and J3. J1, the thermocouple junction,
generates a Seebeck voltage proportional to the temperature of
the candle flame. J2 and J3 each have their own Seebeck coefficient
and generate their own thermoelectric voltage proportional to
the temperature at the DAQ terminals. To determine the voltage
contribution from J1, you need to know the temperatures of junctions
J2 and J3 as well as the voltage-to-temperature relationships
for these junctions. You can then subtract the contributions of
the parasitic thermocouples at J2 and J3 from the measured voltage.
<P>
<B>Cold-Junction Compensation</B>
<P>
Thermocouples require some form of temperature reference to compensate
for these unwanted parasitic thermocouples. The term <I>cold junction
</I> comes from the traditional practice of holding this reference
junction at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C in an ice bath. The National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) thermocouple reference tables
are created with this setup, illustrated in Figure 3.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Figure 3. Traditional Temperature Measurement with Reference Junction
Held at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C
<P>
In Figure 3, the measured voltage depends on the difference in
temperatures T1 and Tref; in this case, Tref is 0&#161;&Ecirc;C.
Notice that because the voltmeter lead connections are the same
temperature, or <I>isothermal</I> (this term is described in detail
later in this note), the voltages generated at these two points
are equal and opposing. Therefore, the net voltage error added
by these connections is zero.
<P>
Under these conditions, if the measurement temperature is above
0&#161;&Ecirc;C, a thermocouple has a positive output; if below
0&#161;&Ecirc;C, the output is negative. When the reference junction
and the measurement junction are the same temperature, the net
voltage is zero.
<P>
Although an ice bath reference is accurate, it is not always practical.
A more practical approach is to measure the temperature of the
reference junction with a direct-reading temperature sensor and
subtract the parasitic thermocouple thermoelectric voltage contributions.
This process is called <I>cold-junction compensation</I>. You
can simplify computing cold-junction compensation by taking advantage
of some thermocouple characteristics.
<P>
By using the Thermocouple Law of Intermediate Metals and making
some simple assumptions, you can see that the voltage the DAQ
board measures in Figure&Ecirc;2 depends only on the thermocouple
type, the thermocouple voltage, and the cold-junction temperature.
The measured voltage is in fact independent of the composition
of the measurement leads and the cold junctions, J2 and J3.
<P>
According to the Thermocouple Law of Intermediate Metals, illustrated
in Figure 4, inserting any type of wire into a thermocouple circuit
has no effect on the output as long as both ends of that wire
are the same temperature, or isothermal.<BR>

<P>
Figure 4. Thermocouple Law of Intermediate Metals
<P>
Consider the circuit in Figure 5. This circuit is similar to the
previouly described circuit in Figure 2, but a short length of
constantan wire has been inserted just before junction J3 and
the junctions are assumed to be held at identical temperatures.
Assuming that junctions J3 and J4 are the same temperature, the
Thermocouple Law of Intermediate Metals indicates that the circuit
in Figure 5 is electrically equivalent to the circuit in Figure
2. Consequently, any result taken from the circuit in Figure 5
also applies to the circuit illustrated in Figure 2.
<P>
In Figure 5, junctions J2 and J4 are the same type (copper-constantan);
because both are in the isothermal region, J2 and J4 are also
the same temperature. The junctions occur in opposite directions,
however, so their total contribution to the measured voltage is
zero. Junctions J1 and J3 are both iron-constantan junctions and
also point in opposite directions, but may be different temperatures.
Therefore, junctions J1 and J3 are the only two junctions with
outputs that have any effect on the total voltage measured.
<P>
Using the notation VJ<I>x</I>(T<I>y</I>) to indicate the voltage
generated by the junction J<I>x</I> at temperature T<I>y</I>,
the <BR>

<P>
Figure 5. Inserting an Extra Lead in the Isothermal Regiongeneral
thermocouple problem is reduced to the following equation:
<P>
VMEAS = VJ1(TTC) + VJ3(Tref) (2)
<P>
where VMEAS is the voltage the DAQ board measures, TTC is the
temperature of the thermocouple at J1, and Tref is the temperature
of the reference junction.
<P>
Notice that in equation 2, VJ<I>x</I>(T<I>y</I>) is a voltage
generated at temperature T<I>y</I> with respect to some reference
temperature. As long as both VJ1 and VJ3 are functions of temperature
relative to the same reference temperature, equation 2 is valid.
As stated earlier, for example, NIST thermocouple reference tables
are generated with the reference junction held at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C.
<P>
Because junction J3 is the same type as J1 but in the opposite
direction, VJ3(Tref) = -VJ1(Tref). Because VJ1 is the voltage
that the thermocouple type undergoing testing generates, this
voltage can be renamed VTC. Therefore, formula 2 is rewritten
as follows:
<P>
VMEAS = VTC(TTC) - VTC(Tref) (3)
<P>
Therefore, by measuring VMEAS and Tref, and knowing the voltage-to-temperature
relationship of the thermocouple, you can determine the temperature
of the thermocouple.
<P>
There are two techniques for implementing cold-junction compensation&ETH;hardware
compensation and software compensation. Both techniques require
that the temperature at the reference junction be known or measured
with a direct-reading sensor. A direct-reading sensor has an output
that depends only on the temperature of the measurement point.
Semiconductor sensors or thermistors are the most common devices
used to measure the reference-junction temperature. For example,
several SCXI terminal blocks include temperature sensors that
are located near the screw terminals into which thermocouple leads
are wired.
<P>
<B>Hardware Compensation</B>
<P>
With hardware compensation, a variable voltage source is inserted
into the circuit to cancel the parasitic thermoelectric voltages.
The variable voltage source generates a compensation voltage according
to the ambient temperature, and thus adds the correct voltage
to cancel the unwanted thermoelectric signals. When these parasitic
signals are canceled, the only signal the DAQ system measures
is the voltage from the thermocouple junction. With hardware compensation,
the temperature at the DAQ system terminals is irrelevant because
the parasitic thermocouple voltages have been canceled. The major
disadvantage of hardware compensation is that each thermocouple
type must have a separate compensation circuit that can add the
correct voltage to cancel the unwanted thermoelectric signals
at any common ambient temperature, which makes the circuit fairly
expensive. Also, hardware compensation circuitry adds some error
to the temperature measurement.
<P>
<B>Software Compensation</B>
<P>
Alternatively, you can use software for cold-junction compensation.
After a direct-reading sensor measures the reference-junction
temperature, software can add the appropriate voltage value to
the measured voltage to eliminate the parasitic thermocouple effects.
Recall formula 3, which states that the measured voltage, VMEAS,
is equal to the difference between the thermocouple voltages at
the thermocouple temperature and at the reference-junction temperature.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The National Instruments LabVIEW&#168;, LabWindows&#168;,
and NIDAQ&#168; software packages include routines that perform
the required software compensation steps.
<P>
There are two ways to determine the thermocouple temperature when
given the measured voltage, VMEAS, and the temperature at the
reference junction, Tref. The first method is more accurate, but
the second method requires fewer computational steps.
<P>
<B>Procedure 1&ETH;Direct Voltage Addition Method for Software
Cold-Junction Compensation</B>
<P>
The more accurate software compensation method uses two voltage-to-temperature
conversion steps. From formula 3, you can find the true open-circuit
voltage that the thermocouple would produce with a reference junction
at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C, as shown in the following equation:
<P>
VTC(TTC) = VMEAS + VTC(Tref) (4)
<P>
Therefore, this method requires the following steps:
<P>
1. Measure the reference-junction temperature, Tref.
<P>
2. Convert this temperature into an equivalent <I>voltage</I>for
the thermocouple type undergoing testing, VTC(Tref). You can use
either the NIST reference tables or polynomials that assume a
reference junction at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C.
<P>
3. Add this equivalent voltage to the measured voltage, VMEAS,
to obtain the true open-circuit voltage that the thermocouple
would produce with a reference junction at 0&#161;&Ecirc;C, VTC(TTC).
<P>
4. Convert the resulting voltage into a temperature; this value
is the true thermocouple temperature, TTC.
<P>
This compensation method requires a translation of the junction
temperature into a thermocouple voltage followed by a translation
of a new voltage into a temperature. Each of these translation
steps requires either a polynomial calculation or a look-up table.
It is, however, more accurate than the following method.
<P>
<B>Procedure 2&ETH;Temperature Addition Method for Software Cold-Junction
Compensation</B>
<P>
A second, easier software compensation approach makes use of the
fact that thermocouple output voltages are approximately linear
over small deviations in temperature. Therefore, for small deviations
in temperature, you can use the following equation:
<P>
VTC(T1) - VTC(T2) &Aring; VTC(T1 - T2) (5)
<P>
This assumption is true if T1 is fairly close to T2 because the
thermocouple voltage-versus-temperature curve is approximately
linear for small temperature variations. Assuming that the thermocouple
temperature is relatively close to the reference temperature,
you can rewrite formula 3 as shown in the following equation:
<P>
VMEAS = VTC(TTC - Tref) (6)
<P>
Remember that if you are using standard NIST thermocouple reference
tables or equations, the voltage VTC is a function of temperature
relative to a reference temperature of 0&#161;&Ecirc;C. By assuming
linearity and using equation 6, assume that the voltage-versus-temperature
curves with a reference temperature of 0&#161;&Ecirc;C are identical
to curves with a reference temperature of Tref. Therefore, you
can convert the measured voltage into a temperature using the
NIST reference tables. This temperature is the difference between
temperatures TTC and Tref. This simplified compensation method
is as follows:
<P>
1. Measure the reference-junction temperature, Tref.
<P>
2. Convert the measured voltage, VMEAS, into a temperature using
the voltage-to-temperature relationship of the thermocouple. This
temperature is approximately the difference between the thermocouple
and the cold-junction reference, TTC - Tref.
<P>
3. Add the temperature of the reference junction, Tref, to this
value. This is the thermocouple temperature.
<P>
This method saves a computation step over the first method of
software compensation but is less accurate. A comparison of the
accuracy of these two methods is included in the application examples
later in this note.
<P>
<B>Linearizing the Data</B>
<P>
Thermocouple output voltages are highly nonlinear. The Seebeck
coefficient can vary by a factor of three or more over the operating
temperature range of some thermocouples. For this reason, you
must either approximate the thermocouple voltage-versus-temperature
curve using often complex polynomials, or match the curve against
a look-up table. The polynomials are in the following form:
<P>
T = a0 + a1<I>x</I> + a2<I>x</I>2 + ... + a<I>nxn </I>(7)
<P>
where <I>x</I> is the thermocouple voltage in <I>volts</I>, T
is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and a0 through a<I>n</I>are
coefficients that are specific to each thermocouple type. Table
1 lists the NIST polynomial coefficients for several popular thermocouple
types.

<P>
To speed computation time, a polynomial should be computed in
nested form. Consider the fourth order polynomial:
<P>
T = a0 + a1<I>x</I> + a2<I>x</I>2 + a3<I>x</I>3 + a4<I>x</I>4
(8)
<P>
If this polynomial is evaluated as written, several unnecessary
multiplications will be performed to raise <I>x</I> to the various
powers. If the polynomial is written and evaluated instead as
shown in the following formula, no powers are calculated and computation
executes much faster:
<P>
T = a0 + <I>x</I>(a1 + <I>x</I>(a2 + <I>x</I>(a3 + <I>x</I>a4)))
(9)
<P>
The polynomials in Table 1 are accurate only within the listed
temperature ranges. Also, you must include all terms to obtain
the specified accuracy.
<P>
These NIST polynomials are implemented in functions included with
the National Instruments LabVIEW and LabWindows application software
and NIDAQ driver software.
<P>
To avoid the long computation time required for these high-order
polynomials, you can subdivide the thermocouple operating range
into several smaller ranges. A much lower order polynomial, such
as one of the third or fourth degree, can then approximate each
of the smaller ranges. More examples of polynomials, including
lower order polynomials for subdivided temperature ranges, are
listed in the National Bureau of Standards Monograph 125, <I>Thermocouple
Reference Tables Based on the IPTS68</I>.
<P>
<B>Note: </B>As a precaution, check the units specified for the
voltages. For the formulas in Table&Ecirc;1, the voltages are
in <I>volts</I>. For some other thermocouple tables and linearization
polynomials, the voltages are in <I>millivolts</I> or <I>microvolts
</I>. Using the incorrect unit yields erroneous results.
<P>
<B>Thermocouple Measurements with a DAQ System</B>
<P>
Thermocouples are commonly used to monitor temperature with PCbased
DAQ systems. For example, the National Instruments SCXI product
line is especially well-suited for thermocouple measurements.
<P>
SCXI is a front-end instrumentation system for plug-in DAQ boards.
A shielded, rugged chassis houses signal conditioning modules
that amplify, filter, isolate, and multiplex analog signals from
thermocouples or other transducers. The amplified analog signal
is then cabled to the plug-in DAQ board, which digitizes the analog
signals. Figure 6 shows some of the hardware in the SCXI product
line.<BR>

For some applications, you may be able to simply use a plug-in
DAQ board with termination accessories that are equipped with
temperature sensors for cold-junction compensation. These accessories
include the AMUX-64T multiplexer board and the SC-207X Series
termination panels.
<P>
<B>Thermocouple Measurements with SCXI</B>
<P>
The SCXI product line includes a variety of analog and digital
signal conditioning modules for various types of signals. The
SCXI-1100 and SCXI-1120 modules are well suited for use with thermocouples.
<UL>
<LI>The SCXI-1100 is an amplifier/multiplexer module with 32 differential
input channels. The 32 differential inputs are multiplexed into
an instrumentation amplifier that is programmable for gains from
1 to 2,000.
<LI>The SCXI-1120 is an isolated amplifier/ multiplexer module
with eight isolated inputs. Each of the eight channels includes
a jumper-selectable gain amplifier (gains from 1 to 2,000) and
a lowpass filter (4 Hz or 10 kHz).

<B>Signal Conditioning for Thermocouples</B>
<P>
The following sections describe some measurement system capabilities
that can be important when measuring thermocouples.
<P>
<B>High Amplification</B>
<P>
Because thermocouple output voltage levels are very low, you should
use as large a gain as possible for the best resolution and noise
performance. Amplification, together with the input range of your
analog-to-digital converter (ADC), determines the usable input
range of your system. Therefore, you should carefully select your
amplification so that the thermocouple signal does not exceed
this range at elevated temperatures.
<P>
Table 2 lists the voltage extremes from several popular thermocouple
types; you can use this table as a guide for determining the best
gain and input range settings to use.
<P>
For example, a T-type thermocouple outputs -6.26&Ecirc;mV at -270&#161;
C and 20.87 mV at 400&#161; C. If you are using a T-type thermocouple
over this temperature range with SCXI and an ATMIO16F5 board,
set your SCXI module gain to 200. In this configuration, the effective
input range of the system is &#177;5&Ecirc;V/200&Ecirc;=&Ecirc;&#177;25&Ecirc;mV.
Because the ATMIO16F5 uses a 12bit ADC with 212 binary levels,
the resolution of this system with a total gain of 200 is 10&Ecirc;V/(200&Ecirc;x&Ecirc;4,096)
= 12.2 &#181;V. If you are using the thermocouple over a more
limited temperature range, you can use a higher gain to obtain
higher resolution. Both the SCXI-1100 and SCXI-1120 signal conditioning
modules include amplifiers with gains ranging from 1 to 2,000.
<P>
<B>Low-Noise System</B>
<P>
Low-level thermocouple signals are very susceptible to noise corruption.
Therefore, it is very important that the signal conditioning and
DAQ hardware are well shielded and low noise. For example, the
SCXI chassis and modules are shielded, and the cable connecting
the SCXI system to the plug-in DAQ board uses shielded, twisted-pair
cable for the best possible noise performance.
<P>
You can improve the noise performance of your system by amplifying
the low-level thermocouple voltages near the actual thermocouple.
Thermocouple wire acts like an antenna and picks up unwanted noise
from the environment. Because thermocouple voltages are extremely
small, typical electrical noise levels can seriously corrupt the
measurement.
<P>
SCXI modules, however, amplify the thermocouple voltage near the
thermocouple before the signal is passed over the wiring and into
the noisy computer chassis. The noise that is picked up in the
wiring and in the computer has much less of an effect on the high-level
amplified signal.
<P>
<B>Input Filtering</B>
<P>
To further reduce noise, the SCXI-1120 includes a lowpass resistor-capacitor
(RC) filter for each of the eight input channels. These filters
are jumper-selectable for 4 Hz or 10 kHz. The 4 Hz filter is very
useful for removing the 60 Hz power line noise that is prevalent
in most laboratory and plant settings. The SCXI-1100 module includes
a single jumper-selectable lowpass filter. Because this filter
is applied to the output of the module, after the multiplexer,
the filter is useful only for very low scanning rate applications.
<P>
<B>Broken Thermocouple Detection </B>
<P>
It is useful to be able to detect a break, or open circuit, in
the thermocouple circuit. You can use the characteristics of SCXI
amplifiers to detect broken thermocouples. A differential amplifier
saturates to either full-scale positive or full-scale negative
output if the input leads are open circuit. Therefore, when a
thermocouple is broken, the SCXI amplifier saturates and produces
a full-scale output in either direction. You can check for this
saturation condition with software and take the necessary actions.

<P>
<B>Temperature Sensor for Cold-Junction Compensation</B>
<P>
Shielded terminal blocks connect thermocouples to the SCXI-1100
and SCXI-1120 amplifier modules. The SCXI1300, SCXI-1320, and
SCXI-1321 terminal blocks include a National Semiconductor LM35CAZ
temperature sensor that is positioned to measure the temperature
of the reference junction, the analog input screw terminals. The
LM-35CAZ produces a voltage output of 10 mV/ degrees C with no
external calibration required and works at temperatures between
0 degrees and 70 degrees C. The SCXI-1328 is a high-accuracy terminal
block that uses a high-precision thermistor to measure the temperature
of the reference junction. The SCXI1328 also uses an aluminum
isothermal plate to minimize the temperature gradients across
the screw terminals. With the SCXI1328, you can measure the reference
temperature with 0.5 degrees C accuracy. You can use the SCXI-1328
with the SCXI1120 and SCXI1121 modules.
<P>
The AMUX-64T multiplexer board and SC-207X Series termination
boards also include an onboard LM35CAZ temperature sensor.
<P>
<B>High-Performance Scanning </B>
<P>
Although thermocouples are generally used for low-bandwidth applications,
you may need to use high scanning rates to minimize sampling delays
between channels and for applications involving large numbers
of channels. For example, a 10 Hz scanner monitoring 300 thermocouples
can sample each thermocouple every 30 s. An SCXI system, on the
other hand, can scan input channels at up to 7 &#181;s per channel.
Therefore, an SCXI system can sample each of the 300 thermocouples
every 2.1 ms. Also, higher scanning rates minimize the sampling
delay from channel to channel.
<P>
<B>Differential Measurements</B>
<P>
If you are using any thermocouples that are grounded, a differential
measurement is important. With differential measurements, each
channel uses two signal leads; only the voltage difference between
the leads is measured. The differential amplifier rejects ground-loop
noise and common-mode noise, which therefore do not corrupt the
measurement. With single-ended measurements, on the other hand,
the negative leads of all the input signals are connected to a
common ground. The SCXI-1100 and SCXI-1120 modules use differential
input measurements.
<P>
If you are connecting thermocouples directly to your DAQ board
and are not using SCXI, use the differential input mode of the
board, if possible. You can configure the MIO-16 and Lab-PC+ boards
for differential inputs.
<P>
<B>Thermocouple Examples</B>
<P>
The following section includes some examples to assist you in
making your own thermocouple measurements.
<P>
<B>Example 1-Monitoring 64 Thermocouples with SCXI-1100s</B>
<P>
For this example, assume that you want to use 64 Ktype thermocouples
to measure the temperature of a high-pressure boiler system with
a known maximum temperature of 250 degrees C. Assuming that electrical
isolation is not important for this application, you can use two
SCXI1100 modules to monitor the 64 thermocouples. Figure 7 diagrams
the complete DAQ system.
<P>
The AT-MIO-16F-5 board is used to acquire the readings because
the board has a higher scan rate, self-calibration, and high-performance
direct-memory access (DMA) capabilities. The two SCXI1100 modules
are housed in an SCXI1000 four-slot chassis and connected to the
ATMIO16F5 board with one SCXI-1345 shielded cable assembly. This
SCXI-1345 cable assembly is available in lengths up to 10 m.<BR>

<P>
Figure 7. SCXI System for Monitoring 64 Thermocouples
<P>
An IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible computer controls the temperature
monitoring system. Therefore, application software choices for
controlling the system include LabWindows for DOS or LabVIEW for
Windows. Alternatively, you can use a standard programming language
in DOS or Microsoft Windows, such as C, Pascal, or Visual Basic,
and control the DAQ hardware with the NI-DAQ driver software that
is included with National Instruments plug-in DAQ boards.
<P>
First, connect the 64 thermocouples to two SCXI-1300 terminal
blocks, which include temperature sensors for cold-junction compensation.
Determine whether the thermocouples you are using are ground referenced
or floating. If the thermocouples are true floating sources (not
referenced to a ground), you must provide a ground reference for
the measurement system; otherwise, the amplifier bias currents
charge up stray capacitances, which result in drift and often
saturation. Therefore, attach the negative (-) lead of each thermocouple
to ground as shown in Figure 8. Thermocouple leads are color-coded;
the red lead is usually the negative lead. <BR>

<P>
Figure 8. Grounding the Negative Lead of a Thermocouple
<P>
Alternatively, if all 64 thermocouples are floating, you can set
jumper W1 of the SCXI-1100 module to position 2-3. In this configuration,
jumper W1 creates a DC path to ground through a 100 k-ohm resistor,
but this usually increases noise and settling time.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> For the best results, ground the negative leads of
all of your floating thermocouples, preferably near the thermocouple,
and leave jumper W1 in the factory-default position.
<P>
<B>Warning:</B> If you cannot ground the thermocouples for safety
reasons such as high common-mode voltages, use the SCXI-1120 isolation
amplifier module.
<P>
If your thermocouples are already ground referenced, you do not
need to provide additional ground reference and should leave jumper
W1 of the SCXI-1100 in the factory-default parking position.
<P>
Before taking readings, you must determine the configuration of
the SCXI-1100 modules and ATMIO16F-5 board that yields the maximum
resolution possible. A thermocouple reference table shows that
the output voltage for temperatures less than 250 degrees C never
exceeds 10&Ecirc;mV (recall that the voltage measured is a function
of the reference temperature as well as the temperature being
measured). Therefore, a &#177;5 V input range with a gain of 500
(&#177;10 mV maximum signal) accommodates the maximum expected
signal from the thermocouple. With this gain setting, the resolution
is 10&Ecirc;V/(500 x 4,096) = 4.9 &#181;V, or 0.12 degrees at
250 degrees C.
<P>
Both the ATMIO16F5 board and SCXI1100 module include gain amplifiers,
which you configure via software. Because using the largest gain
possible near the signal source yields the best noise
<P>
performance, configure the SCXI-1100 module for a gain of 500
and the ATMIO16F5 board for a gain of 1. With LabVIEW for Windows,
you can simply indicate the high and low input limits (&#177;10
mV in this example), and the driver software calculates the necessary
gain for both the plug-in board and the SCXI module.
<P>
The following sections detail two software compensation procedures
for this example. The first method is more accurate, but the second
method is faster. Consult your software reference manual to determine
the actual functions you need. For example, LabVIEW, LabWindows,
and NIDAQ implement thermocouple conversion routines that convert
measured voltage values into temperatures for different thermocouple
types and perform cold-junction compensation.
<P>
<B>Procedure 1-Direct Voltage Addition Method of Software Compensation
for Example 1</B>
<P>
1. Read the voltage from the temperature sensors (MTEMP) located
on each SCXI-1300 terminal block. The sensor outputs a voltage
of 10 mV/ degrees C, so the gain on the ATMIO16F5 should be either
1 or 10 (10 for the best resolution). Multiply the voltage by
100 to get the reference-junction temperature in degrees Celsius.
For example, if the reading is 0.25 V, the reference-junction
temperature is 25 degrees C.
<P>
2. Translate the temperature sensor reading into the voltage for
a K-type thermocouple at that temperature using either a look-up
table or an NIST polynomial. Notice that the polynomials required
here are the <I>inverses</I> of those given in Table 1. Using
a look-up table, your reading of 25 degrees C translates to a
K-type thermocouple voltage of 1.000 mV. 
<P>
3. Read the voltages on the thermocouple channels. For the example
given, assume that you get a reading of 2.930 mV on Channel 1.
<P>
4. Add the voltage from step 2 to the voltage measured in step
3. You then have
<P>
1.000 + 2.930 = 3.930 mV
<P>
5. Translate the result into a temperature using either a look-up
table or a polynomial such as one from Table 1. For the reading
from the K-type thermocouple of 3.930 mV, for example, you can
calculate that the temperature is 96.15 degrees C.
<P>
<B>Procedure 2-Temperature Addition Method of Software Compensation
for Example 1</B>
<P>
1. Read the voltage from the temperature sensors (MTEMP) located
on each SCXI-1300 terminal block. This voltage is 10 mV/ degrees
C, so the gain on the ATMIO16F5 should be either 1 or 10 (10 for
the best resolution). Multiply the voltage by 100 to get the reference-junction
temperature in degrees Celsius. For example, if the reading is
0.25 V, the reference junction is 25 degrees C.
<P>
2. Read the voltages on any thermocouple channels. For the example
given, the gain is at 500 for Channel 1.
<P>
3. Translate the reading into a temperature using either a look-up
table or a polynomial such as one from Table 1; you get a reading
of 2.930 mV. By applying formula 3 and the coefficients from Table
1, you can calculate that the temperature is 71.6 degrees C.
<P>
4. Add the cold-junction temperature from step 1 to the temperature
obtained in step 3. The result is the temperature at the measuring
end of the thermocouple. For the example given, the temperature
of the boiler system is 71.6&#161;&Ecirc;+&Ecirc;25&#161;&Ecirc;=&Ecirc;96.6&#161;&Ecirc;C.
In this case, the error introduced by using this faster method
is 0.45 degrees C.
<P>
<B>Comments</B>
<P>
Procedure 1 is more accurate but requires two temperature-to-voltage
conversions. Procedure 2 is faster but introduces an error of
0.45 degrees C. To determine if the error from procedure 2 is
acceptable in your application, you can work through some examples
both ways. Use a thermocouple reference table and consider voltages
and temperatures close to those in your application.
<P>
<B>Example 2-Temperature Control with SCXI-1120s</B>
<P>
Consider another application that uses a Macintosh computer with
SCXI to control the temperature of 16 environmental chambers in
a testing facility. A J-type thermocouple in each chamber monitors
the temperature, which never exceeds 200 degrees C. Each chamber
includes a heater that turns on and off to maintain the temperature
at the desired setpoint.
<P>
Another requirement for this application is that the controlled
systems be electrically isolated from the computer that is monitoring
and controlling the station. This protects the computer and DAQ
hardware from large voltage spikes and prevents ground-loop voltages
that can occur.
<P>
Figure 9 shows the complete system for this application. Because
isolation is required, you should use the SCXI-1120 isolated amplifier
module. This module includes eight isolation amplifier channels,
which can operate with a commonmode voltage of 240 Vrms between
channel and earth or between channels. The 16 thermocouples are
connected to the two SCXI-1120 modules using two SCXI-1320 terminal
blocks. This terminal block includes a temperature sensor for
cold-junction compensation. For more accuracy, you can substitute
the SCXI-1328 terminal block, which includes a high-precision
thermistor and an isothermal aluminum plate to minimize temperature
gradients.<BR>
<BR>
Figure 9. SCXI Temperature Control System
<P>
To control the heaters, you can use the SCXI-1160 single-pole
double-throw (SPDT) relay module. This module includes 16 independent
SPDT latching relays that can switch up to 2 A at 250 VAC or 30
VDC. You can use this module with an SCXI-1324 terminal block
to control the on-off state of the 16 heaters.
<P>
In this example, an NB-MIO-16L-9 multifunction plug-in DAQ board
controls the two SCXI1120 isolation amplifier modules and the
SCXI-1160 relay module. The modules are housed in an SCXI-1000
chassis and cabled to the NB-MIO-16L-9 board with an SCXI-1345
shielded cable assembly.
<P>
You can control the DAQ hardware of this example using LabVIEW
for Macintosh. Alternatively, you can use traditional programming
languages with the NI-DAQ driver software for Macintosh included
with National Instruments plug-in DAQ boards.
<P>
Again, you must first determine the configuration of the SCXI-1120
modules and NBMIO16L9 board that yields the maximum resolution
possible. Because the chamber temperature will never exceed 200
degrees C, configure the jumpers of the SCXI-1120 modules for
a gain of 500. This yields an input range of &#177;10 mV for the
system. Next, configure the NBMIO-16L-9 for an input range of
&#177;5 V and a gain of 1.
<P>
The steps for measuring and compensating the thermocouple readings
are identical to those of example 1.
<P>
<B>Sources of Error</B>
<P>
When making thermocouple measurements, the possible sources of
error are compensation, linearization, measurement, thermocouple
wire, and experimental errors.
<P>
Compensation error can arise from two sources-inaccuracy of the
temperature sensor and temperature differences between the sensor
and the screw terminals. The LM35CAZ sensor on the SCXI1300, SCXI-1320,
and SCXI-1321 terminal blocks has an effective accuracy of 0.9&#161;
C. In addition, temperature gradients between the sensor and the
screw terminals can be as high as 0.5 degrees C, for a total accuracy
of 1.4 degrees C. The SCXI-1328 isothermal terminal block, however,
limits temperature gradients and uses a high-precision thermistor
for a total accuracy of 0.5 degrees C.
<P>
Linearization error occurs because polynomials are approximations
of the true thermocouple output. The linearization error depends
on the degree of the polynomial used. Table 3 lists the linearization
errors for the NIST polynomials.
<P>
Measurement error is the result of inaccuracies in the DAQ board
and signal conditioning modules. These include offset error, gain
error, nonlinearities, and resolution of the ADC. The SCXI-1100
module includes software-controlled calibration circuitry that
nulls out the majority of offset error. You can completely remove
offset error of any module by connecting an external ground, measuring
the offset, and subtracting this offset error from subsequent
readings.
<P>
Both the plug-in board and the SCXI module can also introduce
gain error. For example, a calibrated ATMIO16F5 has a gain error
of less than 0.01%, and the SCXI1100 introduces a typical gain
error of 0.1% at gains higher than 1. If the input range is &#177;5
V and the gain is 500, gain error contributes a maximum of (0.1%
+ 0.01%) x 20 mV, or 22 &#181;V of error. However, you can use
an external calibration source to remove this gain error.
<P>
You must also consider the nonlinearity and resolution of the
plug-in DAQ board. The specified relative accuracy of the ATMIO16F-5,
which includes resolution and nonlinearity, is &#177;1.5 least
significant bits (LSB). With a system gain of 500, this is equivalent
to 1.5(20 mV/4,096) = 7.3 &#181;V. With a Jtype thermocouple,
for example, this is equivalent to 0.15 degrees C at room temperature.
<P>
Thermocouple wire error is caused by inhomogeneities in the thermocouple
manufacturing process. These errors vary widely depending on the
thermocouple type and even the gauge of wire used, but a value
of &#177;2 degrees C is typical.
<P>
Another potential source of error is noise picked up by the thermocouple
leads. Software averaging of the acquired data can remove noise
from your measurements. For the best results, you should average
many readings (about 100 or so) for each desired temperature reading.
<P>
Table 3 lists the expected measurement error and resolution in
degrees Celsius, subject to the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>A calibrated SCXI-1100 module
<LI>A calibrated AT-MIO-16F-5 configured for a gain of 1 and an
input range of &#177;5 V
</UL>

<P>
The errors listed in Table 3 include the measurement error of
a calibrated AT-MIO16F-5 and SCXI-1100, and the cold-junction
sensor error of the SCXI1300 terminal block (0.9 degrees C effective
sensor error and 0.5 degrees C temperature gradient error). The
linearization errors of the NIST polynomials and thermocouple
wire error is neglected because of dependence on several factors
as previously listed.

Thermocouples are inexpensive temperature sensing devices that
are widely used with PCbased DAQ systems. Thermocouple measurement
requires signal conditioning, including cold-junction compensation,
amplification, and linearization. The National Instruments SCXI
signal conditioning system is a low-noise front end for PCbased
DAQ systems when you use thermocouples to measure temperature.

<H1>Is Your Data Inaccurate Because of Instrumentation Amplifier
Settling Time?</H1>

<H1>Scott Kasin</H1>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
You may not be aware that the analog data you acquire may not
accurately reflect the real-world signals you measure. For example,
when you use a plug-in data acquisition (DAQ) board with a 12-bit
resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and scan 16 channels
for input with a sampling rate of 100 kS/s, your acquired data
may not be 12-bit accurate. The data that the DAQ board retrieves
appears error free because no data was lost; however, the data
retrieved may not be within the specified ADC accuracy. This is
the result of instrumentation amplifier settling time, an important
consideration when you use any plug-in DAQ board.
<P>
There are two ways to ensure that your data is accurate:
<UL>
<LI> Select a DAQ board with an instrumentation amplifier that
is guaranteed to settle at all sampling rates and gains.
<LI> Reduce your sampling rates to those that your existing board
can accurately attain.
</UL>

<P>
<B>What Is Settling Time?</B>
<P>
<I>Settling time</I> is the amount of time required for a signal
that is being amplified to reach a certain accuracy and stay within
the specified range of accuracy. To see how settling time affects
a DAQ system, consider the block diagram in Figure 1. This block
diagram shows the major components on a DAQ
<P>
board that are necessary for acquiring analog data into a computer:
<UL>
<LI> A multiplexer (mux)
<LI> An instrumentation amplifier
<LI> A sampling ADC
<LI> A first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer
</UL>

<P>
The real-world signals being measured are first routed from a
particular channel via the multiplexer. The signals then enter
the instrumentation amplifier. The instrumentation amplifier applies
a specified amount of gain to an input signal, which raises the
signal to a higher level and ensures proper A/D conversion. The
amplifier also converts any differential input signals applied
to the DAQ board to a single-ended output so that the ADC can
correctly digitize the data. The ADC then samples and holds the
signal until the signal is digitized and placed into the FIFO
buffer on the board. In the FIFO, the digitized signal is ready
to be transferred from the board to computer memory via the PC
bus for further processing.
<P>
The time needed to amplify the signal to the higher level while
maintaining the accuracy of the ADC&ETH;in other words, the settling
time of the instrumentation amplifier is a major concern when
you use plug-in DAQ boards. The instrumentation amplifier must
settle before the A/D conversion takes place or your data will
be inaccurate. If the amplifier does not settle, the voltage digitized
will be higher or lower than the actual voltage signal you attempted
to acquire.
<P>
Figure 1. Major Components of a Plug-In DAQ Board
<P>
Settling time is the result of many factors in the instrumentation
amplifier. Consider a standard resistance-capacitance (RC) lowpass
filter circuit design. When you apply a voltage step to an RC
circuit, the signal requires a certain amount of time to rise
and settle within a percentage of the voltage you want, as seen
in Figure 2. This percentage of V is the range of accuracy, and
the time it takes for the signal to get within the specified range
is the settling time.
<P>
Figure 2. Settling Time of a Standard RC Circuit
<P>
Figure 3 shows the settling time characteristics of a standard
instrumentation amplifier. Notice that the signal rises above
the range, oscillates, and stabilizes within the acceptable range
of accuracy. Again, the time it takes for the signal to get within
the range of accuracy is the settling time.<BR>
<BR>
Figure 3. Settling Time of an Instrumentation Amplifier
<P>
To better understand the concept, compare amplifier settling time
to the settling time of a spring-mass system. Figure 4a shows
a spring with a mass hanging from it at rest. Figure 4b shows
the spring stretched so that when the mass is released, as in
Figure 4c, it begins to bounce. When the bouncing distance decreases
to within a specified or acceptable range of the resting position,
as in Figure 4d, the system is considered to have settled. The
time from when the spring is released to when its bouncing decreases
to the desired range of motion is the settling time.
<P>
Notice the similarity between the settling of a spring-mass system
and amplifier settling time. When the amplifier applies gain and
the signal is changed to the desired value, a period of time passes
until the signal reaches and stays within the accepted range of
accuracy. This time period is similar to the time the spring-mass
system takes to decrease its bouncing to within the acceptable
range.
<P>
Figure 4. The Settling of a Spring-Mass System
<P>
<B>How to Run Your Own Settling Time Test</B>
<P>
The following sections detail two methods for determining the
settling time of your DAQ board&ETH;one with DC signals and one
with AC signals.
<P>
<B>DC Signal Settling Time Test</B>
<P>
Figure 5 shows the DC signal test, in which two DC signals are
connected to the DAQ board. To run the test, connect a &#177;
signal to channels 1 and 2, respectively. The input signals should
be close to but not above the DAQ board full-scale input range
when a high gain is applied. For example, a &#177;0.048 V input
with a gain of 100 results in a 4.8 V signal, which is 0.2 V less
than the full-scale value of the board. When running this test,
it is important that you do not input a signal greater than or
equal to the full-scale value because this can saturate the amplifier
and result in a longer settling time. Next, complete at least
a 100point single-channel timed data acquisition for each channel
and average the results to obtain a positive and a negative reference
voltage. In Figure&Ecirc;5, these reference voltages are represented
by the lines labeled VREF and -VREF.
<P>
After acquiring the reference values individually, acquire 100
points at the maximum sampling rate for the two channels, alternating
the sampling between the channels; this is also called <I>scanning
</I>the channels. Figure 5 shows these points as dots near the
reference voltage lines.
<P>
Again, average the data; you will use this average to calculate
the settling time error at the maximum sampling rate. In Figure
5, the average of the positive data is 0.04 V; the average of
the negative data is -0.048 V.
<P>
To calculate the error, compute the maximum deviation between
the reference voltages and the positive and negative averages
of the scanned data; in other words, subtract the averaged scanned
data from the positive and negative reference voltages and use
the maximum of the absolute values. This deviation is the amount
of settling time error in voltage at the maximum sampling rate.
In the example in Figure 5, 
<P>
Figure 5. DC Signal Settling Time Test
<P>
the positive and negative deviations are 0.01 V and -0.002&Ecirc;V
respectively, which results in a maximum settling time error of
0.01 V.
<P>
Repeat this process at different sampling rates and gains until
the board settles to the specified accuracy. To plot the error
in least-significant bits (LSBs) versus time, divide the absolute
value of the maximum deviation by the voltage equal to 1 LSB for
the gain you applied. For example, in Figure 5,
<P>
at a gain of 100. Therefore, the error of 0.01 V in Figure 5 equals
409.8 LSBs. Invert the sampling rate to calculate the settling
time with that particular amount of error. At a sampling rate
of 100 kS/s, for example, the settling time is 10 &#181;s. After
the plot is complete, compare the plot to the specified board
accuracy to see how long your board takes to settle to the specified
accuracy.
<P>
<B>AC Signal Settling Time Test</B>
<P>
Figure 6 shows the AC signal test. In Figure 6, a full-scale low-frequency
AC signal is connected to channel&Ecirc;1, and channel 2 is connected
to ground. By alternating the sampling between both channels (scanning)
at the maximum sampling rate, as shown in the top graph in Figure
6, and performing a fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the data from
channel&Ecirc;2, as shown in the bottom graph, you can see if
the amplifier correctly settled.
<P>
If any large spikes appear in the FFT plot at the frequency of
the channel 1 input signal, as in Figure 6, the amplifier did
not settle completely. The magnitude of the spike is the amount
of voltage error; the corresponding settling time is the inverse
of the sampling rate. Notice that using an input signal that is
too high in frequency could cause crosstalk, which would appear
the same as a settling time error in the channel&Ecirc;2 spectrum.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Crosstalk is an expected natural phenomenon caused
by the close proximity of signals and capacitance, which results
in unwanted coupling of the signals. All DAQ boards have a measure
of crosstalk.<BR>

<P>
Figure 6. AC Signal Settling Time Test
<P>
Repeat this process with different sampling rates and gains to
see how quickly the amplifier settles and with what amount of
error. When you have minimized the magnitude of the spike in the
FFT plot, the amplifier has settled correctly. You can use this
process to determine the sampling rate and gain at which you can
acquire data accurately with your DAQ board.
<P>
<B>What Affects Settling Time</B>
<P>
Gain, multiplexing, source output impedance, and transmission
line resistance and capacitance all affect settling time. Gain
and settling time typically have a direct relationship&ETH;during
amplification, the instrumentation amplifier takes longer to settle
at higher gains because of decreased bandwidth and higher signal
resolution.
<P>
Multiplexing can cause settling time to increase when you scan
more than one channel. When you measure DC signals that are input
to multiple channels as the switching occurs between channels,
the input to the instrumentation amplifier becomes a very high-frequency
AC-class signal, as shown in Figure 7.
<P>
Figure 7. Input to Instrumentation Amplifier when Multiplexing
42 DC signals
<P>
With this kind of input, you can see that 42 DC signals that were
originally being applied to the specific channel results in an
AC signal being input to the instrumentation amplifier. This AC
signal forces the amplifier to track the voltages as quickly as
the sampling rate dictates. If the sampling rate is too high,
the amplifier does not have time to settle quickly enough between
voltage swings, producing inaccurate data.
<P>
The most troublesome effect on settling time comes from the combination
of multiplexing and high-output impedance sources. The high impedance
of the source combined with the charging and discharging from
capacitances inherent in the multiplexer during switching can
cause the data to be inaccurate when you scan multiple channels.
As the current being discharged from the multiplexer seeks ground,
the current passes through the high-impedance source; the current
and the high-impedance source combine to produce a voltage. This
voltage is added to the original signal and results in inaccurate
data.
<P>
Transmission line effects also influence settling time when you
use higher impedance sources. The charging associated with the
capacitance in the cable increases the settling time of the system.
The result of the cable capacitance is similar to having small
lowpass filters in the cable that take time to charge and discharge,
causing a decrease in the throughput of the signal.
<P>
<B>Same ADC, Different Settling Time Characteristics</B>
<P>
If you compare the performances of two DAQ boards that have the
same resolution ADCs but different instrumentation amplifiers,
you will notice the extreme variation that differences in settling
times cause. Figures 8 and 9 show the results of the DC signal
settling time tests for two National Instruments multifunction
plug-in DAQ boards&ETH;one board has an off-the-shelf instrumentation
amplifier, and the other contains the NIPGIA&#170;. To create
the graphs in Figures 8 and 9, &#177;0.048 V signals were input
into channels 1 and 2 on each board at a gain of 100, and the
sampling rates were adjusted to demonstrate the effects of settling
time.
<P>
Figure 8. DC Settling Time Test of a Board Using an Off-the-Shelf
Instrumentation Amplifier
<P>
Figure 9. DC Settling Time Test of a Board Using the NI-PGIA
<P>
The low-cost board used to generate Figure 8 contains an off-the-shelf
instrumentation amplifier, which the margin of error illustrates.
The board took between 16 to 17 &#181;s to settle to 0.5 LSB,
the specified accuracy. The high-accuracy, high-performance board
used to generate Figure 9 contains the NI-PGIA instrumentation
amplifier, which National Instruments specifically designed for
plug-in DAQ boards to solve settling time problems. Notice how
much more quickly the NIPGIA settles than the amplifier of the
low-cost board.
<P>
Figure 10 compares the settling time of the NI-PGIA to a standard
off-the-shelf instrumentation amplifier. The NI-PGIA settles to
12-bit accuracy approximately five times faster than the standard
instrumentation amplifier, which the DC signal test also revealed.
<BR>
<BR>
Figure 10. Settling Time of the NI-PGIA Versus an Off-the-Shelf
Instrumentation Amplifier
<P>
<B>About the NI-PGIA</B>
<P>
The NI-PGIA differs from standard off-the-shelf instrumentation
amplifiers because the NIPGIA is specially designed to settle
to 12-bit accuracy within 2 &#181;s. The high accuracy and low
settling time of the NIPGIA is due largely to the input operational
amplifiers (<I>op amps</I>), which operate at close to a closed-loop
gain of 1 regardless of the programmed gain. This differs from
most operational amplifiers, which operate with an increasing
closed-loop gain as the programmed gain increases.
<P>
The design of the NIPGIA allows the bandwidth and linearity to
stay relatively constant as the gain increases. Thus, the settling
time remains within the 2 &#181;s range even at the highest gain
of 100. Nonlinearity is approximately 1.5 parts per million (ppm),
and the gain error for the NIPGIA is &#177;0.02%. The variation
in gain error is due mostly to the ratio matching of the gain-setting
resistors of the NIPGIA. The primary function of the resistors
is to set the NIPGIA gain that is going to be applied to the input
signal.
<P>
While the DC common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of most instrumentation
amplifiers usually decreases as gain decreases, the DC CMRR of
the NIPGIA is nearly independent of the gain. As with most standard
instrumentation amplifiers, the NIPGIA AC CMRR exhibits low-gain
degradation because of internal stray capacitance. The NIPGIA
uses a transconductance design that accurately converts differential
input signals into single-ended signals, eliminates the need for
well-matched resistors within the instrumentation amplifier, and
contributes to the high accuracy of the NIPGIA.
<P>
<B>Reducing Settling Time Effects</B>
<P>
The most effective way to reduce settling time is to use a DAQ
board with an instrumentation amplifier that is guaranteed to
settle to the accuracy you need at all gains and rates. Because
the instrumentation amplifier is where most settling time delay
occurs, select a board with a superior instrumentation amplifier
to acquire the most accurate data. For example, the National Instruments
ATMIO16F5 and ATMIO64F5 boards have the NI-PGIA and can sample
at any gain without experiencing the effects of settling time
if source impedances are kept low.
<P>
If you already have a DAQ board without a special instrumentation
amplifier, there are a few other techniques you can use to reduce
settling time effects on data acquisition. However, none of these
techniques are as effective as using a board with an instrumentation
amplifier that is guaranteed to settle to the accuracy you need
at all rates and gains.
<P>
One technique for handling settling time effects is to specially
arrange the input signals according to whether you are using continuous
or interval-channel scanning, as shown in Figure 11. Signal arrangement
may not be possible in all of your applications, but consider
this method initially.
<P>
To scan channels continuously as quickly as possible with the
same amount of time elapsing between each channel, you should
consider arranging the signals so that the voltage swing is constant
between each channel. When it is time to sample the sequence of
channels again, however, you must sample the first channel twice
to give the amplifier time to settle. By repeating the first channel
sample, the amplifier has the time necessary to compensate for
the maximum swing in voltage.
<P>
Interval scanning involves scanning all the channels as quickly
as possible, with a delay before you begin to sample the first
channel again. This type of scanning allows for the largest voltage
swing on the channels to occur between the last channel sampled
and the repeat 
<P>
Figure 11. Signal Arrangement for Interval and Continuous Channel
Scanning
<P>
of the first channel sample, thus giving the amplifier time to
settle without any extra requirements.
<P>
Selecting the proper cabling material also helps reduce settling
time effects. Cabling is another consideration because of the
capacitance that exists in cables. Avoid selecting cables with
higher capacitances because of the delay time associated with
charging and discharging. To reduce the amount of capacitance
in a cable, keep the cable length as short as possible and select
cables made of a naturally low-capacitance dielectric material
such as polypropylene.
<P>
A final technique you can use to lower settling time effects is
to reduce the sampling rate and to select sources that have low
output impedances. Reducing the sampling rate gives the instrumentation
amplifier the time to settle to the accuracy you want. However,
if you reduce the sampling rate to less than two times the maximum
input frequency, an undersampled waveform and inaccurate data
results.
<P>
When you are unable to use a device with a low output impedance,
you can use a signal conditioning module or amplifier with a low
output impedance that acts as a buffer to the board input. With
this buffer, commonly referred to as a <I>unity-gain buffer</I>or
a <I>voltage follower</I>, the multiplexer can receive low-impedance
signals from high-impedance sources, thus reducing the effects
of settling time.
<P>
When the amplifier does not settle fast enough for your frequency
requirements, you need to consider selecting another DAQ board
that settles at the sampling rate you need.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Selecting the proper DAQ board with regards to settling time consists
of a few key issues. First, determine the maximum sampling rate
and gains your application requires; you must select a DAQ board
that settles to within your specifications. If you already have
a DAQ board, run the DC or AC settling time test to determine
the settling time for your board.
<P>
After you know the constraints of your DAQ board, consider the
output impedance of your signals and arrange your signals if possible
to minimize the swing in voltages between channels. Finally, select
cables that are as short as possible with low resistance and capacitance.
Using these guidelines, you can resolve all of your settling time
concerns and be confident that your acquired data is accurate.

<H1>Measuring Temperature with RTDs</H1>

<H1>David Potter</H1>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
A resistance-temperature detector (RTD) is a temperature sensing
device whose resistance increases with temperature. An RTD consists
of a wire coil or deposited film of pure metal. RTDs can be made
of different metals and have different resistances, but the most
popular RTD is platinum and has a nominal resistance of 100 ohms
at 0 degreesC.
<P>
RTDs are known for their excellent accuracy over a wide temperature
range. Some RTDs have accuracies as high as 0.01ohms (0.026 degrees
C) at 0 degrees C. RTDs are also extremely stable devices. Common
industrial RTDs drift less than 0.1 degrees C/year, and some models
are stable to within 0.0025 degrees C/year.
<P>
RTDs can be difficult to measure because they have relatively
low resistance (100 ohms) that changes only slightly with temperature
(less than 0.4 ohms/degrees C). To accurately measure these small
changes in resistance, you may need to use special configurations
that minimize errors from lead wire resistance.
<P>
Because an RTD is a passive resistive device, you must pass a
current through the device to produce a measurable voltage. This
current causes the RTD to internally heat, which appears as an
error. Self heating is typically specified as the amount of power
that will raise the RTD temperature by 1 degree C, or 1 mW/degree
C. You can minimize self heating by using the smallest possible
excitation current. The amount of self heating also depends heavily
on the medium in which the RTD is immersed. An RTD can self heat
up to 100 times higher in still air than in moving water.
<P>
<B>The Relationship of Resistance and Temperature in RTDs</B>
<P>
Compared to other temperature devices, the output of an RTD is
relatively linear with respect to temperature. The temperature
coefficient, called alpha (a), differs between RTD curves. Although
various manufacturers may specify alpha differently, alpha is
most commonly defined as the change in RTD resistance from 0 to
100 degrees C, divided by the resistance at 0 degrees C, divided
by 100 degrees C:
<P>
a(ohms/ohms/degrees C) = (R100 - R0)/(R0 * 100 degrees C)
<P>
where R100 is the resistance of the RTD at 100 degrees C, and
R0 is the resistance of the RTD at 0 degrees C.
<P>
For example, a 100 ohms platinum RTD with <BR>
a = 0.003911 will measure 139.11 ohms at 100 degrees C. Figure
1 displays a typical resistance-temperature curve for a 100 ohms
platinum RTD.
<P>
Figure 1. Resistance-Temperature Curve for a 100 ohms Platinum
RTD, a = 0.00385
<P>
Although the resistance-temperature curve is relatively linear,
accurately converting measured resistance to temperature requires
curve fitting. The Callendar-Van Dusen equation is commonly used
to approximate the RTD curve:
<P>
Rt = R0[1 + At + Bt2 + C(t - 100)3]
<P>
where Rt is the resistance of the RTD at temperature = t, R0 is
the resistance of the RTD at 0 degrees C, A, B, and C are the
Callendar-Van Dusen coefficients shown in Table 1, and t is the
temperature in  degrees C. For temperatures above 0 degrees C,
the C coefficient equals 0. Therefore, for temperatures above
0 degrees C, this equation reduces to a quadratic. If you pass
a known current, IEX, through the RTD and measure the output voltage
developed across the RTD, V0, you can solve for t:
<P>
where V0 is the measured RTD voltage and IEX is the excitation
current.
<P>
Most platinum RTD curves follow one of three standardized curves&ETH;the
DIN 43760 standard (a = 0.00385), the U.S. Industrial or American
standard (a = 0.003911), or the International Temperature Scale
(ITS-90) that is used with wire-wound RTDs (a = 0.003925). The
Callendar-Van Dusen coefficients for each of these three platinum
RTD curves are listed in Table 1.
<P>
<B>RTD Measurement Circuits</B>
<P>
Because the RTD is a resistive device, you must drive a current
through the device and monitor the resulting voltage. However,
any resistance in the lead wires that connect your measurement
system to the RTD will add error to your readings. For example,
consider a two-wire RTD element connected to a measurement system
that also supplies a constant
<P>
current source, IEX, to drive the RTD. As shown in
<P>
Figure 2, the voltage drop across the lead resistance, RL, adds
to the measured voltage. <BR>

<P>
Figure 2. Two-Wire RTD Measurement
<P>
For example, a lead resistance of 0.3 ohms in each wire, RL, adds
a 0.6 ohms error to the resistance measurement.
<P>
For a platinum RTD with a = 0.00385, the resistance equals a 0.6
ohms/(0.385 ohms/&#161;C) = 1.6 degrees C error.
<P>
If you are using lead lengths greater than 10 ft, you will probably
need to compensate for this lead resistance. The preferred RTD
measurement method is to use a four-wire RTD. One pair of wires
carries the current through the RTD; the other pair senses the
voltage across the RTD. Because only negligible current flows
through the sensing wires, the lead resistance error of RL2 and
RL3 is negligible. This configuration is illustrated in Figure
3.

<P>
To reduce costs, you may instead want to use a three-wire RTD.
By using the three-wire RTD in a Wheatstone configuration with
a current source, as shown in Figure 4a, you can compensate for
the lead resistances. Notice that, in this bridge configuration,
the effects of RL1 and RL3 cancel each other out because they
are located in opposite arms of the bridge. Lead resistance RL2
does not add significant error because little current flows through
it. Alternatively, you can use a current excitation source and
connect the three-wire RTD as shown in Figure 4b. In this configuration,
the resistance of only one lead, RL1, adds error to the measurement.

<B>RTD Measurements with SCXI</B>
<P>
Signal conditioning is generally required to interface an RTD
to a measurement device such as a plug-in data acquisition (DAQ)
board. Signal conditioning produces current excitation for the
RTD, amplifies
<P>
the output signal, and filters the signal to remove
<P>
unwanted noise. You can also use signal conditioning to electrically
isolate the RTD and the monitored sytem from the DAQ system and
the host computer.
<P>
Signal Conditioning eXtensions for Instrumentation (SCXI) is a
signal conditioning front end you can use with plug-in DAQ boards.
SCXI modules condition signals from a variety of signal sources,
such as RTDs, thermistors, and thermocouples, and pass the conditioned
signal to the plug-in DAQ board. The plug-in board can then acquire
the signals directly into PC memory.
<P>
The SCXI product line has a variety of analog and digital signal
conditioning modules for various types of signals. The SCXI1121
is well suited for RTDs. The SCXI1121 is an isolated amplifier
and multiplexer module with four isolated input channels. Each
of the four channels has a jumper-selectable gain amplifier (gains
from 1 to 2,000) and a lowpass filter (4 Hz or 10 kHz). The SCXI1121
also has four channels of isolated voltage or current excitation.
<P>
You can configure each channel independently to produce a constant
0.15 mA, 0.45 mA, 3.333 V, or 10.0 V source.
<P>
<B>Example&ETH;Monitoring 16 RTDs with the SCXI-1121</B>
<P>
For this example, assume that you want to use 16 100 ohms four-wire
RTDs to monitor the efficiency of a production process. You can
monitor all 16 RTDs with four SCXI1121 modules installed in a
fourslot SCXI1000 chassis. The modules and chassis are connected
to a plugin PC DAQ board that acquires the analog signals from
all four modules and stores the digitized readings into PC memory.
<P>
The plugin board in this example is the ATMIO16F-5, which is a
12bit, 200 kHz multifunction I/O board for IBM PC AT and compatible
computers. The ATMIO16F5 board is used in the example because
of its accuracy, high scan rate, and self-calibration capability.
You can also use similar multifunction I/O boards for the Macintosh
and PS/2 platforms with the SCXI system. The SCXI chassis is connected
to the ATMIO16F5 with the SCXI1345 shielded cable assembly, which
is available in lengths up to 10 m. The RTDs are wired into SCXI1320
terminal blocks, which have convenient screw terminals with strain
relief. Figure 5 is a diagram of the system.

An IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible computer controls the temperature
monitoring system. Therefore, application software choices for
controlling the system include National Instruments' LabWindows&#168;
for DOS or LabVIEW&#168; for Windows. Alternatively, you can use
a generalpurpose programming language such as C, BASIC, or Pascal
in DOS or Windows and control the DAQ hardware with the NI-DAQ&#168;
driver software that is included with all National Instruments
plugin DAQ boards.
<P>
<B>Configuring an SCXI System for RTD Measurement</B>
<P>
First, configure the SCXI-1121 modules for the RTD measurements.
Configuring includes setting the excitation mode, gain, and bandwidth
for each input channel of the SCXI-1121. Follow these steps to
configure your SCXI-1121 modules:
<P>
1. Set the Excitation mode. Because you are using four-wire RTDs,
configure each channel for constant current excitation. You can
configure the current source for 0.15 mA or 0.45 mA. The lower
current setting minimizes the RTD self-heating effect.
<P>
2. Set the gain. Determine what gain to apply to your RTD signal.
Be careful to choose the gain so that the output of the SCXI-1121
does not exceed the &#177;5 V input range of the AT-MIO-16F-5,
but produces the optimum resolution. For example, suppose you
will operate your 100 ohms RTD at a temperature up to 300 degrees
C. At this temperature, the RTD resistance increases to about
220 ohms. With a 0.15 mA current source, the voltage output at
300 degrees C will be 220 ohms * 0.15 mA = 33 mV. Setting the
gain of the SCXI-1121 to 100 will generate a maximum voltage output
of 3.3 V, which is within the &#177;5 V input range of the plug-in
board.
<P>
3. Set the bandwidth. The SCXI-1121 has jumper-configurable filters
on each channel. You can set each filter for a cutoff frequency
of 4 Hz or <BR>
10 kHz. The 4 Hz filter is particularly useful for rejecting 60
Hz noise from power lines and lighting.
<P>
Table 2 summarizes a typical SCXI-1121 configuration for measuring
RTDs.

<B>Connecting the RTDs to the SCXI1121</B>
<P>
Connect the RTDs to the SCXI1121 module with a SCXI1320 shielded
terminal block. Alternatively, you can use the SCXI1321 or SCXI1328
terminal blocks, which have special capabilities for strain gauges
and thermocouples, respectively, or the SCXI1330 connector and
shell. Figure 6 shows the wire connections used to correctly wire
a four-wire RTD to channel 0 of an SCXI1320.

<B>Measuring RTD Temperature</B>
<P>
After you have configured and installed the plugin DAQ board and
SCXI1121 modules and have correctly wired the RTDs to the SCXI
terminal block, you can measure the temperature your RTDs sense.
<P>
You can use LabVIEW, LabWindows, or NIDAQ software to easily monitor
the voltages that the RTDs generate. The following software programming
sequences are typical for taking an RTD measurement using each
software package.
<P>
<B>LabVIEW</B>
<P>
Use this programming sequence with LabVIEW:
<P>
1. Configure the software driver to reflect the SCXI hardware
settings. With LabVIEW for Windows, use the <TT>WDAQCONF.EXE 
</TT>utility. With LabVIEW for Macintosh, use the NIDAQ Utilities,
which are in the Control Panels folder. This step informs the
software of which hardware is being used and how the modules are
configured, including which gain value to use when scaling the
data.
<P>
2. Measure the voltage from the RTD channel. You can use highlevel
VIs such as AI Sample Channel and<I> </I>AI Sample Channels, which
are in the Easy I/O palette of the DAQ menu, to measure the voltage
from one or more of the SCXI channels.
<P>
3. Scale the voltage measurement to a temperature reading. LabVIEW
has a virtual instrument (VI) that uses the Callendar-Van Dusen
equation to scale your voltage reading to a temperature reading.
This VI, RTD Convert, is in the DAQ Utilities palette of the DAQ
menu.
<P>
<B>LabWindows</B>
<P>
Use this programming sequence with LabWindows for DOS:
<P>
1. Configure the software driver, using the <TT>DAQCONF.EXE</TT>utility,
to reflect the SCXI hardware settings. This step informs the software
of which hardware is being used and how the modules are configured.
<P>
2. Measure the voltage from the RTD channel. For single-point
voltage measurements, use the function sequence <TT>SCXI_Load_Config
</TT>, <TT>SCXI_Single_Chan_Setup</TT>, <TT>AI_Read</TT>, and
<TT>AI_VScale</TT>. The <TT>AI_VScale</TT> function<TT> </TT>returns
the voltage measured on the RTD channel.
<P>
3. Scale the voltage measurement to a temperature reading. LabWindows
has conversion functions that use the Callendar-Van Dusen equation
to scale your voltage reading to a temperature reading. These
functions, <TT>RTD Convert</TT> for single-point conversions and
<TT>RTD_Buf_Convert</TT><I> </I>for multiple conversions, are
part of the Transducer Conversions instrument driver (<TT>convert.fp
</TT>).
<P>
<B>NI-DAQ</B>
<P>
Use this programming sequence with NIDAQ:
<P>
1. Configure the software driver to reflect the SCXI hardware
settings. With NI-DAQ for Windows, use the <TT>WDAQCONF.EXE</TT>utility.
With NIDAQ for DOS, use the <TT>DAQCONF.EXE</TT> utility. If you
are using NIDAQ for Macintosh, configure the driver with the NIDAQ
Utilities, which are in the Control Panels folder. This step informs
the software of which hardware is being used and how the modules
are configured.
<P>
2. Measure the voltage from the RTD channel. For single-point
voltage measurements, use the function sequence <TT>SCXI_Load_Config
</TT>, <TT>SCXI_Single_Chan_Setup</TT>, <TT>AI_Read</TT>, and
<TT>AI_VScale</TT>. The <TT>AI_VScale</TT> function returns the
voltage measured on the RTD channel.
<P>
3. Scale the voltage measurement to a temperature reading. NIDAQ
has source code files that implement the CallendarVan Dusen formula
to scale your voltage reading to a temperature reading. These
files are called <TT>RTD.c</TT>, <TT>RTD.pas</TT>, and <TT>RTD.bas
</TT>for the C, Pascal, and BASIC programming languages.
<P>
<B>Low-Cost RTD Measurements</B>
<P>
The RTD application examples in this application note use the
SCXI1121 isolation amplifier. The SCXI1121 module has four isolated
and independently configurable excitation channels for each of
the four isolated input channels. If channel-to-channel isolation
is not important, you can configure a less expensive system by
using one current excitation source to power multiple RTDs, as
shown in Figure 8.
<P>
Figure 8. Exciting Multiple RTDs with a Single Current Source
<P>
For example, if you need I/O isolation, you can use one SCXI1121
module to power multiple RTDs
<P>
connected to additional SCXI1120 eight-channel
<P>
isolation amplifier modules. A single SCXI1121 excitation channel
can drive a constant current supply
<P>
through a load of up to 10 kohms. If each RTD resistance will
be limited to 250 ohms, for example, a single SCXI1121 excitation
channel can power up to 40 RTDs in a serial configuration.
<P>
On the other hand, you can supply an external current source to
power your RTDs. If you do not need an SCXI excitation source,
you can use either the SCXI1120 eight-channel isolation amplifier
or the SCXI1100 32channel multiplexer amplifier module.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
RTDs are versatile temperature sensors that have high accuracy
over a wide range of temperatures. Because RTDs are low-resistance
devices, you must be careful when wiring and measuring RTDs to
avoid errors caused by lead resistance. Signal conditioning such
as current excitation and amplification is required to make RTD
measurements with DAQ equipment. A National Instruments SCXI signal
conditioning system has configurable current excitation, amplification,
filtering, and electrical isolation for your RTD applications.
With the SCXI system, you can condition multiple RTD signals and
pass the multiplexed signal to a PC plugin DAQ board.

<H1>Signal Conditioning Fundamentals for PCBased Data Acquisition
Systems</H1>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
PC-based data acquisition (DAQ) systems and plug-in boards are
used in a very wide range of applications in the laboratory, in
the field, and on the manufacturing plant floor. Typically, DAQ
plug-in boards are general-purpose data acquisition instruments
that are well suited for measuring voltage signals.
<P>
However, many real-world sensors and transducers output signals
that must be conditioned before a DAQ board or device can effectively
and accurately acquire the signal. This front-end preprocessing,
which is generally referred to as <I>signal conditioning</I>,
includes functions such as signal amplification, filtering, electrical
isolation, and multiplexing.
<P>
In addition, many transducers require excitation currents or voltages,
bridge completion, linearization, or high amplification for proper
and accurate operation. Therefore, most PC-based DAQ systems include
some form of signal conditioning in addition to the plug-in DAQ
board and personal computer, as shown in Figure 1.
<P>
This application note introduces the fundamentals of using signal
conditioning hardware with PC-based DAQ systems. First, the signal
conditioning requirements of the most common transducers are discussed.
This application note also describes some general signal conditioning
functions and briefly discusses the role of signal conditioning
products such as the National Instruments Signal Conditioning
eXtensions for Instrumentation (SCXI) product line.
<P>
<B>Transducers</B>
<P>
<I>Transducers</I> are devices that convert one type of physical
phenomenon, such as temperature, strain, pressure, or light, into
another. The most common transducers convert physical quantities
to electrical quantities, such as voltage or resistance.
<P>
Transducer characteristics define many of the signal conditioning
requirements of a DAQ system. Table 1 summarizes the basic characteristics
and signal conditioning requirements of some common transducers.

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
The following sections describe thermocouples, resistive-temperature
detectors (RTDs), strain gauges, and current-output devices.
<P>
<B>Thermocouples</B>
<P>
The most popular transducer for measuring temperature is the 
<I>thermocouple</I>. Because the thermocouple is inexpensive,
rugged, and can operate over a very wide range of temperatures,
the thermocouple is a very versatile and useful sensor. However,
the thermocouple has some unique signal conditioning requirements.
<P>
A thermocouple operates on the principle that the junction of
two dissimilar metals generates a voltage that varies with temperature.
However, measuring this voltage is difficult because connecting
the thermocouple to DAQ board measurement wires creates what is
called the <I>reference junction</I> or <I>cold junction</I>,
shown in Figure 2. These additional junctions act as thermocouples
themselves and produce their own voltages. Thus, the final measured
voltage, VMEAS, includes both the thermocouple and reference-junction
voltages. The method of compensating for these unwanted reference-junction
voltages is called <I>cold-junction compensation</I>.
<P>
There are two general approaches to cold-junction compensation&ETH;hardware
and software compensation. Hardware compensation uses a special
circuit that applies the appropriate voltage to cancel the cold-junction
voltage. Although you need no software for hardware compensation,
each thermocouple type must have its own compensation circuit
that works at all ambient temperatures, which can be expensive.
<P>
Software cold-junction compensation, on the other hand, is very
flexible and requires only knowing the ambient temperature. If
you use an additional sensor to directly measure the ambient temperature
at the cold junction, software can compute the appropriate
<P>
Figure 2. A Thermocouple Connected to a DAQ Boardcompensation
for the unwanted thermoelectric voltages. This is why many signal
conditioning accessories are equipped with direct-reading temperature
sensors, such as thermistors or semiconductor sensors, installed
at the terminals. Software cold-junction compensation follows
this process:
<P>
1. Measure the temperature of the reference junction and compute
the equivalent thermocouple voltage for this junction using standard
thermocouple tables or polynomials.
<P>
2. Measure the output voltage (VMEAS) and add&ETH;<I>not</I> subtract
the reference-junction voltage computed in step 1.
<P>
3. Convert the resulting voltage to temperature using standard
thermocouple polynomials or look-up tables.
<P>
Many software packages, such as LabVIEW&#168;, LabWindows&#168;,
and NI-DAQ&#168;, include routines that perform these temperature-to-voltage
and voltage-to-temperature conversions for different types of
thermocouples according to National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) standard reference tables.
<P>
Sensitivity is another characteristic to consider with thermocouple
measurements. Thermocouple outputs are very low level and change
only 7 to 50 &#181;V for every 1 degrees C change in temperature.
You can increase the sensitivity of the system with a low-noise,
high-gain amplification of the signal. For example, a plug-in
DAQ board with an analog input range of &#177;5 V, an amplifier
gain of 100, and a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has
the following resolution:
<P>
However, the same DAQ board with a signal conditioner amplifier
gain of 1,000 has a resolution of 2.4 &#181;V/bit, which corresponds
to a fraction of a degree Celsius. More importantly, an external
signal conditioner can amplify the low-level thermocouple signal
close to the source, which minimizes noise corruption. A high-level
amplified signal suffers much less corruption from radiated noise
in the environment and in the PC than a low-level unamplified
signal.
<P>
<B>RTDs</B>
<P>
Another popular temperature-sensing device is the <I>RTD</I>,
which is known for its stability and accuracy over a wide temperature
range. An RTD consists of a wire coil or deposited film of pure
metal whose resistance increases with temperature. Although RTDs
constructed with different metals and resistance are available,
the most popular type of RTD is made of platinum and has a nominal
resistance of 100 ohms at 0 degrees C.
<P>
Because an RTD is a passive resistive device, you must pass a
current through the RTD to produce a voltage that a DAQ board
can measure. RTDs have relatively low resistance (100 ohms) that
changes only slightly with temperature (less than 0.4 ohms/ degreesC),
so you might need to use special configurations that minimize
errors from lead wire resistance.
<P>
For example, consider the measurement of a two-wire RTD in Figure
3. With this RTD, labeled RT, the voltage drops caused by the
excitation current, IEXC, passing through the lead resistances,
RL, add to the measured voltage, VO.
<P>
Figure 3. A Two-Wire RTD
<P>
For longer lead lengths, therefore, the fourwire RTD in Figure
4 is a better choice. With a four-wire RTD, one pair of wires
carries the excitation current through the RTD; the other pair
senses the voltage across the RTD. Because only negligible current
flows through the sensing wires, the lead resistance error is
very small.
<P>
Figure 4. A Four-Wire RTD
<P>
To keep costs down, RTDs are also available in three-wire configurations.
The three-wire RTD is most effective in a Wheatstone bridge configuration
(see the following <I>Strain Gauges</I> section). In this configuration,
the lead resistances are located in opposite arms of the bridge,
so their errors cancel each other out.
<P>
<B>Strain Gauges</B>
<P>
The <I>strain gauge</I> is the most common device used in mechanical
testing and measurements. The most common type is the bonded-resistance
strain gauge, which consists of a grid of very fine foil or wire.
The electrical resistance of the grid varies linearly with the
strain applied to the device. When using a strain gauge, you bond
the strain gauge to the device under test, apply force, and measure
the strain by detecting changes in resistance. Strain gauges are
also used in sensors that detect force or other derived quantities,
such as acceleration, pressure, and vibration. These sensors generally
contain a pressure-sensitive diaphragm with strain gauges mounted
to the diaphragm.
<P>
Because strain measurement requires detecting relatively small
changes in resistance, the Wheatstone bridge circuit is almost
always used. The Wheatstone bridge circuit consists of four resistive
elements with a voltage excitation supply applied to the ends
of the bridge. Strain gauges can occupy one, two, or four arms
of the bridge, with any remaining positions filled with fixed
resistors. Figure 5 shows a configuration with a half-bridge strain
gauge consisting of two strain elements, RG1 and RG2, combined
with two fixed resistors, R1 and R2.
<P>
Figure 5. Half-Bridge Strain Gauge Configuration
<P>
With a voltage, VEXC, powering the bridge, the DAQ system measures
the voltage across the bridge:
<P>
When the ratio of RG1 to RG2 equals the ratio of R1 to R2 , the
measured voltage VO is 0 V. This condition is referred to as a
<I>balanced bridge</I>. As strain is applied to the gauges, their
resistance values change, causing a change in the voltage at VO.
Full-bridge and half-bridge strain gauges are designed for maximum
sensitivity by arranging the strain gauge elements in opposing
directions.
<P>
For example, the half-bridge strain gauge in Figure 5 includes
an element RG1, which is installed so that its resistance increases
with positive strain, and an element RG2, whose resistance decreases
with positive strain. The resulting VO responds with a sensitivity
that is twice that of a quarter-bridge configuration.
<P>
Some signal conditioning products have voltage excitation sources,
as well as provisions for bridge-completion resistors. Bridge
completion resistors should be very precise and stable. Because
strain-gauge bridges are rarely perfectly balanced, some signal
conditioners also null offsets, a process in which you adjust
the resistance ratio of the unstrained bridge to balance the bridge
and remove any initial DC offset voltage. Alternatively, you can
measure this initial offset voltage and use this measurement in
your conversion routines to compensate for the unbalanced initial
condition.
<P>
<B>Current Signals</B>
<P>
Many sensors that are used in process control and monitoring applications
output a current signal, usually 4 to 20 mA or 0 to 20 mA. Current
signals are sometimes used because they are less sensitive to
errors such as radiated noise and lead resistance voltage drops.
Signal conditioners must convert this current signal to a voltage
signal. To do this easily, pass the current signal through a resistor,
as shown in Figure 6.
<P>
Figure 6. Current Signals and Signal Conditioning
<P>
You can then use a DAQ system to measure the voltage VO = ISR
that will be generated across the resistor, where IS is the current
and R is the resistance. Select the resistor value that has a
usable range of voltages, and use a high-precision resistor with
a low temperature coefficient. For example, the SCXI Process-Current
Resistor Kit consists of 249 ohms, 0.1%, 
5 ppm/ degrees C resistors. These resistor values will convert
a 4 to 20 mA current loop into a voltage signal that varies from
0.996 to 4.98 V.
<P>
<B>General Signal Conditioning Functions</B>
<P>
Regardless of the types of sensors or transducers you are using,
the proper signal conditioning equipment can improve the quality
and performance of your system. Signal conditioning functions
are useful for all types of signals, including amplification,
filtering, and isolation.
<P>
<B>Amplification</B>
<P>
Unwanted noise can play havoc with the measurement accuracy of
a PC-based DAQ system. The effects of system noise on your measurements
can be extreme if you are not careful. Signal conditioning circuitry
with amplification, which applies gain outside of the PC chassis
and near the signal source, can increase measurement resolution
and effectively reduce the effects of noise. An amplifier, whether
located directly on the DAQ board or in external signal conditioners,
can apply gain to the small signal before the ADC converts the
signal to a digital value. Boosting the input signal uses as much
of the ADC input range as possible.
<P>
However, many transducers produce voltage output signals on the
order of millivolts or even microvolts. Amplifying these low-level
analog signals directly on the DAQ board also amplifies any noise
picked up from the signal lead wires or from within the computer
chassis. When the input signal is as small as microvolts, this
noise can drown out the signal itself, leading to meaningless
data.
<P>
A simple method for reducing the effects of system noise on your
signal is to amplify the signal as close to the source as possible,
which boosts the analog signal above the noise level before noise
in the lead wires or computer chassis can corrupt the signal.
<P>
For example, a J-type thermocouple outputs a very low-level voltage
signal that varies by about 50 &#181;V/ degrees C. Suppose that
the thermocouple leads must travel 10 m through an electrically
noisy plant environment to the DAQ system. If the various noise
sources in the environment couple 200 &#181;V onto the thermocouple
leads, you obtain a noisy temperature reading with about 4 degrees
 C of noise. However, amplifying the signal close to the thermocouple
before noise corrupts the signal alleviates this problem. Amplifying
the signal with a gain of 500 with a signal conditioner placed
near the thermocouple produces a thermocouple signal that varies
by about 25 mV/ degrees C. As this high-level signal travels the
same 10 m, the 200 &#181;V of noise coupled onto this signal after
amplification has much less of an effect on the final measurement,
adding only a fraction of a degree Celsius of noise to the measured
temperature reading.
<P>
<B>Filtering and Averaging</B>
<P>
You can also use filters to reject unwanted noise within a certain
frequency range. Many systems will exhibit 60 Hz periodic noise
components from sources such as power supplies or machinery. Lowpass
filters on your signal conditioning circuitry can eliminate unwanted
high-frequency components. However, be sure to select the filter
bandwidth carefully so that you do not affect the time response
of your signals.
<P>
Although many signal conditioners include lowpass noise filters
to remove unwanted noise, an extra precaution is to use software
averaging to remove additional noise. <I>Software</I> <I>averaging
</I>is a simple and effective technique of digitally filtering
acquired readings; for every data point you need, the DAQ system
acquires and averages many voltage readings. For example, a common
approach is to acquire 100 points and average those points for
each measurement you need. For slower applications in which you
can oversample in this way, averaging is a very effective noise
filtering technique.
<P>
<B>Isolation</B>
<P>
Improper grounding of the DAQ system is the most common cause
of measurement problems and damaged DAQ boards. Isolated signal
conditioners can prevent most of these problems by passing the
signal from its source to the measurement device without a galvanic
or physical connection. Isolation breaks ground loops, rejects
high common-mode voltages, and protects expensive DAQ instrumentation.
<P>
Common methods for circuit isolation include using optical, magnetic,
or capacitive isolators. Magnetic and capacitive isolators modulate
the signal to convert it from a voltage to a frequency. The frequency
can then be transmitted across a transformer or capacitor without
a direct physical connection before being converted back to a
voltage value.
<P>
When you connect your sensor or equipment ground to your DAQ system,
you will see any potential difference in the grounds on both inputs
to your DAQ system. This voltage is referred to as <I>common-mode
voltage</I>. If you are using a single-ended measurement 
<P>
Figure 7. Single-Ended DAQ Measurement System
<P>
system, as shown in Figure 7, the measured voltage includes the
voltage from the desired signal, VS, as well as this common-mode
voltage from the additional ground currents in the system, VG.
<P>
If you are using a DAQ board with differential inputs, you can
reject some of this common-mode voltage, typically up to 12 V.
However, larger ground potential differences, or ground loops,
will damage unprotected DAQ devices. If you cannot remove the
ground references, use isolating signal conditioners that break
these ground loops and reject very large common-mode voltages.
For example, SCXI isolation amplifier modules can operate with
up to 250 Vrms of common-mode voltage.
<P>
Isolators also provide an important safety function by protecting
against high-voltage surges from sources like power lines, lightning,
or high-voltage equipment. When dealing with high voltages, a
surge can damage the equipment or even harm equipment operators.
By breaking the galvanic connection, isolated signal conditioners
produce an effective barrier between the DAQ system and these
high-voltage surges.
<P>
<B>Multiplexing</B>
<P>
Signal conditioners equipped with signal multiplexers can cost-effectively
expand the input/output (I/O) capabilities of your plug-in DAQ
board. The typical plug-in DAQ board has 8 to 16 analog inputs
and 8 to 24 digital I/O lines. External multiplexers can increase
the I/O capacity of a plug-in board to hundreds and even thousands
of channels. Analog input multiplexers use solid-state or relay
switches to sequentially switch, or <I>scan</I>, multiple analog
input signals onto a single channel of the DAQ board. For higher
speed applications, be sure that the multiplexing circuit, as
well as the DAQ board, can operate at the needed scanning rates.
<P>
<B>Digital Signal Conditioning</B>
<P>
Digital signals can also require signal conditioning peripherals.
Usually, you should not directly connect digital signals used
in research and industrial environments to a DAQ board without
some type of isolation because of the possibility of large voltage
spikes or large common-mode voltages. Some signal conditioning
modules and boards optically isolate the digital I/O signals to
remove these problems. Digital I/O signals can control electromechanical
or solid-state relays to switch loads such as solenoids, lights,
motors, and so on. You can also use solid-state relays to sense
high-voltage field signals and convert them to digital signals.
<P>
<B>Signal Conditioning Systems for PC-Based DAQ Systems</B>
<P>
The signal conditioning functions discussed in this application
note are implemented in different types of signal conditioning
products. These products cover a very wide range of price and
capability. For example, the National Instruments SC-207X Series
termination boards have a temperature sensor for use with thermocouples
and a breadboard area with silkscreened component locations for
easy addition of current measurement resistors, simple resistance-capacitance
(RC) filters, and other signal conditioning circuitry.
<P>
The 5B Series of signal conditioning I/O modules is for specific
types of transducers or signals. You can install up to 16 I/O
modules in a backplane and directly connect the modules to a plug-in
DAQ board.

For external signal multiplexing, the AMUX-64T analog multiplexer
board expands the analog input capability of your I/O multifunction
board to up to 256 channels. The AMUX-64T also includes a temperature
sensor and silkscreened component locations.
<P>
The SCXI product line is a signal conditioning system that combines
the expandability of multiplexing with the flexibility of modular
signal conditioning.
<P>
<B>Signal Conditioning with SCXI</B>
<P>
SCXI is a signal conditioning and instrumentation front end for
plug-in DAQ boards. An SCXI system consists of an SCXI chassis
that houses one or more signal conditioning modules that multiplex,
amplify, isolate, and condition both analog and digital signals.
The SCXI system then passes the conditioned signals to a single
plug-in DAQ board for acquisition directly into the PC, as shown
in Figure 8.
<P>
A variety of SCXI modules are available with different signal
conditioning capabilities. For example, the SCXI-1120 module is
an eight-channel isolation amplifier module. Each of the input
channels includes
<P>
an isolation amplifier with gains of up to 2,000 and a lowpass
filter configurable for gains of 4 Hz or 10 kHz. The SCXI-1121
module is a four-channel isolation amplifier module that also
has four channels of excitation. You can configure each excitation
channel for voltage or current. The module also includes half-bridge
completion circuitry for strain-gauge measurements.
<P>
Terminal blocks for the SCXI modules include temperature sensors
for cold-junction compensation with thermocouples.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Signal conditioning is an important component of a complete PC-based
DAQ system. Signal conditioning has many features that you can
use to connect sensors such as thermocouples, RTDs, strain gauges,
and current-output devices to PC-based DAQ boards. No matter what
sensors you are using, signal conditioning can improve the accuracy,
effectiveness, and safety of your measurements because of capabilities
such as amplification, isolation, and filtering. The National
Instruments SCXI product line can supply the signal conditioning
and instrumentation front end you need for your PC-based DAQ systems.

<p>Hi, my name is Craig van Rij. I am a PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering
department. My work is in the <a href="http://www.mech.canterbury.ac.nz/research/SE.htm">Stirling
Engine Group</a> working with Stirling Cycle engines for RAPS&nbsp;type
applications. Specifically my research is concerned with the <a href="http://www.mech.canterbury.ac.nz/student/postgrad/cvrphd.htm">optimization
of the combustion</a> systems for these engines.</p>

<p>My main field of interest is in mechanical engineering design and CAD.
I do all of my design work using Microstation and Modeler from Bentley
and enjoy using computers for the majority of my work. I have spent the
last 12 months designing and building a 3kW generator set based on the
earlier work done on 200W Stirling engines within this department.</p>

<p>I live here in Christchurh with my wife Veronica who is at the College
of Education doing Secondary school training.</p>

Kathrin Winkelmann's Exciting Home Page

<BODY>
<H1>Hello</H1><BR>
 <BR>
<H3><STRONG>Under Construction</H3>
But since Kathrin is too slack to do anything about it, I will.

Kathrin is from Germany which is on the other side of the planet.
Germany is famous for beer (a good thing) and men in short, tight
leather pants (a not so good thing).  Kathrin's boyfriend (also a Geman national) likes playing
with rocks (a not so good thing for Kathrin), fortunately they are
volcanic most of the time and Kathrin is allowed to play with them
too.<BR>
<BR>
Kathrin sings in a beautiful choir which charges people to go and see them, and
listen too, so they must be good.<BR>
<BR>
Kathrin is German for Kathrine, while Winklemann means "to wink at men
in a seductive manner hinting at possible future liasons".<BR>

<P> It was a nice bike. Redlined at 17 000 rpm. Stood up to my abusing
the clutch the first few days as I learnt to ride.<BR>
250 fours are actually quite easy to ride, as they have predictable power
(ie very little) and good handling/braking.<BR>
The downside is when this happens...</P>

<P> The GSXR photos were all taken before I started to spend money on it...so
don't laugh! But is is a nice bike, even though it still is a bit tatty

<P> Well It was mine for 2 whole hours while I &quot;supervised&quot; it
at a open day at the School of Engineering. That particular Britten was
one of the V-1100's, the model before the V-1000, distigushed by the blockly
front suspension and the straight through exhaust. It is used by the company
as the display model as the internals of the motor and some parts of the
frame are seriously shot. </P>

I use George Xie's
<a href="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/spider/q7f192/branch/checker.html">Anchor
Checker</a> to check the ``liveness'' of the URLs in this page.

<hr>

<em>
I enjoy hearing that other people find this page useful or
entertaining.  However, it was originally meant as my personal list of
links I'd like to find again for some reason or other.  It isn't
something that was meant to help companies or random people advertise
their pages.  I enjoy the nice ego-boost of ``Hey! I like your page.
You might like &lt;blah&gt;.  It's bizarre.'' But things like ``Please
add my page &lt;blah&gt; to your database.'' just annoy me.

<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART:</A></H3>

Using the instructions in this file, you will create a 3D computer model
of the Steel Bracket illustrated above.  This model will contain several
<EM>features</EM> (indeed, one of our aims is to clarify the notion of
what a `feature' is).  Even though there are many features, the entire
bracket is considered to be a single <EM>part</EM> since it is composed
of continuous material.<P>

The bracket is a fairly challenging part for a novice modeller, and may
take you some time to construct.  We estimate that you may need about
90 minutes (i.e. most of your first session).  An experienced user of
Pro/ENGINEER might take 5 minutes for the same task.  Don't be
disheartened by this -- your proficiency will rapidly increase!<P>

Start creating your Bracket part now.  If you still have the image of
the cylinder in the main graphics window, clear it by selecting
<B>Quit Window</B> from the MAIN menu.  Notice that when you do this,
the PART menu disappears to be replaced by the MODE window so that you
are ready to create a new part in the (now empty) graphics window.<P>

Now from the MODE menu, select <B>Part -&gt; Create</B><P>

Notice that you are being prompted in Pro/ENGINEER's message window.
In response to this you should type the name `bracket' (without quotes)
as the name of your new part. In standard notation:

<P><KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0002]: <B>bracket &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

When you do this, the text in the titlebar of the main graphics window
changes to <I><B>**********Pro/ENGINEER Part: BRACKET**********</B></I>,
signifying that this is now the name of the current part in the active
window.  Since Pro/ENGINEER can have several parts, assemblies and
drawings open simultaneously in multiple windows, the asterisks are used
to indicate the currently active window.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="datums">DATUM PLANES (the first feature):</A></H3>

For this bracket (and all remaining parts in this set of exercises), you
will begin by creating a set of default <EM>datum planes</EM>.  These
are reference planes for use in defining all later geometry of the part.
They are not solid objects, and they won't show up in shaded images of
the part -- think of them as representing invisible, infinite planes.<P>

From the PART menu, select 
<P><B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Datum -&gt; Plane -&gt; Default</B><P>

A set of three datum planes will appear on the screen.  Study the 
arrangement of these planes for a moment.  The following images may
help you see how the planes are positioned in relation to each other.
The image on the right shows the planes as if they were opaque.
<P>
<IMG SRC="BRACKET/datum_planes.gif"><P>

Note that datum planes are usually created singly <EM>except</EM>
where default datum planes are the first feature created in the part.
The three you see on the screen are actually three separate features.<P>

Datum planes in Pro/ENGINEER have two sides: a <EM>front side</EM>
and a <EM>rear side</EM>.  The front side of a datum plane is always
shown with a yellow border, whereas the rear side is shown with a red
border.  Clearly, you are looking at the front side of all three planes.
Arrows have been added to the figures above to indicate the directions in
which the front sides of the three datum planes are considered to face.
These directions are the outward normals to each plane.<P>

The following image illustrates the way front and rear sides of a datum
plane face in opposite directions ...

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_angle">EXTRUDED ANGLE SECTION:</A></H3>

You are now ready to create the first solid feature of the Bracket.  This
is generally chosen to be the major solid block from which the part will
be formed, and it should not contain too much geometrical detail.  For
the bracket, we will create this feature as a sharp-sided L-shaped
<EM>extruded protrusion</EM> (or extrusion, for short).  Pro/ENGINEER
uses the word `protrusion' to refer to a generalised blob of material.<P>

An extrusion is defined by
<UL>
<LI>first defining a sketching plane, then 
<LI>sketching the cross-sectional shape, and then
<LI>specifying how far this cross-section is to be extruded out from the
    plane in which the sketch has been made.
</UL>
<EM>By default, extrusions are always made towards the viewer</EM>
(i.e. out of the screen, when looking straight at the sketching plane).<P>

A general note may be helpful here concerning Pro/ENGINEER's default
menu selections.  Command menus will often appear on the screen with 
certain options already highlighted in red.  These are the default values,
and if they are suitable to you they do not need to be clicked again with
the mouse pointer (although that does no harm).  They can, of course, be
over-ridden by selecting different options on the menu, and they can be
re-selected if you change your mind.  In these notes, all the selections
required for building a given command string will be listed (both the 
defaults and those options which need to be actually clicked).<P>

From the FEAT menu, select
<P><B>Create -&gt; Solid | Protrusion -&gt; Extrude | Solid | Done -&gt; One Side | Blind | Done</B><P>

At this point you must define your sketching plane, so that Pro/ENGINEER
knows where to use your cross-sectional information.  You should see the
PRE_SKETCH and SETUP_PLANE and GET_SELECT menus on the screen (under the
MAIN menu, which is always present), and you are being requested to 
pick a sketching plane (... check the text in the message window). 
Using the LEFT mouse button, pick on DTM1 (datum plane no. 1) in the 
main graphics window, either by picking on its name or border.<P>

Notice the temporary arrow which now appears pointing out from DTM1, and read
the prompt in the Message Window.  Since the proposed direction of feature
creation is satisfactory, select <B>Okay</B> from the DIRECTION menu.<P>

There is one more step to take before you can start sketching.  Having
selected DTM1 as your sketching plane, you need to tell Pro/ENGINEER how to
orient this sketching plane on the screen (i.e. tell it `which way is up').
To do this, you must identify a plane that will be used as a horizontal or
vertical reference in the sketch view.  Such a reference plane must always
be perpendicular to the sketching plane.  In this case, since DTM1 will be
facing directly out from the screen, we could specify either that
<UL>
<LI>datum plane DTM2 shall face towards the <I>top</I> of the screen, or
<LI>datum plane DTM3 shall face towards the <I>left</I> of the screen,
</UL>
both of which are equivalent specifications.  From the SKET VIEW menu, select:
<P><B>Top</B><P>
and pick DTM2 (pick on its name or border using the LEFT mouse button).
This means that the yellow side of DTM2 will face towards the top of the
screen in the sketch view, and therefore that DTM2 will be the horizontal
reference for the section you are about to sketch.  In most cases it is best
to use one of the original three datum planes for this kind of reference.<P>

You have now given Pro/ENGINEER enough information to define a sketching
plane, so it presents you with the sketch view looking like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/sketch_view_blank.gif"><P>

Your view will also have a grid of faint lines to aid sketching.
Notice the yellow and red sides of the `edge-on' planes DTM2 and DTM3.
Are they facing the directions you expected them to ?<P>

You will have been placed automatically into the
<B>Sketcher -&gt; Mouse Sketch</B> mode, so you can immediately start
sketching.  Using the LEFT mouse buttons (to create lines), sketch the
cross section exactly as shown below (the small numbers are intended as
a guide to your sequence of points).  Use the MIDDLE mouse button to
end line creation.  Be careful not to create tiny little line segments
accidentally, as these will cause problems when you try to dimension and
regenerate the sketch later.  If you do create such problem lines, try
to delete them using the <B>Delete -&gt; Delete Many -&gt; Pick Many</B>
options.

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/angle_sectn.gif"><P>

Now you must dimension your sketch.  Four dimensions are required to
define the shape of this section (i.e. the overall length, the overall
height, and the thicknesses of the vertical and horizontal arms).
Select <B>Dimension</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  Creation of the first
dimension is described in the following diagram. Create all four dimensions
in a similar fashion.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/angle_dim_first.gif"><P>

Finally you must align the section to the existing part (i.e. to the
existing datum planes).  Pro/ENGINEER needs to be told that you want the
right-most vertical line aligned with datum DTM3, and the lower horizontal
line aligned with datum DTM2.  Select <B>Alignment</B> from the SKETCHER
menu.  Then click once on the right-most vertical line and once on DTM3.
The message window should confirm that the two entities have been
`-- ALIGNED --'.  Similarly click once on the lower horizontal line and 
once on DTM2 to align them.<P>

You have given Pro/ENGINEER all the information needed for it to reconstruct
the section, so select <B>Regenerate</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  If all 
goes well, you will see an encouraging confirmation in the message window.
Furthermore Pro/ENGINEER will assign a value to each of the symbolic
dimensions, and place you immediately into <B>Modify</B> mode so that you
can adjust the dimensions as desired.<P>

Specify the following dimensions:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/angle_dim_all.gif"><P>
and select <B>Regenerate | Done</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  The cross
section is now complete, and you are being prompted to enter an extrusion
depth.  The desired value in this case is 300mm.

<P><KBD>Enter depth [216.51]: <B>300 &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

Congratulations!  Your part now contains four features, namely the 3
datum planes and a (new) extruded protrusion.  To obtain an isometric,
shaded view, select:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Orientation -&gt; Default</B><P>
and then:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Cosmetic -&gt; Shade -&gt; Display</B>

<H3><A NAME="saving">SAVING YOUR WORK:</A></H3>

This is a good time to save your bracket model.  From the MAIN menu, select:
<P><B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B><P>
... and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> (i.e. the [RETURN] key) to accept the
default object being offered for saving (see the prompt in the message
window).  Pro/ENGINEER confirms that the model has been stored to a file.
If you were to check the contents of your current working directory, you
would find that there is a new file there called <KBD>bracket.prt.1</KBD>
 -- the `<KBD>prt</KBD>' extension indicates that it is a <EM>part</EM> file,
and the `<KBD>.1</KBD>' suffix is a file version number.  Pro/ENGINEER
keeps all file versions unless explicitly instructed to delete out-dated
ones, so next time you save your part you will have two part files in the
directory (<KBD>bracket.prt.1</KBD> and <KBD>bracket.prt.2</KBD>), and so on.
This is generally a good thing, except that it generates large numbers of
files which can fill up the disk unless you occasionally purge them.
For the moment, go ahead and  save your model whenever you get to a useful
new stage in its development, and we will discuss purging later.<P>

It is also worth knowing that Pro/ENGINEER not only stores models on file,
it also lets them hang around in memory.  To demonstrate this, select 
<B>Quit Window</B> from the MAIN menu.  (Go on!  It's safe -- you just stored
it, didn't you?)  Now we will retrieve the part, not from disk, but from
Pro/ENGINEER's program memory.  From the MODE menu, select:<P>
<B>Part -&gt; Search/Retr</B><P>
The <B>Search/Retr</B> option is very useful, since it means you don't have
to remember any filenames or do any typing.  Notice that there are two
options in the lower half of the SELECT FILE menu:
<UL>
<LI><B>Current Dir</B> is the default, and searches the current directory;
<LI><B>In Session</B> searches program memory for every relevant object
    you have worked with in the current Pro/ENGINEER session.
</UL>

Select <B>In Session -&gt; BRACKET.PRT</B><P>
... and you should be back where you were a few minutes earlier.  Notice
that the cylinder part (PRT0001.PRT) was also available, even though you
quit that window ages ago.<P>

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_rounds">ROUNDED EDGES:</A></H3>

You will now put some rounded fillets on three edges of the extrusion,
to make it look more like a real piece of angle section.  This is easily
achieved with the Pro/ENGINEER `Round' feature.<P>

Starting from the PART menu, select the following command string.<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Round -&gt; Edge | Constant |
Circular | No End Srf | Done</B><P>

You are now prompted to `<KBD>Specify edges to be
rounded/filleted</KBD>' by picking edges from the graphics window with
the LEFT mouse button.  Pick the edges shown highlighted in blue in the
next diagram, and then select <B>Done</B> from below the EDGE SEL menu.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/edge_sel.gif"><P>

When prompted to specify a radius value option from the RADIUS
VAL menu, select <B>Enter</B> from that menu, and respond to the prompt
for a radius in the message window as follows:<P>
<KBD>Enter RADIUS [0.7500]: <B>8</B></KBD><P>

The fillets now appear.  Shade the image to see them better, i.e. select:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Cosmetic -&gt; Shade -&gt; Display</B><P>

Note that although there are three fillets, they all belong to only one
feature in your part.  They could have been created separately, but there
was no advantage in doing this, since they all had essentially the same
specification.  We could call this a `compound' feature.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_slot_hole">A SLOT AND A HOLE:</A></H3>

It is generally best not to work on a shaded image of a part when creating or
modifying features, so select <B>View -&gt; Regen View</B> to return to the
`Hidden Line' representation of your bracket. These instructions will also
assume that you are viewing the part in its default orientation.<P>

You will now create a slot and a hole in the 80mm-wide leg of the angle
section.  This will be another compound feature, since the hole and slot
will be created as a single <EM>cut</EM> feature (although they could
just as well be created separately).  Just as a protrusion is the most
general kind of `material addition' feature in Pro/ENGINEER, a cut is the
most general kind of `material removal' feature (much more general and
powerful, for example, than either the <EM>hole</EM> feature or the
<EM>slot</EM> feature of Pro/ENGINEER, which are almost never used).<P>

Similarly to the extrusion, a cut is defined by
<UL>
<LI>first defining a sketching plane, then
<LI>sketching the cross-sectional shape, and then
<LI>specifying how far this cross-section is to be extruded inwards
    (as if using a biscuit cutter) from the plane in which the sketch has
    been made.
</UL>
<EM>By default, cuts are always made away from the viewer</EM>
(i.e. into the screen, when looking straight at the sketching plane).
This is more-or-less the opposite to the case for an extrusion.<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Cut -&gt; Extrude | Solid |
Done -&gt; One Side | Thru All | Done</B><P>

Let's say we want to define the shape of the hole and slot by sketching
a cross-section on the <EM>underside</EM> of the part.  Now when you are
prompted to pick (or create) a sketching plane, an interesting problem
arises -- how do you point to regions of your model which lie behind
solid material?  We would like to be able to point to the underside of
the part without having to spin the view.  This is the sort of situation
where Pro/ENGINEER's `query select' facility comes in useful.  Select:
<P><B>Query Sel</B><P>
from the GET SELECT menu, and note the comment in the message window.

Pick a point on the screen directly on the (underside of) the longer leg
of the part.  Because the top surface of this part is the first solid
surface encountered by Pro/ENGINEER when it looks where you have picked,
it highlights the upper face (which is not the one you want).  But
notice that a CONFIRM menu has appeared under the GET SELECT menu, so 
that you can tell Pro/ENGINEER to continue looking for items `below the
surface'.  Select <B>Next</B> from the CONFIRM menu, and the next item
highlighted in red on the graphics window should be the one you want --
the underside of the part.  Select <B>Accept</B> from the CONFIRM menu.<P>

An arrow appears indicating a proposed direction for the creation of the
cut (i.e. upwards from the underside of the part into solid material).
This direction is fine, so select <B>Okay</B>.  Note that when you enter
sketcher mode, you will be looking in the direction of creation of the
cut (i.e. you will be looking directly at the lower surface of the part).<P>

When prompted to pick a horizontal or vertical reference plane for
sketching, ensure that <B>Bottom</B> is highlighted in the SKET VIEW menu,
and pick DTM3.  This means that the yellow side of datum plane 3 will be
made to face the bottom of the screen in sketch view.  As soon as you
do this, Pro/ENGINEER will take you into sketcher mode.  If you have 
carefully followed instructions, the screen will look like this: 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch1.gif"><P>

There are many ways to sketch a slot efficiently -- here is just one
suggestion.  Begin by mouse-sketching a horizontal line near the right-hand
end of your view of the part.  Then, from the GEOMETRY menu, select 
<B>Line -&gt; Centreline</B>, and sketch a horizontal centreline a little
below your first line.  The result should look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch2.gif"><P>

Now select <B>Mouse Sketch</B> again, and use the RIGHT mouse button
carefully to draw two tangent arcs from the ends of the first line. 
Try to locate the centres of these arcs on the centreline, as shown: 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch3.gif"><P>

Although your section is not yet complete, it is useful to partially
dimension and regenerate it, so that the geometrical constraints can be
`locked-in'.  This helps prevent a section becoming too confused and
complex.  Select <B>Dimension</B> again, and see if you can achieve
a regenerated sketch looking like the following:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch4.gif"><P>

Now, starting from the SKETCHER menu, select <B>Geom Tools -&gt; Mirror</B>
and in response to the prompt, pick the centreline you have already drawn.
You want to mirror all the entities in your sketch about this centreline, 
so select <B>All | Done</B> from the MIRROR menu.  Bingo!  You now have
a sketch of the full slot.  However, the dimensioning is a bit unorthodox
(slots are usually dimensioned across their full width), so delete the
11mm half-width dimension, and replace it with a new dimension between the
upper and lower horizontal lines.  Regenerate to obtain the following result:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch5.gif"><P>

Finally let us not forget the hole at the other end of the part.  We want
this hole to be on the same horizontal centreline as the slot.  If you
locate the circle carefully in your sketch, Pro/ENGINEER will `realise'
this, and automatically align it with the slot's centreline.
Select <B>Mouse Sketch</B> again, and use the MIDDLE mouse button to
sketch a circle of roughly the right diameter and in the desired location.
Dimension the circle so that, when regenerated, the overall sketch looks
like the following diagram:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/slot_sketch6.gif"><P>

When you select <B>Done</B> from the SKETCHER menu, Pro/ENGINEER asks you
whether to remove material from inside or outside the sketched regions.
A red arrow appears on the sketch to help you make this decision.
In this case, the proposed direction is not what you want, so select 
<B>Flip</B> from the DIRECTION menu.  Now when you select <B>Okay</B> 
from the DIRECTION menu, your slot and hole will be created!  To see this,
view the part in its default orientation again.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_sweep">A SWEPT HANDLE:</A></H3>

The `handle' of your bracket may be defined in terms of the volume swept
by a (circular) cross-section as it travels along (and remains normal to)
a curving path in space.  The path is called a <EM>trajectory</EM>, and
in this case it is planar.  More generally, the trajectory may follow a
3-dimensional curve, and the swept cross-section can have any planar shape.
The name for this kind of feature in Pro/ENGINEER is a <EM>sweep</EM>.<P>

The sequence of operations for creating a sweep is:
<UL>
<LI>define the trajectory;
<LI>define the cross-section.
</UL>

In this case, the trajectory lies in a plane which is different from any
existing datum plane, so the sketching plane will itself need to be
created.  This datum plane could be created as a distinct self-contained
feature.  However, because the swept handle is the only feature which will
make reference to this sketching plane, we will choose instead to create the
datum plane <EM>on the fly</EM>, as a `sub-feature' of the sweep feature.<P>

From the PART menu, select:<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid | Protrusion -&gt; Sweep | Solid
| Done -&gt; Sketch Traj | Done</B><P>

Then from the SETUP PLANE menu, select <B>Make Datum</B><P>

You then need to provide sufficient information to Pro/ENGINEER in order
to <EM>constrain</EM> the new datum plane.  In this case the task is
easy since you merely need to specify an offset plane, and so will need
only one constraint.<P>

From the DATUM PLANE menu, select: <B>Offset</B>, and then pick DTM2
on the graphics screen, and select <B>Enter Value</B> from the OFFSET menu.
Notice that a small green vector has appeared on the graphics window
defining a direction normal to DTM2, and that you are being prompted to
enter data in the message window.  Respond as follows:<P>

<KBD>Enter offset in the indicated direction, &lt;ESC&gt; to quit [7.86]:
<B>25 &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

The new datum plane is fully defined, so select <B>Done</B> as prompted.
To avoid ambiguity, Pro/ENGINEER now requires you to select the direction
for viewing the sketching plane.  Believe it or not, there is a small red
vector lurking somewhere on the screen, defining a direction normal to
DTM4.  The proposed direction is fine, so select <B>Okay</B>.  Finally you
must now specify the orientation of the sketching plane by nominating the
by-now-familiar horizontal or vertical reference plane.  (Try to predict
how the sketch plane will appear if you carry out the following step.)
Ensure that <B>Bottom</B> is highlighted in the SKET VIEW menu, and pick
datum plane DTM3 so that its yellow side will face down towards the
bottom of the sketch view screen.  (Was your prediction correct?)<P>

Begin your sketch of the trajectory with the three lines illustrated in
this diagram:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/handle_sketch1.gif"><P>

Next select (beginning from the SKETCHER menu) 
<B>Sketch -&gt; Arc -&gt; Fillet</B>, and pick first the left-hand
vertical sketched line (roughly halfway up the line), and then the
horizontal sketched line.  A fillet arc should appear.  Repeat this
process on the right-hand vertical line to obtain a second fillet.
Select <B>Alignment</B>, and align the lower end of each of the vertical
lines with DTM3.  Then add dimensions to achieve a regenerated sketch
like the one shown below:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/handle_sketch2.gif"><P>

Notice that Pro/ENGINEER puts a cyan vector at one end of the sketched 
trajectory to indicate the start point.  It is important to be aware of
this starting point and its corresponding vector, because when you come
to sketch the cross-section in a few moments' time, you will be `looking
along' this vector (i.e. the cross-sectional sketching plane will be
perpendicular to the trajectory's starting vector).<P>

Finalise the trajectory by regenerating and selecting <B>Done</B>.
When you then select an option from the SWEEP_OPT2 menu (select
<B>Free Ends | Done</B> ), Pro/ENGINEER will immediately present you
with another sketch view -- this time for sketching the cross-section.
As expected, the view is facing in the same direction as the starting
vector of the trajectory.  If you look carefully, you will see that there
is a pair of cyan cross-hairs marking the location of the starting vector.
(The vector itself can't be seen, because you are viewing it `end-on'.)
Your sketch view should look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/handle_sketch3.gif"><P>

You are now ready to sketch the cross-section of the sweeep.  This is just
a circle, centred on the cross-hairs.  Ensure that <B>Mouse Sketch</B> is
selected in the GEOMETRY menu, and sketch your circle (recall that you use
the MIDDLE mouse button for mouse-sketching circles).  When you dimension
and regenerate the circle in the usual fashion, (modifying its dimensions
and regenerating again), the result should be:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="BRACKET/handle_sketch4.gif"><P>

To finish the sweep feature, select <B>Done</B> from below the SKETCHER
menu.  You can see it in all its glory by viewing it in default orientation.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_welds">WELD FILLETS:</A></H3>

Your bracket is almost complete.  The final task is to place a `round' on
the two circular edges where the new handle joins the rest of the part.
From the FEAT menu, select:<P>

<B>Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Round -&gt; Edge | Constant |
Circular | No End Srf | Done</B><P>

You are now prompted to `<KBD>Specify edges to be rounded/filleted.</KBD>'
The edges you want to fillet are hidden by the short leg of the 
angle-section, so you must use `query select' to pick them.  Select
<B>Query Sel</B> and pick on one of the (hidden) edges.  When the desired
edge highlights in dark blue, check the statement in the message window,
and confirm by selecting <B>Accept</B>.<P>

Note that only half of the intersecting edge is highlighted.  This is
because Pro/ENGINEER represents complete cylinders as two equal halves,
so that the edges become two 180 degree arcs rather than one complete
circle.  When you are rounding the edges of cylinders, however, you only
need to select one of these edges.  The round will automatically wrap
around the entire cylinder.<P>

Pro/ENGINEER stays in `query select' mode, so you simply repeat the
process for the hidden edge at the other end of the handle.  When both
edges are highlighted, select <B>Done</B> from below the EDGE SEL menu,
and select <B>Enter</B> from the RADIUS VAL menu.  The the desired fillet
radius (6mm) as follows:<P>
<KBD>Enter RADIUS [0.8100]: <B>6</B></KBD><P>

The fillets now appear.  Well done!  You have finished modelling your first
real part in Pro/ENGINEER.  This may have seemed painful, but you have
in fact come an amazingly long way down the path of learning how to use
this software package.<P>

When you spin the image appropriately, and shade it, your bracket should
now look just like the one at the start of this document.  Check it out.

<H3><A NAME="purging">PURGING YOUR WORK:</A></H3>

If you have been saving your work regularly after each new feature is
added, you will now have many versions of the file <EM>bracket.prt</EM>
in your directory.  You can check the contents of the current directory
from within Pro/ENGINEER by selecting (from the MAIN menu)
<B>Misc -&gt; List Dir</B> and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the 
default directory being proposed in the message window.  Do it now ...<P>

For this exercise, you have no need of the out-dated versions of your
bracket.  To remove all except the latest version, select (again from
the MAIN menu) <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B> and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
to accept the default object being proposed in the message window.  Now 
if you list the contents of the current directory again, you
will see that all but the latest versions of <EM>bracket.prt</EM> have
been removed.<P>

It's a good idea to purge your models occasionally, since the old file
versions take up valuable disk space.  Purging is a handy way to avoid
exceeding your storage quota (a system issue, not directly related to
Pro/ENGINEER).

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION:</A></H3>

The instructions which follow describe the creation of a series of related
3D models.  These models correspond to the various body parts of a standard
LEGO person.  <EM>LEGO</EM> is a registered trademark of LEGO Australia
Pty Ltd.<P>

The LEGO person was chosen as a modelling subject because:

<UL>
<LI>it is likely to be familiar to many engineering students;
<LI>its shape is composed of a range of relatively simple geometrical
    primitives, but is sufficiently complex to maintain interest;
<LI>it is possible to <EM>lend</EM> (not donate!) each student a sample
    LEGO person for study and measurement during the class exercise;
<LI>some of the body parts are harder to model than others, so learners
    can progress through a range of degrees of difficulty;
<LI>the various body parts can be combined in Pro/ENGINEER into an
    assembly, giving insight into the hierarchy of features, parts, and
    assemblies.
</UL>

It is assumed that you have completed the `steel bracket' model
described in earlier notes, and have thereby become acquainted with some
basic feature-creation operations in Pro/ENGINEER.<P>

You are now invited to tackle the challenging task of devising your own
3D models.  Some help will be given along the way in these instructions,
but not in as much detail as before.  It is hoped that you will begin to
recognise familiar patterns of layout and activity in Pro/ENGINEER's
interface, and so become more independent and confident in your use of it.
Eventually you will become an experienced modeller, and 3D modelling will
become `second-nature' to you, but it will take some practice.<P>

This document  merely introduces the LEGO body parts.  Linked documents
contain more specific instructions for creating each part, and eventually
for assembling the entire LEGO person.  However we expect that few students,
if any, will finish all the parts within the allotted class time.  Some
keen people may wish to complete the modelling exercise later.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="how_much_detail">HOW MUCH DETAIL IS REQUIRED ?:</A></H3>

Even though the body parts of a LEGO person have <EM>relatively</EM> simple
basic shapes, each one of the parts would be very difficult for you to
model <EM>if you attempt to represent all geometrical details</EM>.  In
all cases, it is recommended that you make some simplifications to the
parts you are modelling.  Obviously, some judgement will be needed in
deciding how far to simplify, and the pictures in these notes are intended
to help you with this.  As a general rule, for example, don't put too many
rounds on your parts (even though just about every edge on a piece of LEGO
is rounded).

<H3><A NAME="assessment_note">A NOTE ABOUT ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

A few formal questions (for answering on paper) may be asked through
the course of these instruction.  Where these occur in a particular
instruction file, there will be a clear indication in the `Contents'
section at the beginning of that file, to alert you to the existence of
the questions.<P>

Mainly, however, the assessment of your work will be based on the models
which you create.  It is vital, therefore, that you <EM>SAVE YOUR WORK</EM>
as you proceed.  Remember to save each part whenever a new feature is
created, and keep a note of the names you give to the various parts.<P>

There will not be sufficient time for your tutor to assess your work in
class, so it will be necessary for you to submit a copy of each of your
model files into a specially created directory for later assessment.  This
directory is unique for each student: for example, a student whose login
name (i.e. the name of their DECR account) is `jsmith' should save his or
her final Pro/ENGINEER parts into the directory /home/common/me/jsmith.
Their `bracket' part should be saved as /home/common/me/jsmith/bracket, 
and similarly for each of the later parts created for this exercise.
The <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> command is used to achieve this.<P>

Only the final version of each of your parts should be submitted to the
special directory.  Note that in the case of parts created during the
first session (last week), you will need to <B>Search/Retr</B> these
from the relevant sub-directory within your home directory (normally
this will be the sub-directory you named `3D'), and then do a
<B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> from the MAIN menu to save it to the special
submission directory.<P>

Details of these arrangements for the submission of work for assessment 
are explained on a separate handout sheet.  Please read it carefully,
and ask your tutor for help if you have any difficulty submitting files.

<H3><A NAME="parts_summary">A SUMMARY OF THE LEGO BODY PARTS:</A></H3>

The body parts of the standard LEGO(tm) person may be summarised as:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="lego_head.html">the head
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_head.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_torso.html">the torso
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_torso.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_hips.html">the hips
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_hips.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_leg_r.html">the right leg
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_leg_r.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_leg_l.html">the left leg
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_leg_l.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_arms.html">the arms
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_arms.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_hand.html">the hand (two of them)
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_hand.gif"></A>
</OL>

It is recommended that you attempt modelling the body parts in the same
sequence as listed above, as this represents an increasing level of
difficulty.  Don't worry about the arms -- these have a very complex
shape, and it is not expected that any student should try to model them
(although you may want to have a look at the arm which we have created
for you).<P>

You can use the links on the mini-images above to go directly to the
instruction files for each part, or you can work through the files in
sequence by using the `forwards arrow' button, below (it looks like 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="fwd.gif">).<P>

Alternatively, if you get lost, you can always use the `Home' button at
the bottom of this Mosaic window to return to the original Home Page for 
exercise GE1, and use the links in the Instructions Directory there.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="mosaic_is">WHAT IS MOSAIC ?:</A></H3>

NCSA Mosaic is an information browser developed at the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.<P>

Mosaic is an Internet-based global hypermedia browser that allows you to
discover, retrieve, and display documents and data from all over the
Internet.<P>

Mosaic is part of the World Wide Web project, a distributed hypermedia
environment originated at CERN and collaborated upon by a large,
informal, and international design and development team. 
Mosaic helps you explore a huge and rapidly expanding universe of
information and gives you powerful new capabilities for interacting with
information.<P>

The term `global hypermedia' means that information located around the world
is interconnected in an environment that allows you to travel through the
information by clicking on hyperlinks -- terms, icons, or images in
documents that point to other, related documents or parts of documents.<P>

Any hyperlink can point to any document anywhere on the Internet.
For example, this little image contains a link to a larger image.<P>
Click (only <EM>once</EM>) on the icon to see its linked document ...  
<A HREF="http://www.mame.mu.oz.au/eng_design/GE1/GENERAL/rn_stimpy.gif">
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="garbage.gif"></A><P>

You can play with this stuff for hours.  Please don't do this today -- 
you have more important work to do!  Mosaic is just a tool.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="doc_structure">HOW ARE THESE INSTRUCTIONS ORGANISED ?:</A></H3>

Perhaps the structure of the on-line instructions for this exercise seems 
a bit mysterious to you.  It is really not that complicated!  Except for the
Home Page, all of the instruction files are organised in the same way.<P>

The Home Page is a very short file.  It contains links to all the other
files which make up the set of instructions for Computer Graphics Exercise
GE1.  You can get to the start of every other file from the Home Page.<P>

All other information for GE1 is organised as a set of <EM>documents</EM>
(or computer files), each of which is divided into several <EM>sections</EM>.
Each document begins with a prominent heading and a characteristic picture
to help you recognise the document.  Then there follows a `Contents:' section.
The Contents in any given document contains convenient links to all the
section headings within the same document, although you can always get to
those sections just by scrolling down the document window, using the Mosaic
scroll-bar.<P>

There is a link button at the end of each section which can take you back to
the beginning of the same document (so you can use the Contents links easily).
There is also a different link button at the end of each <EM>document</EM>
which enables you to jump to the next document in the series.  For
convenience, a similar link has been placed near the start of each document
to allow you to quickly `skip ahead' to the next document in the series (this
`Skip' link button looks like a horizontal green bar across the Mosaic window
-- you've probably seen it already).<P>

There are about ten separate documents in this entire series of instructions.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="how_it_works">A MINIMUM SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR TODAY:</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Underlined pieces of text are links.  They will take you to other parts
    of this series of instructions.
<LI>Sometimes links take you to new files, sometimes to a different place
    in the same file.  There will usually be text in or near the link to
    tell you where the link will take you.
    <A HREF="nowhere.html">This link will take you nowhere special.</A>
<LI>When you have used a link, its appearance changes (here the underline
    becomes dashed, and the colour changes from blue to purple -- yuk!).
<LI>You can move up or down in the same file by using the Scroll Bar along
    the right-hand side of this Mosaic window.
<LI>The button labeled `Back' at the lower left corner of this Mosaic
    window will take you back to the previous place from which you jumped.
<LI>The button labeled `Home' has been set up so that it will always take
    you back to the master Instructions Directory, called your `Home Page'.
    If you ever get `lost in hyperspace', you can always go back home.
<LI>At the end of each main section of each file, an icon-button has been
    provided so you can easily return to the start of the same file (where
    you can use the links in the Contents area to jump to another section
    of the same file if you want to).  Usually you will want to go keep
    working down the file rather than jumping back to the start, but these
    `Return' buttons are there just in case.
    They look like this: <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"> . . . but this one
    is just a picture.  Sorry!
<LI>At the end of every file there is another icon-button like this:
    <IMG SRC="fwd.gif">  These are to help you move quickly to
    the next file in the series without having to go via the Home Page.
    Again, they are just provided for your convenience.
<LI>It is recommended that you work through these documents in the 
    sequence presented, although you don't <EM>have</EM> to.  However, the
    instructions for Pro/ENGINEER parts will develop in a logical
    progression, so you might miss something if you hop about.

<H3><A NAME="many_windows">COPING WITH ALL THESE WINDOWS:</A></H3>

There are a lot of windows to think about in this exercise, aren't there?
If you have made it this far, then you are probably managing them OK.
Nevertheless, it might be helpful to summarise here what we will call the
`standard' arrangement of windows and icons on the screen.  We have found
this `standard' arrangement to be the most workable layout for doing
computer graphics exercise such as this one, where you need to use:
<UL>
<LI>the Pro/ENGINEER windows,
<LI>this Mosaic window,
<LI>and perhaps a UNIX shell window
</UL>
all at the same time.  Just as a reminder, the Pro/ENGINEER windows and menus
look generally like the following figure:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="pro_windows_1.gif"><P>
... except that with some windowing environments, the Close Box is in a
different location, as shown below:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="pro_windows_2.gif"><P>

The `standard' arrangement of the various kinds of windows and their closed
icons is as summarised in the following diagram.<P>
<IMG SRC="std_windows.gif"><P>

Try developing a working style in which you have the Pro/ENGINEER and Mosaic
windows open simultaneously, and the UNIX shell window closed, so that your
arrangement of windows and their closed icons looks like this:<P>
<IMG SRC="work_windows.gif"><P>

You can be reading from the Mosaic window, and close it temporarily whenever
you need unobstructed access to the Pro/ENGINEER windows.  If you need to
bring all the Pro/ENGINEER windows and menus to the front quickly, this can
be achieved by iconising and immediately re-opening its graphics window.

    <UL>
    <LI> datums (planes and axes);
    <LI> extruded, revolved and swept protrusions;
    <LI> extruded, revolved and swept cuts;
    <LI> rounds;
    <LI> shells;
    <LI> maybe some others (e.g. holes);
    </UL>
<LI>to give you the satisfaction and experience of creating your own simple
    parts and assemblies;

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="user_interfaces">USER INTERFACES FOR CAD SOFTWARE:</A></H3>

For computer software to be useful, you need to be able to tell it what you
want it to do.  A user interface is the means by which communication is
achieved between a computer program and you, its user.  Many CAD software
packages employ graphical user interfaces or command-line interfaces, or some
combination of both.  Graphical user interfaces are usually icon-based, and
have pull-down menus, dialogue boxes and various kinds of on-screen buttons. 
Command-line interfaces require the user to type commands as text in the
proper syntax.  Both systems have their advantages and their disadvantages,
their advocates and their detractors.<P>
By contrast, Pro/ENGINEER relies on a menu-based user interface, with the
occasional entry of data (text or dimensions) through the keyboard.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="menu_system">USING Pro/ENGINEER's MENU SYSTEM:</A></H3>

Pro/ENGINEER is driven largely by menu selections from its hierarchical
system of menus.  Each selection is made by using the left mouse button to
`select' a command which is listed in a menu.  These are not 'pull-down' menus 
-- instead, the appropriate menu(s) will appear on the screen in response to
selections from higher-level menus.  Usually the most likely menu for making
your next selection will be the one which Pro/ENGINEER places nearest to the
bottom of the screen, although you may override this and select from a
higher-level menu.  Unavailable choices on a menu are greyed out.  Sometimes
several command choices must be made on the one menu -- each currently
selected choice will be highlighted in red.  Many menus appear with the
default selection(s) already highlighted (in red).

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="notation_conventions">
    NOTATION CONVENTIONS FOR THESE INSTRUCTIONS:</A></H3>
In these instructions we will need to use a standard notation for describing
menu selections compactly.  The conventions are as follows.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="menu_titles"> Menu Titles</A></H4>
Menu titles such as PART and FEAT and ENTERPART are shown in uppercase
letters, but with no other special formatting.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="command_select"> Command Selection</A></H4>
Menu commands (i.e. the items listed in the menu) are shown in <B>Bold</B>
with their first letter capitalised (this is the same way that the
commands appear in the menu).  Examples are
<B>Regenerate</B> and <B>Done</B> and <B>Thru All</B>.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="command_strings"> Strings of commands</A></H4>
Command strings, which are a series of menu selections, are shown with
each item separated either by an arrow (designated by &quot;-&gt;&quot;,
without the quotes) or a pipe character (you know, a &quot;|&quot; vertical
bar, without the quotes).  The arrows indicate that you move from one menu
to another, while the pipe separates choices you make within the one menu.
A typical command string is:<P>
        <B>Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Cut -&gt; Extrude | Solid | Done -&gt;
	Single | Done -&gt; One Side -&gt; Thru All | Done</B>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="screen_picks"> Picking from the screen</A></H4>
In these notes, the word `pick' will be used exclusively to refer to 
cases where you point to an object on the Pro/ENGINEER graphics window,
and click on it (usually with the LEFT mouse button).  Pro/ENGINEER 
generally highlights such objects by changing their colour.


<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="kbd_entry"> Entry from the keyboard</A></H4>
Additional conventions are needed to handle data entry from the keyboard.
When you need to answer a computer prompt, these instructions will show the
prompt and your response as follows:<P>

<KBD>Prompt [default_value]: <B>user_entry</B></KBD><P>

For example:<P>
<KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0001]: <B>wheel &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

In the example above, the text
&quot;<KBD>Enter Part name [PRT001]:</KBD>&quot;
is the exact prompt from the computer (note that Pro/ENGINEER uses square
brackets &quot;[...]&quot; to indicate default responses), and the text  
&quot;<KBD>wheel</KBD>&quot;
(without the quotes) is your intended response.<P>

The characters &quot;&lt;CR&gt;&quot; stand for `carriage return', and they
mean `type the key marked [RETURN] (or [ENTER] on some keyboards)'.  The
notion of a `carriage return' dates from the era of mechanical typewriters!<P>

Variables for which the user must substitute a particular value are
shown in input text as italicised variable names, for example:
<VAR>filename</VAR>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="miscellaneous">OTHER ISSUES ...</A></H3>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4>Saving Your Work</H4>
Pro/ENGINEER does not automatically save your work, or even prompt you
to save it before Exiting.  Unless you consciously save your work at
suitable points in its development, your work will be lost when you
Exit Pro/ENGINEER.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4>An Educational Experiment</H4>
This is a very new exercise, and in some ways you are part of an
educational experiment.  Don't worry if you feel that your progress is
somewhat slow through the various tasks in these instructions.  You are
learning how to use a state-of-the-art 3D modelling system, and that is no
mean feat!  Feel free to use Pro/ENGINEER outside your usual class times
if you want to work further through these instructions (to finish the
LEGO person, for example).  But you don't have to spend more than the 
allotted four hours on it.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4>Access to Pro/ENGINEER</H4>
You may want to use Pro/ENGINEER at other times throughout your course.
Go for it!  Expertise developed on a system like this will certainly 
enhance your professional qualifications (and also make you very impatient
with the less powerful CAD packages you might have to use elsewhere!), so
we want to encourage you to use Pro/ENGINEER wherever it suits you.
Information on how to learn more about using the software is provided
at the conclusion of this instruction set.<P>

It is intended that Pro/ENGINEER will become widely accessible around the
University -- especially throughout the Faculty of Engineering.  DECR is
one of the main centres providing access.  However the University has
negotiated a site-licence for this software, so if your own department is
not currently running it, and you want to use it, why not have a word to
your friendly Head of Department and suggest that they participate?

<H3><A NAME="intro">PROBLEMS ?!? . . . WHAT PROBLEMS ?:</A></H3>

We have found that students encounter some common problems when attempting
this computer graphics exercise.  The purpose of this `trouble-shooting'
document is to provide an easily accessible place for you to find information
about these problems.  You can jump back to here (via the Home Page) whenever
you need help.<P>

The problems form a somewhat miscellaneous collection.  Browse them now so
you have some idea of the difficulties covered.

<H3><A NAME="mosaic">PROBLEMS READING THE MOSAIC INSTRUCTIONS:</A></H3>

<DL>

<DT>``I am lost.''
<DD>Push the button labeled `Home' at the bottom of the Mosaic window.  This
    will return you to a consistent starting point.  From there you can can
    jump easily to all other parts of the instructions.<P>

<DT>``How do I get rid of extra Mosaic windows ?''
<DD>Push the button labeled `Close Window'.  This actually quits the window,
    so the word `close' is a bit misleading, we think.<P>

<DT>``How do I quit out of Mosaic ?''
<DD>Push the button labeled `Close Window' in all open Mosaic windows.<P>

<DT>``The Mosaic window is the wrong size.''
<DD>Re-size it by locating the mouse pointer over a corner (or edge) of the
    Mosaic window, and using the left mouse-button to drag the window to be
    a different size.<P>

<DT>``The Mosaic window is in the wrong place.''
<DD>Move it to a different location by locating the mouse pointer over the
    title-bar of the Mosaic window, and using the left mouse-button to drag
    the window into a different location.<P>

<DT>``My Mosaic window is in the way.''
<DD>Instead of re-sizing or moving it, you could simply iconise the Mosaic
    window temporarily by clicking on the small close box in the title-bar.
    This is the box which contains either a small dot, or a small
    downwards-facing triangle.  The icon can be re-opened by double-clicking
    on it.<P>

<DT>``I have lost parts of the Mosaic window.''
<DD>Perhaps you have placed the window so that it is partly beyond the edges
    of the screen -- if so, drag the window to a place where you can see all
    four borders clearly.<P>
    Perhaps you have made the Mosaic window so small that some of the
    buttons along its lower edge are no longer visible.  If so, re-size the
    Mosaic window as described above.<P>

<DT>``Some of the images look like this ... <IMG SRC="nonexistent.gif.html">''
<DD>This is our fault, not yours.
    Either there is something wrong with the way the image has been set up,
    or we just haven't gotten around to creating the image yet.  One thing
    you can try is to press the `Reload' button at the bottom of the Mosaic
    window.  If this doesn't work, inform your tutor.

<H3><A NAME="unix">UNIX AND ACCOUNT PROBLEMS:</A></H3>

<DL>

<DT>``My password has expired.''
<DT>``I have forgotten my password.''
<DT>``I don't have a DECR account.''
<DD>We assume that, since you are reading these instructions at the computer,
    you don't have any of the above problems!  If somehow you do, then see
    one of the DECR staff (preferably the Duty Programmer).<P>

<DT>``There are heaps of files in my directory.''
<DD>Use sub-directories to group related files together, and to separate them
    from other files.  It is beyond the scope of these notes to teach you
    UNIX, but it's amazing what you can accomplish with a working knowledge
    of just a few UNIX commands.  Check out commands like <B>ls</B>, 
    <B>mkdir</B>, <B>cd</B>, <B>cp</B>, <B>mv</B>, <B>rm</B>.  Be careful
    of the last one, since it removes files from the disk.<P>

<DT>``I cannot find the file I saved earlier.''
<DD>Maybe you are looking in the wrong directory.  Is your current working
    directory the same as when you saved the file?  Use <B>cd</B> to `move
    around' the filesystem, and use <B>ls</B> to list the files contained
    in directories.<P>

<DT>``I accidentally removed a file which I now need.''
<DD>Hmmmm.  It's probably gone forever.  If you are lucky, the DECR staff
    might be able to restore yesterday's version from a backup tape.<P>

<DT>``My disk storage quota has been exceeded.''
<DD>You will need to remove some files from your directory.  Keep your
    directories tidy and clear of junk (i.e. unnecessary files).

<H3><A NAME="hardware">HARDWARE PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS:</A></H3>

<DL>

<DT>``What kind of workstation am I using ?''
<DD>If you are in a DECR laboratory, and are working at a colour workstation,
    chances are that you are using either a Silicon Graphics (SG) Indy, or
    a Sun SPARC 2.  The SG Indys have a blue box, the Suns have a grey box.
    The SG Indys have a slightly smaller screen than the Suns.<P>

<DT>``My Sun workstation seems very slow when I run Pro/ENGINEER.''
<DD>That's right!  Certain operations (e.g. spinning shaded images) happen
    very slowly on the Suns.  There is not much you can do about it, as
    the DECR Sun workstations are not optimised for high-speed graphics.
    It is possible that other people are remotely logged into your computer
    and slowing your work down, but you don't have much control over that.
    Try to avoid shaded images as much as possible.<P>

<DT>``My SG Indy workstation seems very slow when I run Pro/ENGINEER.''
<DD>Probably you are not logged into the SG Indy under the `xterm' option.
    The SG Indys are equipped with powerful graphics capabilities, and can
    run Pro/ENGINEER very effectively -- even when manipulating shaded
    images.  However in order to make use of these capabilities, you need
    to do two things:
    <UL>
    <LI>have a special `SG' account created for you by DECR staff.  At the
        moment, this privilege is restricted to first-year students doing
        Technology 2, or the CAD option in IDM;
    <LI>connect to the Indy using the `xterm' option at login time.
    </UL>
    It is worth logging out and in again if you have an `SG' account, as
    the graphics performance will improve greatly.<P>

<DT>``My workstation seems to be not responding -- can I switch it off ?''
<DD>No!  Never switch off any part of these workstations.  It is more than
likely that your Pro/ENGINEER session is prompting for some keyboard input,
anyway.

<DT>``How do I start Pro/ENGINEER in the background ?''
<DD>By typing `<B><KBD>proeng &</KBD></B>' (without quotes, and followed by
    a return) in a UNIX shell window.<P>

<DT>``I think I may have started Pro/ENGINEER twice!  How can I check ?''
<DD>The best way to check is to iconise (i.e. close) all windows.  There
should be only one Pro/ENGINEER icon visible on the screen.  If there are
more, open the Pro/ENGINEER sessions (by double-clicking the icon) one at
a time, and <B>Exit</B> (and confirm) all but the one you want to keep.<P>

<DT>``Where does Pro/ENGINEER save my models ?''
<DD>Pro/ENGINEER will save files into its current working directory, which
    is (initially) the directory you were in when you started Pro/ENGINEER.
    This is also the directory in which it looks for files.  For this reason
    it is a good idea to change to this directory (within UNIX) 
    <EM>before</EM> starting your Pro/ENGINEER session.

<DT>``Can I re-size the Pro/ENGINEER main graphics window ?''
<DD>Yes, but it's not recommended.<P>

<DT>``Is it safe to move the Pro/ENGINEER menus around ?''
<DD>No, it is a bad idea.  The menus are intended to cascade down the screen
    in a logical progression, and their clarity depends on their location
    on the screen.  You run the risk of confusion if you move the menus from
    their default locations.<P>

<DT>``How do I see more lines in the Pro/ENGINEER message window ?''
<DD>Click carefully on the border of the message window to bring it to the
    `front' of the screen (i.e. so that it appears in front of the graphics
    window).  You can scroll up the message window if you want to.  Return
    the graphics window to the front again by clicking on its title-bar.

<H4><A NAME="retrieving"> Retrieving saved models</A></H4>
<DL>

<DT>``How do I retrieve previously-saved models ?''
<DD>The easiest way to retrieve files is to use the <B>Search/Retr</B>
    facility.  This avoids the need to type anything!  If you accidentally
    select <B>Retrieve</B>, you can still bring up a menu of available
    objects to retrieve by typing a question mark (`?') in response to
    the prompt.<P> 

<DT>``What if I can't find the model I want in the current directory ?''
<DD>It is possible to navigate around the directory levels from within
    the <B>Search/Retr</B> facility of Pro/ENGINEER.  To `go up' the
    directory hierarchy, simply select <B>UP..</B> from the menu showing
    the contents of the searched directory.  To `go down', select the name
    of a sub-directory from the same menu (all sub-directories are
    shown with a leading slash `/').  Note that this navigation is for 
    single retrievals only -- the current working directory is unchanged.<P>

<DT>``Help!  The model I retrieved is missing some features ...''
<DD>This probably means that you didn't save the latest version of your
    model, so that the latest features were lost when you last exited
    Pro/ENGINEER.  Alternatively, you may have saved your model into more
    than one directory, so that you might be retrieving a version of the
    model which is not the most recent on disk (i.e. you started Pro/ENGINEER
    from a directory containing out-of-date files).  The best thing to do
    is to <B>Exit</B> Pro/ENGINEER without saving anything, and search your
    directories and sub-directories for the latest version of your part.

<H4><A NAME="focus"> Getting back to the PART menu</A></H4>
<DL>

<DT>``I seem to have lost the PART menu ! !''
<DD><I>Short answer:</I> use <B>Change Window</B> from the MAIN menu.<P>
    <I>Long Answer:</I>
    It is very common for students to get into a mode in which they can 
    see their part in the graphics window, but are unable to access the
    PART menu in order to work on the part.  This is called `losing focus',
    and occurs because you selected <B>Mode</B> from the MAIN menu while
    you had an active part on the screen.  When you do this, Pro/ENGINEER 
    thinks you want to work on a second model simultaneously with the 
    first, and so brings up the MODE menu.  In this way you can have
    several Pro/ENGINEER graphics windows on the screen, each containing a 
    different model (this can be very useful, but it is probably not what
    you want right now!).  To return `focus' to a particular part (e.g. 
    the one in the main graphics window), select <B>Change Window</B> from
    the MAIN menu, and pick on the window which you want to activate.
    The corresponding PART menu should then appear.<P>

<DT>``How do I get rid of an unwanted graphics window ?''
<DD>Select <B>Quit Window</B> from the MAIN menu, and pick on the window
    which you want to clear.  The part in that window will then disappear.
    Note that the part remains resident in Pro/ENGINEER's memory until
    you <B>Exit</B> completely from Pro/ENGINEER.  In the meantime, you
    can re-activate it by selecting <B>Mode -&gt; Part -&gt; Search/Retr
    -&gt; In Session</B>.

<H4><A NAME="orientation"> Orienting the sketching view</A></H4>
<DL>

<DT>``Why must I to provide a <EM>horizontal or vertical reference for
    sketching</EM> each time I want to sketch anything ?''
<DD>Think of the sketching plane as a sheet of paper which Pro/ENGINEER is
    going to present to you in the plane of the screen.  Pro/ENGINEER needs
    to know which way to orient the paper.  The way you tell it this 
    information is by choosing a <EM>reference plane</EM> (which must be
    perpendicular to the sketching plane), and nominating the direction
    which this reference plane will be facing (either to the <B>Top</B>, 
    the <B>Bottom</B>, the <B>Right</B>, or the <B>Left</B> of the screen)
    when the sketching plane is facing out towards you from the screen.<P>

<IMG SRC="ref_planes.gif"><P>

<DT>``What is meant by the <EM>direction</EM> of the reference plane ?''
<DD>For a datum plane, the direction is indicated by the vector pointing
    outwards from the yellow side of the datum plane.  For a solid face,
    the direction is that of the outward normal to the surface.

<H4><A NAME="sketcher"> Using the Sketcher</A></H4>
<DL>

<DT>``How do I start sketching with the mouse ?''
<DD>Select <B>Sketch -&gt; Mouse Sketch</B> from the SKETCHER menu.<P>

<DT>``Which buttons do what when <B>Mouse Sketch</B> is selected ?''
<DD>The LEFT mouse-button sketches a chain of lines (use MIDDLE button
    to exit line-creation).<P>
    The MIDDLE mouse-button sketches circles (use MIDDLE button again to
    finish the circle, and LEFT button to abort).<P>
    The RIGHT mouse-button sketches tangent arcs from the end-points of 
    existing lines or arcs (use RIGHT button again to finish the arc,
    and MIDDLE button to abort).<P>

<DT>``How do I create centrelines, and what are they for ?''
<DD>Select <B>Sketch -&gt; Line -&gt; Centreline</B>, starting from the
     SKETCHER menu.  The purpose of centrelines is to impose some form
     of symmetry or alignment on various elements of a sketch, so the
     term `centreline' should not be taken too literally.<P>

<DT>``What is an <EM>open section</EM> ?''
<DD>An open section has some lines (or arcs) whose ends are not connected
    to any other sketched geometry.<P>

<DT>``My sketched section looks closed, but Pro/ENGINEER says it is open.''
<DD>Either your sketch is too untidy so that some line ends were not 
    assumed to be connected to each other, or you have drawn some lines
    superimposed on other lines, so they look like a single line.<P>

<DT>``The screen looks messy after several items were deleted.  How can I
    clean it up ?''
<DD>From the MAIN menu, select <B>View -&gt; Regen View</B>.

<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART:</A></H3>

Using the instructions in this file, you will create a 3D computer model
of the Steel Bracket illustrated above.  This model will contain several
<EM>features</EM> (indeed, one of our aims is to clarify the notion of
what a `feature' is).  Even though there are many features, the entire
bracket is considered to be a single <EM>part</EM> since it is composed
of continuous material.<P>

The bracket is a fairly challenging part for a novice modeller, and may
take you some time to construct.  We estimate that you may need about
90 minutes (i.e. most of your first session).  An experienced user of
Pro/ENGINEER might take 5 minutes for the same task.  Don't be
disheartened by this -- your proficiency will rapidly increase!<P>

Start creating your Bracket part now.  If you still have the image of
the cylinder in the main graphics window, clear it by selecting
<B>Quit Window</B> from the MAIN menu.  Notice that when you do this,
the PART menu disappears to be replaced by the MODE window so that you
are ready to create a new part in the (now empty) graphics window.<P>

Now from the MODE menu, select <B>Part -&gt; Create</B><P>

Notice that you are being prompted in Pro/ENGINEER's message window.
In response to this you should type the name `bracket' (without quotes)
as the name of your new part. In standard notation:

<P><KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0002]: <B>bracket &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

When you do this, the text in the titlebar of the main graphics window
changes to <I><B>**********Pro/ENGINEER Part: BRACKET**********</B></I>,
signifying that this is now the name of the current part in the active
window.  Since Pro/ENGINEER can have several parts, assemblies and
drawings open simultaneously in multiple windows, the asterisks are used
to indicate the currently active window.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="datums">DATUM PLANES (the first feature):</A></H3>

For this bracket (and all remaining parts in this set of exercises), you
will begin by creating a set of default <EM>datum planes</EM>.  These
are reference planes for use in defining all later geometry of the part.
They are not solid objects, and they won't show up in shaded images of
the part -- think of them as representing invisible, infinite planes.<P>

From the PART menu, select 
<P><B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Datum -&gt; Plane -&gt; Default</B><P>

A set of three datum planes will appear on the screen.  Study the 
arrangement of these planes for a moment.  The following images may
help you see how the planes are positioned in relation to each other.
The image on the right shows the planes as if they were opaque.
<P>
<IMG SRC="datum_planes.gif"><P>

Note that datum planes are usually created singly <EM>except</EM>
where default datum planes are the first feature created in the part.
The three you see on the screen are actually three separate features.<P>

Datum planes in Pro/ENGINEER have two sides: a <EM>front side</EM>
and a <EM>rear side</EM>.  The front side of a datum plane is always
shown with a yellow border, whereas the rear side is shown with a red
border.  Clearly, you are looking at the front side of all three planes.
Arrows have been added to the figures above to indicate the directions in
which the front sides of the three datum planes are considered to face.
These directions are the outward normals to each plane.<P>

The following image illustrates the way front and rear sides of a datum
plane face in opposite directions ...

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_angle">EXTRUDED ANGLE SECTION:</A></H3>

You are now ready to create the first solid feature of the Bracket.  This
is generally chosen to be the major solid block from which the part will
be formed, and it should not contain too much geometrical detail.  For
the bracket, we will create this feature as a sharp-sided L-shaped
<EM>extruded protrusion</EM> (or extrusion, for short).  Pro/ENGINEER
uses the word `protrusion' to refer to a generalised blob of material.<P>

An extrusion is defined by
<UL>
<LI>first defining a sketching plane, then 
<LI>sketching the cross-sectional shape, and then
<LI>specifying how far this cross-section is to be extruded out from the
    plane in which the sketch has been made.
</UL>
<EM>By default, extrusions are always made towards the viewer</EM>
(i.e. out of the screen, when looking straight at the sketching plane).<P>

A general note may be helpful here concerning Pro/ENGINEER's default
menu selections.  Command menus will often appear on the screen with 
certain options already highlighted in red.  These are the default values,
and if they are suitable to you they do not need to be clicked again with
the mouse pointer (although that does no harm).  They can, of course, be
over-ridden by selecting different options on the menu, and they can be
re-selected if you change your mind.  In these notes, all the selections
required for building a given command string will be listed (both the 
defaults and those options which need to be actually clicked).<P>

From the FEAT menu, select
<P><B>Create -&gt; Solid | Protrusion -&gt; Extrude | Solid | Done -&gt; Single | Done -&gt; One Side | Blind | Done</B><P>

At this point you must define your sketching plane, so that Pro/ENGINEER
knows where to use your cross-sectional information.  You should see the
PRE_SKETCH and SETUP_PLANE and GET_SELECT menus on the screen (under the
MAIN menu, which is always present), and you are being requested to 
pick a sketching plane (... check the text in the message window). 
Using the LEFT mouse button, pick on DTM1 (datum plane no. 1) in the 
main graphics window, either by picking on its name or border.<P>

Notice the temporary arrow which now appears pointing out from DTM1, and read
the prompt in the Message Window.  Since the proposed direction of feature
creation is satisfactory, select <B>Okay</B> from the DIRECTION menu.<P>

There is one more step to take before you can start sketching.  Having
selected DTM1 as your sketching plane, you need to tell Pro/ENGINEER how to
orient this sketching plane on the screen (i.e. tell it `which way is up').
To do this, you must identify a plane that will be used as a horizontal or
vertical reference in the sketch view.  Such a reference plane must always
be perpendicular to the sketching plane.  In this case, since DTM1 will be
facing directly out from the screen, we could specify either that
<UL>
<LI>datum plane DTM2 shall face towards the <I>top</I> of the screen, or
<LI>datum plane DTM3 shall face towards the <I>left</I> of the screen,
</UL>
both of which are equivalent specifications.  From the SKET VIEW menu, select:
<P><B>Top</B><P>
and pick DTM2 (pick on its name or border using the LEFT mouse button).
This means that the yellow side of DTM2 will face towards the top of the
screen in the sketch view, and therefore that DTM2 will be the horizontal
reference for the section you are about to sketch.  In most cases it is best
to use one of the original three datum planes for this kind of reference.<P>

You have now given Pro/ENGINEER enough information to define a sketching
plane, so it presents you with the sketch view looking like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sketch_view_blank.gif"><P>

Your view will also have a grid of faint lines to aid sketching.
Notice the yellow and red sides of the `edge-on' planes DTM2 and DTM3.
Are they facing the directions you expected them to ?<P>

You will have been placed automatically into the
<B>Sketcher -&gt; Mouse Sketch</B> mode, so you can immediately start
sketching.  Using the LEFT mouse buttons (to create lines), sketch the
cross section exactly as shown below (the small numbers are intended as
a guide to your sequence of points).  Use the MIDDLE mouse button to
end line creation.  Be careful not to create tiny little line segments
accidentally, as these will cause problems when you try to dimension and
regenerate the sketch later.  If you do create such problem lines, try
to delete them using the <B>Delete -&gt; Delete Many -&gt; Pick Many</B>
options.

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="angle_sectn.gif"><P>

Now you must dimension your sketch.  Four dimensions are required to
define the shape of this section (i.e. the overall length, the overall
height, and the thicknesses of the vertical and horizontal arms).
Select <B>Dimension</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  Creation of the first
dimension is described in the following diagram. Create all four dimensions
in a similar fashion.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="angle_dim_first.gif"><P>

Finally you must align the section to the existing part (i.e. to the
existing datum planes).  Pro/ENGINEER needs to be told that you want the
right-most vertical line aligned with datum DTM3, and the lower horizontal
line aligned with datum DTM2.  Select <B>Alignment</B> from the SKETCHER
menu.  Then click once on the right-most vertical line and once on DTM3.
The message window should confirm that the two entities have been
`-- ALIGNED --'.  Similarly click once on the lower horizontal line and 
once on DTM2 to align them.<P>

You have given Pro/ENGINEER all the information needed for it to reconstruct
the section, so select <B>Regenerate</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  If all 
goes well, you will see an encouraging confirmation in the message window.
Furthermore Pro/ENGINEER will assign a value to each of the symbolic
dimensions, and place you immediately into <B>Modify</B> mode so that you
can adjust the dimensions as desired.<P>

Specify the following dimensions:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="angle_dim_all.gif"><P>
and select <B>Regenerate | Done</B> from the SKETCHER menu.  The cross
section is now complete, and you are being prompted to enter an extrusion
depth.  The desired value in this case is 300mm.

<P><KBD>Enter depth [216.51]: <B>300 &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

Congratulations!  Your part now contains four features, namely the 3
datum planes and a (new) extruded protrusion.  To obtain an isometric,
shaded view, select:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Orientation -&gt; Default</B><P>
and then:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Cosmetic -&gt; Shade -&gt; Display</B>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="saving">SAVING YOUR WORK:</A></H3>

This is a good time to save your bracket model.  From the MAIN menu, select:
<P><B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B><P>
... and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> (i.e. the [RETURN] key) to accept the
default object being offered for saving (see the prompt in the message
window).  Pro/ENGINEER confirms that the model has been stored to a file.
If you were to check the contents of your current working directory, you
would find that there is a new file there called <KBD>bracket.prt.1</KBD>
 -- the `<KBD>prt</KBD>' extension indicates that it is a <EM>part</EM> file,
and the `<KBD>.1</KBD>' suffix is a file version number.  Pro/ENGINEER
keeps all file versions unless explicitly instructed to delete out-dated
ones, so next time you save your part you will have two part files in the
directory (<KBD>bracket.prt.1</KBD> and <KBD>bracket.prt.2</KBD>), and so on.
This is generally a good thing, except that it generates large numbers of
files which can fill up the disk unless you occasionally purge them.
For the moment, go ahead and  save your model whenever you get to a useful
new stage in its development, and we will discuss purging later.<P>

It is also worth knowing that Pro/ENGINEER not only stores models on file,
it also lets them hang around in memory.  To demonstrate this, select 
<B>Quit Window</B> from the MAIN menu.  (Go on!  It's safe -- you just stored
it, didn't you?)  Now we will retrieve the part, not from disk, but from
Pro/ENGINEER's program memory.  From the MODE menu, select:<P>
<B>Part -&gt; Search/Retr</B><P>
The <B>Search/Retr</B> option is very useful, since it means you don't have
to remember any filenames or do any typing.  Notice that there are two
options in the lower half of the SELECT FILE menu:
<UL>
<LI><B>Current Dir</B> is the default, and searches the current directory;
<LI><B>In Session</B> searches program memory for every relevant object
    you have worked with in the current Pro/ENGINEER session.
</UL>

Select <B>In Session -&gt; BRACKET.PRT</B><P>
... and you should be back where you were a few minutes earlier.  Notice
that the cylinder part (PRT0001.PRT) was also available, even though you
quit that window ages ago.<P>

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_rounds">ROUNDED EDGES:</A></H3>

You will now put some rounded fillets on three edges of the extrusion,
to make it look more like a real piece of angle section.  This is easily
achieved with the Pro/ENGINEER `Round' feature.<P>

Starting from the PART menu, select the following command string.<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Round -&gt; Edge | Constant |
Circular | No End Srf | Done</B><P>

You are now prompted to `<KBD>Specify edges to be
rounded/filleted</KBD>' by picking edges from the graphics window with
the LEFT mouse button.  Pick the edges shown highlighted in blue in the
next diagram, and then select <B>Done</B> from below the EDGE SEL menu.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="edge_sel.gif"><P>

When prompted to specify a radius value option from the RADIUS
VAL menu, select <B>Enter</B> from that menu, and respond to the prompt
for a radius in the message window as follows:<P>
<KBD>Enter RADIUS [0.7500]: <B>8</B></KBD><P>

The fillets now appear.  Shade the image to see them better, i.e. select:<P>
<B>View -&gt; Cosmetic -&gt; Shade -&gt; Display</B><P>

Note that although there are three fillets, they all belong to only one
feature in your part.  They could have been created separately, but there
was no advantage in doing this, since they all had essentially the same
specification.  We could call this a `compound' feature.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_slot_hole">A SLOT AND A HOLE:</A></H3>

It is generally best not to work on a shaded image of a part when creating or
modifying features, so select <B>View -&gt; Regen View</B> to return to the
`Hidden Line' representation of your bracket. These instructions will also
assume that you are viewing the part in its default orientation.<P>

You will now create a slot and a hole in the 80mm-wide leg of the angle
section.  This will be another compound feature, since the hole and slot
will be created as a single <EM>cut</EM> feature (although they could
just as well be created separately).  Just as a protrusion is the most
general kind of `material addition' feature in Pro/ENGINEER, a cut is the
most general kind of `material removal' feature (much more general and
powerful, for example, than either the <EM>hole</EM> feature or the
<EM>slot</EM> feature of Pro/ENGINEER, which are almost never used).<P>

Similarly to the extrusion, a cut is defined by
<UL>
<LI>first defining a sketching plane, then
<LI>sketching the cross-sectional shape, and then
<LI>specifying how far this cross-section is to be extruded inwards
    (as if using a biscuit cutter) from the plane in which the sketch has
    been made.
</UL>
<EM>By default, cuts are always made away from the viewer</EM>
(i.e. into the screen, when looking straight at the sketching plane).
This is more-or-less the opposite to the case for an extrusion.<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Cut -&gt; Extrude | Solid |
Done -&gt; Single | Done -&gt; One Side | Thru All | Done</B><P>

Let's say we want to define the shape of the hole and slot by sketching
a cross-section on the <EM>underside</EM> of the part.  Now when you are
prompted to pick (or create) a sketching plane, an interesting problem
arises -- how do you point to regions of your model which lie behind
solid material?  We would like to be able to point to the underside of
the part without having to spin the view.  This is the sort of situation
where Pro/ENGINEER's `query select' facility comes in useful.  Select:
<P><B>Query Sel</B><P>
from the GET SELECT menu, and note the comment in the message window.

Pick a point on the screen directly on the (underside of) the longer leg
of the part.  Because the top surface of this part is the first solid
surface encountered by Pro/ENGINEER when it looks where you have picked,
it highlights the upper face (which is not the one you want).  But
notice that a CONFIRM menu has appeared under the GET SELECT menu, so 
that you can tell Pro/ENGINEER to continue looking for items `below the
surface'.  Select <B>Next</B> from the CONFIRM menu, and the next item
highlighted in red on the graphics window should be the one you want --
the underside of the part.  Select <B>Accept</B> from the CONFIRM menu.<P>

An arrow appears indicating a proposed direction for the creation of the
cut (i.e. upwards from the underside of the part into solid material).
This direction is fine, so select <B>Okay</B>.  Note that when you enter
sketcher mode, you will be looking in the direction of creation of the
cut (i.e. you will be looking directly at the lower surface of the part).<P>

When prompted to pick a horizontal or vertical reference plane for
sketching, ensure that <B>Bottom</B> is highlighted in the SKET VIEW menu,
and pick DTM3.  This means that the yellow side of datum plane 3 will be
made to face the bottom of the screen in sketch view.  As soon as you
do this, Pro/ENGINEER will take you into sketcher mode.  If you have 
carefully followed instructions, the screen will look like this: 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch1.gif"><P>

There are many ways to sketch a slot efficiently -- here is just one
suggestion.  Begin by mouse-sketching a horizontal line near the right-hand
end of your view of the part.  Then, from the GEOMETRY menu, select 
<B>Line -&gt; Centreline</B>, and sketch a horizontal centreline a little
below your first line.  The result should look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch2.gif"><P>

Now select <B>Mouse Sketch</B> again, and use the RIGHT mouse button
carefully to draw two tangent arcs from the ends of the first line. 
Try to locate the centres of these arcs on the centreline, as shown: 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch3.gif"><P>

Although your section is not yet complete, it is useful to partially
dimension and regenerate it, so that the geometrical constraints can be
`locked-in'.  This helps prevent a section becoming too confused and
complex.  Select <B>Dimension</B> again, and see if you can achieve
a regenerated sketch looking like the following:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch4.gif"><P>

Now, starting from the SKETCHER menu, select <B>Geom Tools -&gt; Mirror</B>
and in response to the prompt, pick the centreline you have already drawn.
You want to mirror all the entities in your sketch about this centreline, 
so select <B>All | Done</B> from the MIRROR menu.  Bingo!  You now have
a sketch of the full slot.  However, the dimensioning is a bit unorthodox
(slots are usually dimensioned across their full width), so delete the
11mm half-width dimension, and replace it with a new dimension between the
upper and lower horizontal lines.  Regenerate to obtain the following result:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch5.gif"><P>

Finally let us not forget the hole at the other end of the part.  We want
this hole to be on the same horizontal centreline as the slot.  If you
locate the circle carefully in your sketch, Pro/ENGINEER will `realise'
this, and automatically align it with the slot's centreline.
Select <B>Mouse Sketch</B> again, and use the MIDDLE mouse button to
sketch a circle of roughly the right diameter and in the desired location.
Dimension the circle so that, when regenerated, the overall sketch looks
like the following diagram:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="slot_sketch6.gif"><P>

When you select <B>Done</B> from the SKETCHER menu, Pro/ENGINEER asks you
whether to remove material from inside or outside the sketched regions.
A red arrow appears on the sketch to help you make this decision.
In this case, the proposed direction is not what you want, so select 
<B>Flip</B> from the DIRECTION menu.  Now when you select <B>Okay</B> 
from the DIRECTION menu, your slot and hole will be created!  To see this,
view the part in its default orientation again.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_sweep">A SWEPT HANDLE:</A></H3>

The `handle' of your bracket may be defined in terms of the volume swept
by a (circular) cross-section as it travels along (and remains normal to)
a curving path in space.  The path is called a <EM>trajectory</EM>, and
in this case it is planar.  More generally, the trajectory may follow a
3-dimensional curve, and the swept cross-section can have any planar shape.
The name for this kind of feature in Pro/ENGINEER is a <EM>sweep</EM>.<P>

The sequence of operations for creating a sweep is:
<UL>
<LI>define the trajectory;
<LI>define the cross-section.
</UL>

In this case, the trajectory lies in a plane which is different from any
existing datum plane, so the sketching plane will itself need to be
created.  This datum plane could be created as a distinct self-contained
feature.  However, because the swept handle is the only feature which will
make reference to this sketching plane, we will choose instead to create the
datum plane <EM>on the fly</EM>, as a `sub-feature' of the sweep feature.<P>

From the PART menu, select:<P>

<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Solid | Protrusion -&gt; Sweep | Solid
| Done -&gt; Sketch Traj | Done</B><P>

Then from the SETUP PLANE menu, select <B>Make Datum</B><P>

You then need to provide sufficient information to Pro/ENGINEER in order
to <EM>constrain</EM> the new datum plane.  In this case the task is
easy since you merely need to specify an offset plane, and so will need
only one constraint.<P>

From the DATUM PLANE menu, select: <B>Offset</B>, and then pick DTM2
on the graphics screen, and select <B>Enter Value</B> from the OFFSET menu.
Notice that a small green vector has appeared on the graphics window
defining a direction normal to DTM2, and that you are being prompted to
enter data in the message window.  Respond as follows:<P>

<KBD>Enter offset in the indicated direction, &lt;ESC&gt; to quit [7.86]:
<B>25 &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

The new datum plane is fully defined, so select <B>Done</B> as prompted.
To avoid ambiguity, Pro/ENGINEER now requires you to select the direction
for viewing the sketching plane.  Believe it or not, there is a small red
vector lurking somewhere on the screen, defining a direction normal to
DTM4.  The proposed direction is fine, so select <B>Okay</B>.  Finally you
must now specify the orientation of the sketching plane by nominating the
by-now-familiar horizontal or vertical reference plane.  (Try to predict
how the sketch plane will appear if you carry out the following step.)
Ensure that <B>Bottom</B> is highlighted in the SKET VIEW menu, and pick
datum plane DTM3 so that its yellow side will face down towards the
bottom of the sketch view screen.  (Was your prediction correct?)<P>

Begin your sketch of the trajectory with the three lines illustrated in
this diagram:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="handle_sketch1.gif"><P>

Next select (beginning from the SKETCHER menu) 
<B>Sketch -&gt; Arc -&gt; Fillet</B>, and pick first the left-hand
vertical sketched line (roughly halfway up the line), and then the
horizontal sketched line.  A fillet arc should appear.  Repeat this
process on the right-hand vertical line to obtain a second fillet.
Select <B>Alignment</B>, and align the lower end of each of the vertical
lines with DTM3.  Then add dimensions to achieve a regenerated sketch
like the one shown below:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="handle_sketch2.gif"><P>

Notice that Pro/ENGINEER puts a cyan vector at one end of the sketched 
trajectory to indicate the start point.  It is important to be aware of
this starting point and its corresponding vector, because when you come
to sketch the cross-section in a few moments' time, you will be `looking
along' this vector (i.e. the cross-sectional sketching plane will be
perpendicular to the trajectory's starting vector).<P>

Finalise the trajectory by regenerating and selecting <B>Done</B>.
When you then select an option from the SWEEP_OPT2 menu (select
<B>Free Ends | Done</B> ), Pro/ENGINEER will immediately present you
with another sketch view -- this time for sketching the cross-section.
As expected, the view is facing in the same direction as the starting
vector of the trajectory.  If you look carefully, you will see that there
is a pair of cyan cross-hairs marking the location of the starting vector.
(The vector itself can't be seen, because you are viewing it `end-on'.)
Your sketch view should look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="handle_sketch3.gif"><P>

You are now ready to sketch the cross-section of the sweeep.  This is just
a circle, centred on the cross-hairs.  Ensure that <B>Mouse Sketch</B> is
selected in the GEOMETRY menu, and sketch your circle (recall that you use
the MIDDLE mouse button for mouse-sketching circles).  When you dimension
and regenerate the circle in the usual fashion, (modifying its dimensions
and regenerating again), the result should be:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="handle_sketch4.gif"><P>

To finish the sweep feature, select <B>Done</B> from below the SKETCHER
menu.  You can see it in all its glory by viewing it in default orientation.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feat_welds">WELD FILLETS:</A></H3>

Your bracket is almost complete.  The final task is to place a `round' on
the two circular edges where the new handle joins the rest of the part.
From the FEAT menu, select:<P>

<B>Create -&gt; Solid -&gt; Round -&gt; Edge | Constant |
Circular | No End Srf | Done</B><P>

You are now prompted to `<KBD>Specify edges to be rounded/filleted.</KBD>'
The edges you want to fillet are hidden by the short leg of the 
angle-section, so you must use `query select' to pick them.  Select
<B>Query Sel</B> and pick on one of the (hidden) edges.  When the desired
edge highlights in dark blue, check the statement in the message window,
and confirm by selecting <B>Accept</B>.<P>

Note that only half of the intersecting edge is highlighted.  This is
because Pro/ENGINEER represents complete cylinders as two equal halves,
so that the edges become two 180 degree arcs rather than one complete
circle.  When you are rounding the edges of cylinders, however, you only
need to select one of these edges.  The round will automatically wrap
around the entire cylinder.<P>

Pro/ENGINEER stays in `query select' mode, so you simply repeat the
process for the hidden edge at the other end of the handle.  When both
edges are highlighted, select <B>Done</B> from below the EDGE SEL menu,
and select <B>Enter</B> from the RADIUS VAL menu.  The the desired fillet
radius (6mm) as follows:<P>
<KBD>Enter RADIUS [0.8100]: <B>6</B></KBD><P>

The fillets now appear.  Well done!  You have finished modelling your first
real part in Pro/ENGINEER.  This may have seemed painful, but you have
in fact come an amazingly long way down the path of learning how to use
this software package.<P>

When you spin the image appropriately, and shade it, your bracket should
now look just like the one at the start of this document.  Check it out.

<H3><A NAME="purging">PURGING YOUR WORK:</A></H3>

If you have been saving your work regularly after each new feature is
added, you will now have many versions of the file <EM>bracket.prt</EM>
in your directory.  You can check the contents of the current directory
from within Pro/ENGINEER by selecting (from the MAIN menu)
<B>Misc -&gt; List Dir</B> and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the 
default directory being proposed in the message window.  Do it now ...<P>

For this exercise, you have no need of the out-dated versions of your
bracket.  To remove all except the latest version, select (again from
the MAIN menu) <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B> and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
to accept the default object being proposed in the message window.  Now 
if you list the contents of the current directory again, you
will see that all but the latest versions of <EM>bracket.prt</EM> have
been removed.<P>

It's a good idea to purge your models occasionally, since the old file
versions take up valuable disk space.  Purging is a handy way to avoid
exceeding your storage quota (a system issue, not directly related to
Pro/ENGINEER).

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION:</A></H3>

The instructions which follow describe the creation of a series of related
3D models.  These models correspond to the various body parts of a standard
LEGO person.  <EM>LEGO</EM> is a registered trademark of LEGO Australia
Pty Ltd.<P>

The LEGO person was chosen as a modelling subject because:

<UL>
<LI>it is likely to be familiar to many engineering students;
<LI>its shape is composed of a range of relatively simple geometrical
    primitives, but is sufficiently complex to maintain interest;
<LI>it is possible to <EM>lend</EM> (not donate!) each student a sample
    LEGO person for study and measurement during the class exercise;
<LI>some of the body parts are harder to model than others, so learners
    can progress through a range of degrees of difficulty;
<LI>the various body parts can be combined in Pro/ENGINEER into an
    assembly, giving insight into the hierarchy of features, parts, and
    assemblies.
</UL>

It is assumed that you have completed the `steel bracket' model
described in earlier notes, and have thereby become acquainted with some
basic feature-creation operations in Pro/ENGINEER.<P>

You are now invited to tackle the challenging task of devising your own
3D models.  Some help will be given along the way in these instructions,
but not in as much detail as before.  It is hoped that you will begin to
recognise familiar patterns of layout and activity in Pro/ENGINEER's
interface, and so become more independent and confident in your use of it.
Eventually you will become an experienced modeller, and 3D modelling will
become `second-nature' to you, but it will take some practice.<P>

This document  merely introduces the LEGO body parts.  Linked documents
contain more specific instructions for creating each part, and eventually
for assembling the entire LEGO person.  However we expect that few students,
if any, will finish all the parts within the allotted class time.  Some
keen people may wish to complete the modelling exercise later.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="how_much_detail">HOW MUCH DETAIL IS REQUIRED ?:</A></H3>

Even though the body parts of a LEGO person have <EM>relatively</EM> simple
basic shapes, each one of the parts would be very difficult for you to
model <EM>if you attempt to represent all geometrical details</EM>.  In
all cases, it is recommended that you make some simplifications to the
parts you are modelling.  Obviously, some judgement will be needed in
deciding how far to simplify, and the pictures in these notes are intended
to help you with this.  As a general rule, for example, don't put too many
rounds on your parts (even though just about every edge on a piece of LEGO
is rounded).

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="assessment_note">A NOTE ABOUT ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

A few formal questions (for answering on paper) may be asked through
the course of these instruction.  Where these occur in a particular
instruction file, there will be a clear indication in the `Contents'
section at the beginning of that file, to alert you to the existence of
the questions.<P>

Mainly, however, the assessment of your work will be based on the models
which you create.  It is vital, therefore, that you <EM>SAVE YOUR WORK</EM>
as you proceed.  Remember to save each part whenever a new feature is
created, and keep a note of the names you give to the various parts.<P>

There will not be sufficient time for your tutor to assess your work in
class, so it will be necessary for you to submit a copy of each of your
model files into a specially created directory for later assessment.  This
directory is unique for each student: for example, a student whose login
name (i.e. the name of their DECR account) is `jsmith' should save his or
her final Pro/ENGINEER parts into the directory /home/common/me/jsmith.
Their `bracket' part should be saved as /home/common/me/jsmith/bracket, 
and similarly for each of the later parts created for this exercise.
The <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> command is used to achieve this.<P>

Only the final version of each of your parts should be submitted to the
special directory.  Note that in the case of parts created during the
first session (last week), you will need to <B>Search/Retr</B> these
from the relevant sub-directory within your home directory (normally
this will be the sub-directory you named `3D'), and then do a
<B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> from the MAIN menu to save it to the special
submission directory.<P>

Details of these arrangements for the submission of work for assessment 
are explained on a separate handout sheet.  Please read it carefully,
and ask your tutor for help if you have any difficulty submitting files.

<H3><A NAME="parts_summary">A SUMMARY OF THE LEGO BODY PARTS:</A></H3>

The body parts of the standard LEGO(tm) person may be summarised as:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="lego_head.html">the head
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_head.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_torso.html">the torso
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_torso.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_hips.html">the hips
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_hips.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_leg_r.html">the right leg
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_leg_r.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_leg_l.html">the left leg
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_leg_l.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_arms.html">the arms
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_arms.gif"></A>
<LI><A HREF="lego_hand.html">the hand (two of them)
                       <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="mini_hand.gif"></A>
</OL>

It is recommended that you attempt modelling the body parts in the same
sequence as listed above, as this represents an increasing level of
difficulty.  Don't worry about the arms -- these have a very complex
shape, and it is not expected that any student should try to model them
(although you may want to have a look at the arm which we have created
for you).<P>

You can use the links on the mini-images above to go directly to the
instruction files for each part, or you can work through the files in
sequence by using the `forwards arrow' button, below (it looks like 
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="fwd.gif">).<P>

Alternatively, if you get lost, you can always use the `Home' button at
the bottom of this Mosaic window to return to the original Home Page for 
exercise GE1, and use the links in the Instructions Directory there.

Before you begin this new part, ensure that you have saved any previous work
in the current Pro/ENGINEER session (by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B>
from the MAIN menu, and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the proposed
name).  This might also be a good time to get rid of all the out-dated 
versions of the part you have just finished, so that disk space is not wasted.  
If that part is still current, just select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B> from the
MAIN menu, and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the default.  The
<B>Purge</B> command is quite safe -- it leaves you with only the latest
version of your part file.<P>

If the previous part you were working on is to be submitted for
assessment, you should also save a copy of it to your special `submission'
directory by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> and typing in the full
pathname of your submission directory (refer to the handout sheet entitled 
<EM>Assessment of Work in Exercise GE1</EM> for more complete instructions
on how to do this).<P>

Then clear the graphics window by selecting <B>Quit Window</B> from the 
MAIN menu.  The MODE menu should appear beneath the MAIN menu.<P>

Start modelling your new part by selecting <B>Part</B> from the MODE menu.
Select <B>Create</B> from the ENTERPART menu, and give your part a name:
<P><KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0001]: <B>head &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART (the head):</A></H3>

Broadly speaking, the head of the LEGO person may be regarded as a simple
<EM>solid of revolution</EM>.  (This is certainly true if we ignore the
complication of the tiny `tri-star' inside its upper hole -- and it is
recommended that you ignore the tri-star for the purpose of this exercise.)
It is possible to create the head in Pro/ENGINEER with a single feature,
however to do so would be to break the cardinal rule of feature-based
modelling: <EM>`keep your features simple'</EM>.  Much better to have a
larger number of simple features, than a few very cumbersome features which
are difficult to sketch and modify.<P>

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feats_outline">BRIEF OUTLINE OF FEATURES FOR `head':</A></H3>

There are many ways to model the `head' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following set of features:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes</A>
<LI><A HREF="#revolved_protrusion">A Revolved Protrusion</A>
<LI><A HREF="#two_rounds">Rounds on the upper and lower edges</A>
<LI><A HREF="#bottom_hole">A large hole (Extruded Cut) in the base</A>
<LI><A HREF="#top_hole">A small hole (Coaxial Hole) in the top</A>
</UL>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes:</A></H4>
For any part of consequence, <EM>always</EM> begin by creating a set of
datum planes.  These can be used to reference other features, and can be
helpful for defining planes of symmetry.  It is generally better to use
datum planes in dimensioning and aligning your model, than to use the 
surfaces of solid features.  Using datum planes as references minimises
the risk of setting up unnecessary parent/child relationships between
features.<P>

Even though the head is such a simple axisymmetric part, it is still 
worthwhile starting with a set of datum planes.  If at some later stage 
you want to add a non-axisymmetric feature to the head (a face, say, or
perhaps the tri-star in the upper hole), then this will be much simpler
if a set of datum planes is already defined.<P>

You should remember how to do this.  Select:<P>
<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Datum -&gt; Plane -&gt; Default</B>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="revolved_protrusion">A Revolved Protrusion:</A></H4>
Most of the solid part of the head can be made with a single revolved
protrusion.  The three main cylindrical diameters can be incorporated
into this one feature.  You will need to examine the menu options and 
message text carefully on the screen in order to implement the following
instructions -- they will be expressed much less formally than before.<P>

From the FEAT menu, create a solid protrusion with a revolved form.
Choose the 360 degree option.  Accept the default values for other options.
Pick DTM1 as the sketching plane, accept the proposed viewing direction, 
and pick DTM2 to face the <B>Top</B> when choosing a horizontal reference
plane for orienting the sketching view.<P>

In the sketcher, sketch a closed section something like the one below:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="head_sec1.gif"><P>

The sketch contains one (vertical) centreline and eight ordinary lines.
Align the centreline to DTM3, and the lowest horizontal line to DTM2.
Add symbolic dimensions to the sketch until you think it is dimensioned
adequately, and then try to regenerate it.  If regeneration is not
successful, continue to add/delete dimensions, or align the sketch to the
datum planes, until the sketch does regenerate.  Then modify the values of
your sketch dimensions according to your measurements on a real LEGO head.
Regenerate the sketch after modification, and select <B>Done</B> when you
are satisfied with your section.  The revolved solid feature appears
immediately.  Save your part to protect your investment!

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="two_rounds">Rounds on the upper and lower edges:</A></H4>
Create a `round' on the upper and lower edges of the largest of the three
cylinders on your previous (revolved) feature.  Be aware that these rounds
on a real LEGO head have slightly different dimensions.  You can deal with
this either by placing two separate round features, each using the (default)
<B>Constant</B> option, or by creating a single <B>MultiConst</B> feature
which allows you to enter different radii for each edge selected.<P>

Note that you must select <B>Enter</B> from the RADIUS VAL menu in order
to enable entry of the radius values from the keyboard.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="bottom_hole">A large hole (Extruded Cut) in the base:</A></H4>
The most general way to remove material in Pro/ENGINEER is to use a `cut'.
We will use a cut here to make the large hole in the underside of the head,
even though a `hole' feature would serve just as well.<P>

Create a single solid extruded cut.  The cut will be `blind' (i.e. of a
specified depth), and extrude from one side of the sketching plane.
The intention is that you are going to sketch the circular cross-section of 
the hole, so when you are prompted to pick a sketching plane, which plane
are you going to choose?  Think about it, and give it a go ...  (you will
need to pick a second plane as a reference to help orient your sketch).<P>

Sketch, align, dimension, regenerate, modify, and regenerate your sketch
again until you are satisfied.  When you are done, type in the required
depth for the blind extrusion.  View and save your part.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="top_hole">A small hole (Coaxial Hole) in the top:</A></H4>
Just for variety, we will create the small hole through the top of the
head as a `coaxial hole'.  This is convenient, because the creation of the
previous feature (the large hole in the base) should have left us with
an axis with which to align the present hole.  It should be possible to
perform this entire hole creation while viewing the part in its default view,
so select the default view now.<P>

Create a solid hole feature.  It is to be a single, <B>Coaxial</B> hole,
which will extend through all geometry on one side of the selected surface.
Type in the required diameter, pick the axis for the hole, and pick the
surface in which the hole is to be made.  Your head part is now finished.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `head' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `head' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `head' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART (the torso):</A></H3>

The torso of a LEGO person has two planes of symmetry, and we will make use
of these when modelling the part in Pro/ENGINEER.  It is also helpful to
regard the torso as a solid block which has been `hollowed out' to leave an
outer shell of more-or-less constant shell thickness.  Observant students
will notice that even the cylindrical `neck' on top of the torso has been
hollowed out in this way.  Again, we will make use of this `shelled' 
characteristic when creating the Pro/ENGINEER model.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feats_outline">BRIEF OUTLINE OF FEATURES FOR `torso':</A></H3>

There are many ways to model the `torso' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following set of features:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes</A>
<LI><A HREF="#main_extrusion">A main trapezoidal block (Extrusion)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#neck_cylinder">A cylindrical neck (Extrusion)</A>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes:</A></H4>
As usual, begin by creating a default set of three datum planes.  Note that
these instructions will aim to apply a consistent orientation to these planes
in relation to the LEGO person.  In general, <EM>datum plane DTM1 will be
used as the vertical mid-plane which bisects the right side of the LEGO
person from its left side</EM>.  Furthermore, <EM>the front (yellow) side of
datum plane DTM3 will be taken as facing towards the front of the LEGO
person</EM>.  To help visualise and remember the orientation of these datum
planes, it might be helpful to make a sketch on paper of the default set of
datum planes as shown here, and keep the sketch handy.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="dtm_planes.gif">

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="main_extrusion">A main trapezoidal block (Extrusion):</A></H4>
The default option for various kinds of solid features is for them to be
created on <B>One Side</B> of a sketching plane.  However, it is often useful
to extrude a solid (protrusion or cut) an equal distance on <B>Both Sides</B>
of a sketching plane.  This enables us to exploit planes of symmetry in a
part more effectively.<P>

From the FEAT menu, create a single solid protrusion with an extruded form.
As a suggestion, make the extrusion to extend from <B>Both Sides</B> of the
sketching plane.  This will force the feature to be symmetrical about the
sketching plane.<P>

Pick DTM3 to be the sketching plane, and accept the default viewing
direction.  Make DTM1 to be a vertical reference for orienting the
sketching view, such that it faces to the <B>Right</B> of the screen.
In the sketcher, sketch a closed section something like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec1.gif"><P>

The above sketch illustrates a useful technique in Pro/ENGINEER:
<EM>exaggerate!</EM>  For example, there is no danger of the above sloping
lines being mistaken for vertical lines.  Exaggerated sketches help to create
unambiguous geometry for the Pro/ENGINEER Sketcher to solve.  Of course, once
the sketch is regenerated, the exact dimensions can be safely entered.<P>

Note that you will need to align your sketch to the existing datum planes
(for example, you might align the lower horizontal line with DTM2).  In the
example above, additional horizontal dimensions have been added to make the
section symmetrical about the vertical DTM1.  A more elegant sketching method
would be to sketch a vertical centreline to indicate this symmetry (aligning
the centreline with DTM1).  The additional dimensions (shown as `sd0' and
`sd2') would then be unnecessary.<P>

When you finally regenerate your section with the correct dimensions, select
<B>Done</B> and enter the overall extrusion depth to complete the extruded
solid feature.  Save the part.  Revert to the default view orientation.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="neck_cylinder">A cylindrical neck (Extrusion):</A></H4>

If the first solid feature was created on <B>Both Sides</B> of the sketching
plane, the result should look something like:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec2.gif"><P>

You now want to create the cylindrical `neck' which projects from the top of
the torso.  This feature will be another extrusion just like the last, except
that it will be extruded on only one side of its sketching plane.  To begin,
pick the uppermost solid surface of the part to define the sketching plane
(i.e. the one highlighted here in red):
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec3.gif"><P>

(Just for fun, see if you can predict how the sketching view will be oriented
before you pick the orientation reference.  Were you correct?)<P>

Go through the familiar sketching cycle:
<UL>
<LI>sketch the shape;
<LI>add symbolic dimensions (don't modify them yet);
<LI>align the section to the part;
<LI>attempt to regenerate, and add additional geometrical constraints
    (dimensions and alignments) if necessary;
<LI>continue in this manner until the sketch regenerates successfully;
<LI>then (and not before then!) modify dimensions to the desired values;
<LI>regenerate the sketch to incorporate the new dimensions;
<LI>select <B>Done</B> when the sketch is complete.
</UL>

Complete the feature by entering the desired extrusion distance.  The solid
cylinder is created towards you (i.e. out of the screen), as is always the
case for protrusions.  (Note: this is the opposite of `cut' features, which
are extruded away from the viewer, into the screen.)  Viewed again in its
default orientation, the part should now look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_neck.gif"><P>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="shell">A hollow outer Shell:</A></H4>

The torso of a LEGO person is approximately a hollow shell with a constant
wall thickness.  Fortunately, Pro/ENGINEER has a very powerful feature-type,
called a <EM>shell</EM>, for exactly this kind of shape.  A shell feature in
Pro/ENGINEER is defined by specifying:
<UL>
<LI>the `entry surfaces' on an existing solid (these are the surfaces which
    will be partially removed to form an opening into the new hollow interior
    of the solid); and
<LI>the wall thickness.  A different thickness can be defined for each
    exterior surface of the shell, if desired.
</UL>

From the PART menu, create a solid <B>Shell</B> feature on the torso.  The
entry to the shell will be from underneath (i.e. through the lower surface,
as seen on the previous sketch), so use <B>Query Sel</B> to pick the hidden
underside of your part, and select <B>Done Sel</B> to signal that you only
want the one entry surface.  Enter the desired wall thickness when prompted.
It is recommended that you use a constant wall thickness throughout this
shell, so just decline the opportunity to specify different wall thicknesses
by selecting <B>Done</B> from the SHELL EXIT menu.  Presto!  The torso is
immediately hollowed out.<P>

Notice that the hollow shell extends up into the cylindrical `neck' of the
torso (provided that you chose a wall thickness less than the neck radius).
Check to see whether this is what happens inside the neck protrusion on a
real LEGO person.  Think about what might be different if the torso were to
be shelled out <EM>before</EM> the neck protrusion was added.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="arm_holes">A pair of arm holes (Extruded Cut):</A></H4>

The torso contains two round holes to which the arms may be attached.  These
holes are in fact perpendicular to the sloping sides of the torso, and are
therefore exactly round.  For the sake of this exercise, however, the holes 
may be approximated by extruding a cut <EM>horizontally</EM> on both sides of
the central plane of symmetry (datum plane DTM1).  Think about what shape of
hole such a horizontal cylindrical cut will make in the sloping sides of the
torso...  In this case, the sloping sides are sufficiently close to being
vertical for such distortion to be neglected.<P>

Create a single solid <B>Cut</B>, extruded <B>Through All</B> material on
<B>Both Sides</B> of the central sketching plane (datum plane DTM1).  The
sketch for this cut will be a simple circle, with its centrepoint aligned to
the edge-view of datum plane DTM3.  When the cut is completed, notice how it
leaves a horizontal datum axis (probably called A_2) which is visible in the
default orientation.  Most features with a circular cross-section (whether
holes, round cuts or round extrusions) will leave visible axes such as this.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="edge_rounds">Rounds on the outer edges:</A></H4>

By now, your part will look something like:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_holes.gif"><P>

The next feature is optional, since (a) it is trivial to make, and (b) it
will substantially increase the size of your part file on disk.  However, it
will tend to give a `finished appearance' to your part.<P>

Create a single set of <B>Constant</B>-radius <B>Round</B> features on your
part.  The edges to be rounded should include the four edges of the upper
rectangle, and the four sloping edges.  The only difficulty will be picking
the edges which are `hidden' at the rear of your current view: you should use
<B>Query Sel</B> to pick those edges.  (HINT:  Always ensure you are viewing
a part in its default orientation when you are picking edges, as this avoids
ambiguity.  In fact, use the default orientation as much as possible.)<P>

Well done!  You have finished the LEGO person's torso.  Make sure you save
your part (select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> from the MAIN menu), and purge
the out-dated versions to save disk space (select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B>,
again from the MAIN menu).

<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `torso' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `torso' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `torso' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

The legs of a LEGO person have a surprisingly intricate internal shape, 
largely because they have been hollowed out to save plastic and to facilitate
the plastic moulding process.  For the sake of this exercise, you need not
represent all of the internal geometry in detail.<P>

Also note that the left leg and the right leg are mirror images of each
other.  We will exploit this symmetry when we create the second leg.  These
instructions assume that you are modelling the right leg first.

Before you begin this new part, ensure that you have saved any previous work
in the current Pro/ENGINEER session (by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B>
from the MAIN menu, and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the proposed
name).  This might also be a good time to get rid of all the out-dated 
versions of the part you have just finished, so that disk space is not wasted.  
If that part is still current, just select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B> from the
MAIN menu, and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the default.  The
<B>Purge</B> command is quite safe -- it leaves you with only the latest
version of your part file.<P>

If the previous part you were working on is to be submitted for
assessment, you should also save a copy of it to your special `submission'
directory by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> and typing in the full
pathname of your submission directory (refer to the handout sheet entitled 
<EM>Assessment of Work in Exercise GE1</EM> for more complete instructions
on how to do this).<P>

Then clear the graphics window by selecting <B>Quit Window</B> from the 
MAIN menu.  The MODE menu should appear beneath the MAIN menu.<P>

Start modelling your new part by selecting <B>Part</B> from the MODE menu.
Select <B>Create</B> from the ENTERPART menu, and give your part a name:
<P><KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0001]: <B>leg_l &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

Note that the left leg is a mirror image of the right leg.  We will therefore
take a short-cut in creating this second leg.  These instructions assume that
you have modelled the right leg first.

There are many ways to model the `leg_l' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following steps to derive the left leg's features from those
of the right:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#copy_part">Start with a copy of the first leg</A>
<LI><A HREF="#mirrored_copy">Mirror-copy all features (Independent)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#delete_original">Delete the original feature</A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `leg_l' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `leg_l' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `leg_l' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

The modelling of arms for a LEGO person is beyond the scope of this
exercise, since it requires the use of some of Pro/ENGINEER's more advanced
capabilities.  Nevertheless, you may be interested to retrieve a copy of 
some sample arm parts which we have created for you.  Assuming your earlier
models have been created using Pro/ENGINEER's `millimetre base unit' (which
will be true if you have copied the <KBD>config.pro</KBD> file correctly
into your home directory), then these arm parts should be compatible with
your own LEGO parts.<P>

There is of course no need to submit an `arm' part for assessment.<P>

Before you retrieve any new part, ensure that you have saved previous work
in the current Pro/ENGINEER session (by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B>
from the MAIN menu, and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the proposed
name).  This might also be a good time to get rid of all the out-dated 
versions of the part you have just finished, so that disk space is not
wasted.  If that part is still current, just select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B>
from the MAIN menu, and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the default. 
The <B>Purge</B> command is quite safe -- it leaves you with only the
latest version of your part file.<P>

If the previous part you were working on is to be submitted for
assessment, you should also save a copy of it to your special `submission'
directory by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> and typing in the full
pathname of your submission directory (refer to the handout sheet entitled 
<EM>Assessment of Work in Exercise GE1</EM> for more complete instructions
on how to do this).<P>

Then clear the graphics window by selecting <B>Quit Window</B> from the 
MAIN menu.  The MODE menu should appear beneath the MAIN menu.<P>

To retrieve a copy of the right arm, select <B>Part -$gt; Retrieve</B> from
the MODE menu, and type the following pathname into the message window:<P>

<KBD><B>/home/common/pro/arm_r &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

If desired, the left arm part can be retrieved by a similar process from:<P>

<KBD><B>/home/common/pro/arm_l &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

Exercise CG2 has provided a brief introduction to computer-based geometric
modelling. You have constructed a single part consisting of a number of
`features'.  The shape of the part was suggestive of a steel bracket -- the
sort which might be bolted to a wall to form a ladder rung.  In a sense,
though, the shape of the bracket was unimportant, as long as it possessed
a sufficiently interesting geometry to require several geometric features.

Before you begin this new part, ensure that you have saved any previous work
in the current Pro/ENGINEER session (by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B>
from the MAIN menu, and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the proposed
name).  This might also be a good time to get rid of all the out-dated 
versions of the part you have just finished, so that disk space is not wasted.  
If that part is still current, just select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B> from the
MAIN menu, and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the default.  The
<B>Purge</B> command is quite safe -- it leaves you with only the latest
version of your part file.<P>

If the previous part you were working on is to be submitted for
assessment, you should also save a copy of it to your special `submission'
directory by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> and typing in the full
pathname of your submission directory (refer to the handout sheet entitled 
<EM>Assessment of Work in Exercise GE1</EM> for more complete instructions
on how to do this).<P>

Then clear the graphics window by selecting <B>Quit Window</B> from the 
MAIN menu.  The MODE menu should appear beneath the MAIN menu.<P>

Start modelling your new part by selecting <B>Part</B> from the MODE menu.
Select <B>Create</B> from the ENTERPART menu, and give your part a name:
<P><KBD>Enter Part name [PRT0001]: <B>head &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART (the head):</A></H3>

Broadly speaking, the head of the LEGO person may be regarded as a simple
<EM>solid of revolution</EM>.  (This is certainly true if we ignore the
complication of the tiny `tri-star' inside its upper hole -- and it is
recommended that you ignore the tri-star for the purpose of this exercise.)
It is possible to create the head in Pro/ENGINEER with a single feature,
however to do so would be to break the cardinal rule of feature-based
modelling: <EM>`keep your features simple'</EM>.  Much better to have a
larger number of simple features, than a few very cumbersome features which
are difficult to sketch and modify.<P>

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feats_outline">BRIEF OUTLINE OF FEATURES FOR `head':</A></H3>

There are many ways to model the `head' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following set of features:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes</A>
<LI><A HREF="#revolved_protrusion">A Revolved Protrusion</A>
<LI><A HREF="#two_rounds">Rounds on the upper and lower edges</A>
<LI><A HREF="#bottom_hole">A large hole (Extruded Cut) in the base</A>
<LI><A HREF="#top_hole">A small hole (Coaxial Hole) in the top</A>
</UL>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes:</A></H4>
For any part of consequence, <EM>always</EM> begin by creating a set of
datum planes.  These can be used to reference other features, and can be
helpful for defining planes of symmetry.  It is generally better to use
datum planes in dimensioning and aligning your model, than to use the 
surfaces of solid features.  Using datum planes as references minimises
the risk of setting up unnecessary parent/child relationships between
features.<P>

Even though the head is such a simple axisymmetric part, it is still 
worthwhile starting with a set of datum planes.  If at some later stage 
you want to add a non-axisymmetric feature to the head (a face, say, or
perhaps the tri-star in the upper hole), then this will be much simpler
if a set of datum planes is already defined.<P>

You should remember how to do this.  Select:<P>
<B>Feature -&gt; Create -&gt; Datum -&gt; Plane -&gt; Default</B>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="revolved_protrusion">A Revolved Protrusion:</A></H4>
Most of the solid part of the head can be made with a single revolved
protrusion.  The three main cylindrical diameters can be incorporated
into this one feature.  You will need to examine the menu options and 
message text carefully on the screen in order to implement the following
instructions -- they will be expressed much less formally than before.<P>

From the FEAT menu, create a solid protrusion with a revolved form.
Choose the 360 degree option.  Accept the default values for other options.
Pick DTM1 as the sketching plane, accept the proposed viewing direction, 
and pick DTM2 to face the <B>Top</B> when choosing a horizontal reference
plane for orienting the sketching view.<P>

In the sketcher, sketch a closed section something like the one below:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="head_sec1.gif"><P>

The sketch contains one (vertical) centreline and eight ordinary lines.
Align the centreline to DTM3, and the lowest horizontal line to DTM2.
Add symbolic dimensions to the sketch until you think it is dimensioned
adequately, and then try to regenerate it.  If regeneration is not
successful, continue to add/delete dimensions, or align the sketch to the
datum planes, until the sketch does regenerate.  Then modify the values of
your sketch dimensions according to your measurements on a real LEGO head.
Regenerate the sketch after modification, and select <B>Done</B> when you
are satisfied with your section.  The revolved solid feature appears
immediately.  Save your part to protect your investment!

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="two_rounds">Rounds on the upper and lower edges:</A></H4>
Create a `round' on the upper and lower edges of the largest of the three
cylinders on your previous (revolved) feature.  Be aware that these rounds
on a real LEGO head have slightly different dimensions.  You can deal with
this either by placing two separate round features, each using the (default)
<B>Constant</B> option, or by creating a single <B>MultiConst</B> feature
which allows you to enter different radii for each edge selected.<P>

Note that you must select <B>Enter</B> from the RADIUS VAL menu in order
to enable entry of the radius values from the keyboard.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="bottom_hole">A large hole (Extruded Cut) in the base:</A></H4>
The most general way to remove material in Pro/ENGINEER is to use a `cut'.
We will use a cut here to make the large hole in the underside of the head,
even though a `hole' feature would serve just as well.<P>

Create a single solid extruded cut.  The cut will be `blind' (i.e. of a
specified depth), and extrude from one side of the sketching plane.
The intention is that you are going to sketch the circular cross-section of 
the hole, so when you are prompted to pick a sketching plane, which plane
are you going to choose?  Think about it, and give it a go ...  (you will
need to pick a second plane as a reference to help orient your sketch).<P>

Sketch, align, dimension, regenerate, modify, and regenerate your sketch
again until you are satisfied.  When you are done, type in the required
depth for the blind extrusion.  View and save your part.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="top_hole">A small hole (Coaxial Hole) in the top:</A></H4>
Just for variety, we will create the small hole through the top of the
head as a `coaxial hole'.  This is convenient, because the creation of the
previous feature (the large hole in the base) should have left us with
an axis with which to align the present hole.  It should be possible to
perform this entire hole creation while viewing the part in its default view,
so select the default view now.<P>

Create a solid hole feature.  It is to be a single, <B>Coaxial</B> hole,
which will extend through all geometry on one side of the selected surface.
Type in the required diameter, pick the axis for the hole, and pick the
surface in which the hole is to be made.  Your head part is now finished.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `head' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `head' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `head' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

<H3><A NAME="oview">OVERVIEW OF THIS PART (the torso):</A></H3>

The torso of a LEGO person has two planes of symmetry, and we will make use
of these when modelling the part in Pro/ENGINEER.  It is also helpful to
regard the torso as a solid block which has been `hollowed out' to leave an
outer shell of more-or-less constant shell thickness.  Observant students
will notice that even the cylindrical `neck' on top of the torso has been
hollowed out in this way.  Again, we will make use of this `shelled' 
characteristic when creating the Pro/ENGINEER model.

<P><A HREF="#start">Return to Contents at the start of this document ? <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="back.gif"></A>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="feats_outline">BRIEF OUTLINE OF FEATURES FOR `torso':</A></H3>

There are many ways to model the `torso' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following set of features:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes</A>
<LI><A HREF="#main_extrusion">A main trapezoidal block (Extrusion)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#neck_cylinder">A cylindrical neck (Extrusion)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#shell">A hollow outer Shell</A>
<LI><A HREF="#arm_holes">A pair of arm holes (Extruded Cut)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#edge_rounds">Rounds on the outer edges</A>
</UL>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="datum_planes">A default set of Datum Planes:</A></H4>
As usual, begin by creating a default set of three datum planes.  Note that
these instructions will aim to apply a consistent orientation to these planes
in relation to the LEGO person.  In general, <EM>datum plane DTM1 will be
used as the vertical mid-plane which bisects the right side of the LEGO
person from its left side</EM>.  Furthermore, <EM>the front (yellow) side of
datum plane DTM3 will be taken as facing towards the front of the LEGO
person</EM>.  To help visualise and remember the orientation of these datum
planes, it might be helpful to make a sketch on paper of the default set of
datum planes as shown here, and keep the sketch handy.
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="dtm_planes.gif">

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="main_extrusion">A main trapezoidal block (Extrusion):</A></H4>
The default option for various kinds of solid features is for them to be
created on <B>One Side</B> of a sketching plane.  However, it is often useful
to extrude a solid (protrusion or cut) an equal distance on <B>Both Sides</B>
of a sketching plane.  This enables us to exploit planes of symmetry in a
part more effectively.<P>

From the FEAT menu, create a single solid protrusion with an extruded form.
As a suggestion, make the extrusion to extend from <B>Both Sides</B> of the
sketching plane.  This will force the feature to be symmetrical about the
sketching plane.<P>

Pick DTM3 to be the sketching plane, and accept the default viewing
direction.  Make DTM1 to be a vertical reference for orienting the
sketching view, such that it faces to the <B>Right</B> of the screen.
In the sketcher, sketch a closed section something like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec1.gif"><P>

The above sketch illustrates a useful technique in Pro/ENGINEER:
<EM>exaggerate!</EM>  For example, there is no danger of the above sloping
lines being mistaken for vertical lines.  Exaggerated sketches help to create
unambiguous geometry for the Pro/ENGINEER Sketcher to solve.  Of course, once
the sketch is regenerated, the exact dimensions can be safely entered.<P>

Note that you will need to align your sketch to the existing datum planes
(for example, you might align the lower horizontal line with DTM2).  In the
example above, additional horizontal dimensions have been added to make the
section symmetrical about the vertical DTM1.  A more elegant sketching method
would be to sketch a vertical centreline to indicate this symmetry (aligning
the centreline with DTM1).  The additional dimensions (shown as `sd0' and
`sd2') would then be unnecessary.<P>

When you finally regenerate your section with the correct dimensions, select
<B>Done</B> and enter the overall extrusion depth to complete the extruded
solid feature.  Save the part.  Revert to the default view orientation.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="neck_cylinder">A cylindrical neck (Extrusion):</A></H4>

If the first solid feature was created on <B>Both Sides</B> of the sketching
plane, the result should look something like:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec2.gif"><P>

You now want to create the cylindrical `neck' which projects from the top of
the torso.  This feature will be another extrusion just like the last, except
that it will be extruded on only one side of its sketching plane.  To begin,
pick the uppermost solid surface of the part to define the sketching plane
(i.e. the one highlighted here in red):
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_sec3.gif"><P>

(Just for fun, see if you can predict how the sketching view will be oriented
before you pick the orientation reference.  Were you correct?)<P>

Go through the familiar sketching cycle:
<UL>
<LI>sketch the shape;
<LI>add symbolic dimensions (don't modify them yet);
<LI>align the section to the part;
<LI>attempt to regenerate, and add additional geometrical constraints
    (dimensions and alignments) if necessary;
<LI>continue in this manner until the sketch regenerates successfully;
<LI>then (and not before then!) modify dimensions to the desired values;
<LI>regenerate the sketch to incorporate the new dimensions;
<LI>select <B>Done</B> when the sketch is complete.
</UL>

Complete the feature by entering the desired extrusion distance.  The solid
cylinder is created towards you (i.e. out of the screen), as is always the
case for protrusions.  (Note: this is the opposite of `cut' features, which
are extruded away from the viewer, into the screen.)  Viewed again in its
default orientation, the part should now look like this:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_neck.gif"><P>

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="shell">A hollow outer Shell:</A></H4>

The torso of a LEGO person is approximately a hollow shell with a constant
wall thickness.  Fortunately, Pro/ENGINEER has a very powerful feature-type,
called a <EM>shell</EM>, for exactly this kind of shape.  A shell feature in
Pro/ENGINEER is defined by specifying:
<UL>
<LI>the `entry surfaces' on an existing solid (these are the surfaces which
    will be partially removed to form an opening into the new hollow interior
    of the solid); and
<LI>the wall thickness.  A different thickness can be defined for each
    exterior surface of the shell, if desired.
</UL>

From the PART menu, create a solid <B>Shell</B> feature on the torso.  The
entry to the shell will be from underneath (i.e. through the lower surface,
as seen on the previous sketch), so use <B>Query Sel</B> to pick the hidden
underside of your part, and select <B>Done Sel</B> to signal that you only
want the one entry surface.  Enter the desired wall thickness when prompted.
It is recommended that you use a constant wall thickness throughout this
shell, so just decline the opportunity to specify different wall thicknesses
by selecting <B>Done</B> from the SHELL EXIT menu.  Presto!  The torso is
immediately hollowed out.<P>

Notice that the hollow shell extends up into the cylindrical `neck' of the
torso (provided that you chose a wall thickness less than the neck radius).
Check to see whether this is what happens inside the neck protrusion on a
real LEGO person.  Think about what might be different if the torso were to
be shelled out <EM>before</EM> the neck protrusion was added.

<!-- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -->
<H4><A NAME="arm_holes">A pair of arm holes (Extruded Cut):</A></H4>

The torso contains two round holes to which the arms may be attached.  These
holes are in fact perpendicular to the sloping sides of the torso, and are
therefore exactly round.  For the sake of this exercise, however, the holes 
may be approximated by extruding a cut <EM>horizontally</EM> on both sides of
the central plane of symmetry (datum plane DTM1).  Think about what shape of
hole such a horizontal cylindrical cut will make in the sloping sides of the
torso...  In this case, the sloping sides are sufficiently close to being
vertical for such distortion to be neglected.<P>

Create a single solid <B>Cut</B>, extruded <B>Through All</B> material on
<B>Both Sides</B> of the central sketching plane (datum plane DTM1).  The
sketch for this cut will be a simple circle, with its centrepoint aligned to
the edge-view of datum plane DTM3.  When the cut is completed, notice how it
leaves a horizontal datum axis (probably called A_2) which is visible in the
default orientation.  Most features with a circular cross-section (whether
holes, round cuts or round extrusions) will leave visible axes such as this.

<H4><A NAME="edge_rounds">Rounds on the outer edges:</A></H4>

By now, your part will look something like:
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="torso_holes.gif"><P>

The next feature is optional, since (a) it is trivial to make, and (b) it
will substantially increase the size of your part file on disk.  However, it
will tend to give a `finished appearance' to your part.<P>

Create a single set of <B>Constant</B>-radius <B>Round</B> features on your
part.  The edges to be rounded should include the four edges of the upper
rectangle, and the four sloping edges.  The only difficulty will be picking
the edges which are `hidden' at the rear of your current view: you should use
<B>Query Sel</B> to pick those edges.  (HINT:  Always ensure you are viewing
a part in its default orientation when you are picking edges, as this avoids
ambiguity.  In fact, use the default orientation as much as possible.)<P>

Well done!  You have finished the LEGO person's torso.  Make sure you save
your part (select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> from the MAIN menu), and purge
the out-dated versions to save disk space (select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B>,
again from the MAIN menu).

<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `torso' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `torso' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `torso' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

The legs of a LEGO person have a surprisingly intricate internal shape, 
largely because they have been hollowed out to save plastic and to facilitate
the plastic moulding process.  For the sake of this exercise, you need not
represent all of the internal geometry in detail.<P>

Also note that the left leg and the right leg are mirror images of each
other.  We will exploit this symmetry when we create the second leg.  These
instructions assume that you are modelling the right leg first.

take a short-cut in creating this second leg.  These instructions assume that
you have modelled the right leg first.

There are many ways to model the `leg_l' part.  One suggested approach is
to use the following steps to derive the left leg's features from those
of the right:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#copy_part">Start with a copy of the first leg</A>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="submit">SUBMITTING THIS PART FOR ASSESSMENT:</A></H3>

When you have modelled your `leg_l' part as far as you intend, you should
submit it for assessment by your tutor.  To do this, you must save a copy
of it to the special directory which has been set up for you in the common
area of the computer's filesystem.  This directory has the same name as your
login name.  For example, if your login name is `jsmith', then you must save
the part to the directory named <KBD>/home/common/me/ge1/jsmith</KBD>.<P>

If you have finished your `leg_l' part for the time being, submit it for
assessment now by following these instructions (you can always re-submit
it again later if you improve your part).  Beginning from the MAIN menu,
select <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B>.  You will be prompted for the name of a
directory into which Pro/ENGINEER will save a copy of your part (the
default offered will be your current working directory).  In response to
the prompt, type:
<P><KBD>Which directory ? [...]: <B>/home/common/me/ge1/</B></KBD><I>yourname</I><KBD><B> &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>
... of course replacing `<I>yourname</I>' with your own login name.<P>

Ensure that the object to be saved is the `leg_l' (it should be the default
offered in the message window -- if so, then just type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B>
at the prompt).  You will see a reassuring comment if Pro/ENGINEER can
successfully store your part in the desired location.  If not, then please
<EM>consult your tutor</EM>.

The modelling of arms for a LEGO person is beyond the scope of this
exercise, since it requires the use of some of Pro/ENGINEER's more advanced
capabilities.  Nevertheless, you may be interested to retrieve a copy of 
some sample arm parts which we have created for you.  Assuming your earlier
models have been created using Pro/ENGINEER's `millimetre base unit' (which
will be true if you have copied the <KBD>config.pro</KBD> file correctly
into your home directory), then these arm parts should be compatible with
your own LEGO parts.<P>

There is of course no need to submit an `arm' part for assessment.<P>

Before you retrieve any new part, ensure that you have saved previous work
in the current Pro/ENGINEER session (by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Save</B>
from the MAIN menu, and typing a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the proposed
name).  This might also be a good time to get rid of all the out-dated 
versions of the part you have just finished, so that disk space is not
wasted.  If that part is still current, just select <B>Dbms -&gt; Purge</B>
from the MAIN menu, and type a <B>&lt;CR&gt;</B> to accept the default. 
The <B>Purge</B> command is quite safe -- it leaves you with only the
latest version of your part file.<P>

If the previous part you were working on is to be submitted for
assessment, you should also save a copy of it to your special `submission'
directory by selecting <B>Dbms -&gt; Backup</B> and typing in the full
pathname of your submission directory (refer to the handout sheet entitled 
<EM>Assessment of Work in Exercise GE1</EM> for more complete instructions
on how to do this).<P>

Then clear the graphics window by selecting <B>Quit Window</B> from the 
MAIN menu.  The MODE menu should appear beneath the MAIN menu.<P>

To retrieve a copy of the right arm, select <B>Part -$gt; Retrieve</B> from
the MODE menu, and type the following pathname into the message window:<P>

<KBD><B>/home/common/pro/arm_r &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

If desired, the left arm part can be retrieved by a similar process from:<P>

<KBD><B>/home/common/pro/arm_l &lt;CR&gt;</B></KBD><P>

<P>
Most languages let you create procedures or functions, or both.
C allows only functions, although you can create procedures by
making functions that return nothing. C functions can accept an
unlimited number of parameters. As mentioned in the introduction,
they cannot be nested. In general, C does not care in what order
you put your functions in the program.
<P>
We have already talked a little about functions. The <B>rand 
</B>function in tutorial 4 is about as simple as a function can
get. It accepts no parameters and returns an integer result: 
<PRE>
int rand() 
/* from K&amp;R - produces a random number between 0 and 32767.*/ 
{ 
    rand_seed = rand_seed * 1103515245 +12345; 
    return (unsigned int)(rand_seed / 65536) % 32768; 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>int rand()</B> line declares the function rand to the rest
of the program and specifies that rand will accept no parameters
and return an integer result. This function has no local variables,
but if it needed locals, they would go right below the opening
<B>{</B>. (C actually allows you to declare variables after any
<B>{</B>. Those variables vanish as soon as the matching <B>}
</B> is reached. While they exist, they are placed on the system
stack.) Note that there is no <B>;</B> after the <B>()</B> in
the first line. If you accidentally put one in, you will get a
huge cascade of error messages that make no sense. Also note that
even though there are no parameters, you must use the <B>()</B>.
They tell the compiler that you are declaring a function rather
than simply declaring an int.
<P>
The <B>return</B> statement is important to any function that
returns a result. It gives the function the value to return and
causes it to exit immediately. This means that you can place multiple
return statements in the function to give it multiple exit points.
If you do not place a return statement in a function, the function
returns when it reaches <B>}</B> and gives you garbage (many compilers
will warn you if you fail to return a value). In C, a function
can return values of any type.
<P>
There are several correct ways to call the <B>rand</B> function---for
example: <B>x=rand();</B>. The <B>x</B> is assigned the value
returned by rand in this statement. Note that you <I>must</I>
use <B>()</B> in the function call, even though no parameter is
passed. Otherwise, <B>x</B> is given the memory address of the
rand function, which is generally not what you intended.
<P>
You might also call rand this way: 
<PRE>
if (rand() &gt; 100) 
</PRE>

<P>
Or this way: 
<PRE>
rand(); 
</PRE>

<P>
In the latter case, the value returned by rand is discarded. You
may never want to do this with rand, but many functions return
some kind of error code through the function name, and if you
are not concerned with the error code (for example, because you
know that an error is impossible) you can discard it in this way.
<P>
You create procedures (in the Pascal sense) by giving the function
a void return type. For example: 
<PRE>
void print_header()  
{     
    printf(&quot;Program Number 1\n&quot;);     
    printf(&quot;by Marshall Brain\n&quot;);     
    printf(&quot;Version 1.0, released 12/26/91\n&quot;);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This function returns no value, so it is a procedure. You can
call it with the following statement: 
<PRE>
print_header(); 
</PRE>

<P>
You must include <B>()</B> in the call. If you do not, the function
is not called, even though it will compile correctly on many systems.
<P>
C functions can accept parameters of any type. For example: 
<PRE>
int fact(int i)  
{    
    int j,k; 
    
    j=1; 
    for (k=2; k&lt;=i; k++) 
        j=j*k;    
    return j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
returns the factorial of <B>i</B>, which is passed in as an integer
parameter. Separate multiple parameters with commas: 
<PRE>
int add (int i, int j)  
{    
    return i+j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
C has evolved over the years. You will frequently see functions
such as add written in the &quot;old style,&quot; as shown below:

<PRE>
int add(i,j)  
    int i;  
    int j;  
{    
    return i+j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
It is important to be able to read code written in the older style.
There is no difference in the way it executes; it is just a different
notation. You should use the &quot;new style,&quot; (known as
&quot;ANSI C&quot;) with the type declared as part of the parameter
list, unless you know you will be shipping the code to someone
who has access only to an &quot;old style&quot; (non-ANSI) compiler.
<P>
It is now considered good form to use <B>function prototypes</B>
for all functions in your program. A prototype declares the function
name, its parameters, and its return type to the rest of the program
in a manner similar to a <B>forward</B> declaration in Pascal.
To understand why function prototypes are useful, enter the following
code and run it: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,add(3));  
} 
 
int add(int i, int j)  
{    
    return i+j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code compiles without giving you a warning, even though 
<B>add</B> expects two parameters but receives only one, because
C does not check for parameter matching either in type or count.
You can waste an enormous amount of time debugging code in which
you are simply passing one too many or too few parameters. The
above code compiles properly, but it produces the wrong answer.
<P>
To solve this problem, C lets you place function prototypes at
the beginning of (actually, anywhere in) a program. If you do
so, C checks the types and counts of all parameter lists. Try
compiling the following: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
int add (int,int); /* function prototype for add */ 
 
void main()  
{    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,add(3));  
} 
 
int add(int i, int j)  
{    
    return i+j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The prototype causes the compiler to flag an error on the <B>printf
</B> statement.
<P>
Place one prototype for each function at the beginning of your
program. They can save you a great deal of debugging time, and
they also solve the problem you get when you compile with functions
that you use before they are declared. For example, the following
code will not compile: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,add(3));  
} 
 
float add(int i, int j)  
{    
    return i+j;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Why, you might ask, will it compile when add returns an int but
not when it returns a float? Because C defaults to an int return
value. Using a prototype will solve this problem. &quot;Old style&quot;
(non-ANSI) compilers allow prototypes, but the parameter list
for the prototype must be empty. Old style compilers do no error
checking on parameter lists.<HR>

<HR>

<P>
In this section, you will create a small program that generates
10 random numbers and sorts them.
<P>
Start an editor and enter the following code: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
#define MAX 10 
 
int a[MAX]; 
int rand_seed=10; 
 
int rand() /* from K&amp;R - returns random number between 0 and 32767.*/  
{ 
    rand_seed = rand_seed * 1103515245 +12345;    
    return (unsigned int)(rand_seed / 65536) % 32768;  
} 
 
void main()  
{    
    int i,t,x,y; 
  
    /* fill array */    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)    
    {      
        a[i]=rand();      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]);    
    } 
  
    /* more stuff will go here in a minute */ 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code contains several new concepts, although the lines <B>#include
</B> and <B>#define</B> should be familiar to you. The line <B>int
a[MAX];</B> shows you how to declare an array of integers in C.
As an example, the declaration <B>int a[10];</B> is declared like
this in Pascal: 
<PRE>
a:array [0..9] of integer; 
</PRE>

<P>
All arrays start at index zero and go to n-1 in C. Thus, <B>int
a[10];</B> contains 10 elements, and the largest valid index is
9. Unlike Pascal, C offers no way to change the range of index
values. Also note that because of the position of the array <B>a
</B>, it is global to the entire program.
<P>
The line <B>int rand_seed=10</B> also declares a global variable,
this time named <B>rand_seed</B>. that is initialized to 10 each
time the program begins. This value is the starting seed for the
random number code that follows. In a real random number generator,
the seed should initialize as a random value, such as the system
time. Here, the <B>rand</B> function will produce the same values
each time you run the program.
<P>
The line <B>int rand()</B> is a function declaration. The equivalent
function declaration looks like this in Pascal: 
<PRE>
function rand:integer; 
</PRE>

<P>
The rand function accepts no parameters and returns an integer
value.
<P>
The four lines that follow implement the <B>rand</B> function.
We will ignore them for now.
<P>
The main function is normal. Four local integers are declared,
and the array is filled with 10 random values using a <B>for</B>
loop. Note that arrays are indexed exactly as they are in Pascal.
<P>
Now add the following code in place of the <B>more stuff ...</B>
comment: 
<PRE>
/* bubble sort the array */    
for (x=0; x &lt; MAX-1; x++)      
    for (y=0; y &lt; MAX-x-1; y++)        
        if (a[y] &gt; a[y+1])        
        {  
            t=a[y];  
            a[y]=a[y+1];  
            a[y+1]=t;        
        } 
/* print sorted array */    
printf(&quot;--------------------\n&quot;);    
for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)      
printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]); 
</PRE>

<P>
This code sorts the random values and prints them in sorted order.
<H5>Exercises</H5>

<OL>
<LI>In the first piece of code, try changing the for loop that
fills the array to a single line of code. Make sure that the result
is the same as the original code.
<LI>Take the bubble sort code out and put it into its own function.
(See tutorial 6, if necessary.) The function header will be <B>void
bubble_sort</B>. Then move the variables used by the bubble sort
to the function as well and make them local there. Because the
array is global, you do not need to pass parameters.
<LI>Initialize the random number seed to different values.
</OL>

<H5>C Errors to avoid</H5>

<OL>
<LI>C has no range checking, so if you index past the end of the
array, it will not tell you about it. It will eventually crash
or give you garbage data.
<LI>A function call must include (even if no parameters are passed.
For example, C will accept <B>x=rand;</B>, but the call will not
work. The memory address of the rand function will be placed into
<B>x</B>. You must say <B>x=rand();</B>.

<HR>

<P>
Text files in C are straightforward and easy to understand. They
work the same way as Pascal text files. All text file functions
and types in C come from the <B>stdio</B> library.
<P>
When you need text I/O in a C program, and you need only one source
for input information and one sink for output information, you
can rely on stdin (standard in) and stdout (standard out). You
can then use input and output redirection at the command line
to move different information streams through the program. There
are six different I/O commands in &lt;stdio.h&gt; that you can
use with stdin and stdout: 
<PRE>
printf	prints formatted output to stdout
scanf	reads formatted input from stdin
puts	prints a string to stdout
gets	reads a string from stdin
putc	prints a character to stdout
getc, getchar	reads a character from stdin
</PRE>

<P>
The advantage of stdin and stdout is that they are easy to use.
Likewise, the ability to redirect I/O is very powerful. For example,
maybe you want to create a program that reads from stdin and counts
the number of characters: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  
#include &lt;string.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    char s[1000];    
    int count=0;     
     while (gets(s))      
        count += strlen(s);    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,count);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Enter this code and run it. It waits for input from stdin, so
type a few lines. When you are done, press CTRL-D to signal end-of-file
(eof). gets reads a line until it detects eof, then returns a
0 so that the while loop ends. When you press CTRL-D, you see
a count of the number of characters in stdout (the screen).
<P>
Now, suppose you want to count the characters in a file. If you
compiled the program to <B>a.out</B>, you can type the following:

<PRE>
a.out &lt; filename 
</PRE>

<P>
Instead of accepting input from the keyboard, the contents of
the file named <B>filename</B> will be used instead. You can achieve
the same result using pipes: 
<PRE>
cat &lt; filename | a.out 
</PRE>

<P>
You can also redirect the output to a file: 
<PRE>
a.out &lt; filename &gt; out 
</PRE>

<P>
This command places the character count produced by the program
in a text file named <B>out</B>.
<P>
Sometimes, you need to use a text file directly. For example,
you might need to open a specific file name and read from or write
to it. You might want to manage several streams of input or output
or create a program like a text editor that can save and recall
data or configuration files on command. 
<PRE>
fopen	opens a text file
fclose	closes a text file
feof	detects end-of-file marker in a file
fprintf	prints formatted output to a file
fscanf	reads formatted input from a file
fputs	prints a string to a file
fgets	reads a string from a file
fputc	prints a character to a file
fgetc	reads a character from a file
</PRE>

<P>
You use <B>fopen</B> like <B>reset</B> and <B>rewrite</B> in Pascal.
It opens a file for a specified mode (the three most common are
r, w, and a, for read, write, and append). It then returns a file
pointer that you use to access the file. For example, suppose
you want to open a file and write the numbers 1 to 10 in it. You
could use the following code: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#define MAX 10 
void main()  
{    
    FILE *f;    
    int x; 
     f=fopen(&quot;out&quot;,&quot;w&quot;);    
    for(x=1; x&lt;=MAX; x++)      
        fprintf(f,&quot;%d\n&quot;,x); 
    fclose(f); 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>fopen</B> statement here opens a file named <B>out</B>
with the w mode. This is a destructive write mode, which means
that if <B>out</B> does not exist it is created, but if it does
exist it is destroyed and a new file is created in its place.
The fopen command returns a pointer to the file, which is stored
in the variable f. This variable is used to refer to the file.
If the file cannot be opened for some reason, f will contain NULL.
<P>
The fprintf statement should look very familiar: It is just like
printf but uses the file pointer as its first parameter. The fclose
statement closes the file when you are done.
<P>
To read a file, open it with r mode. In general, it is not a good
idea to use <B>fscanf </B>for reading: Unless the file is perfectly
formatted, fscanf will not handle it correctly. Instead, use 
<B>fgets</B> to read in each line and then parse out the pieces
you need.
<P>
The following code demonstrates the process of reading a file
and dumping its contents to the screen: 
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    FILE *f;    
    char s[1000]; 
    
    f=fopen(&quot;infile&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);    
    while (fgets(s,1000,f)!=NULL)      
        printf(&quot;%s&quot;,s);    
    fclose(f);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The fgets statement returns a NULL value at the end-of-file marker.
It reads a line (up to 1,000 characters in this case) and then
prints it to stdout. Notice that the printf statement does not
include \n in the format string, because fgets adds \n to the
end of each line it reads. Thus, you can tell if a line is not
complete in the event that it overflows the maximum line length
specified in the second parameter to fgets.
<P>
C Errors to Avoid:
<UL>
<LI>Do not accidentally type <B>close</B> instead of <B>fclose
</B>. The close function exists, so the compiler accepts it. It
will even appear to work if the program only opens or closes a
few files. However, if the program opens and closes a file in
a loop, it will eventually run out of available file handles and/or
memory space and crash, because <B>close</B> is not closing the
files correctly.

If statements and while loops in C both rely on the idea of <B>Boolean
expressions</B>, as they do in Pascal. In C, however, there is
no Boolean type: You use plain integers instead. The integer value
0 in C is false, while any other integer value is true.
<P>
Here is a simple translation from Pascal to C. First, the Pascal
code:
<PRE>
if (x=y) and (j&gt;k) then     
    z:=1  
else    
    q:=10; 
</PRE>

<P>
The C translation looks very similar, but there are some important
differences, which we will discuss next.
<PRE>
if ((x==y) &amp;&amp; (j&gt;k))    
    z=1;  
else    
    q=10; 
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that <B>=</B> in Pascal became <B>==</B> in C. This is
a very important difference, because C will accept a single <B>=
</B> when you compile, but will behave differently when you run
the program. The <B>and</B> in Pascal becomes <B>&amp;&amp;</B>
in C. Also note that <B>z=1;</B> in C has a semicolon, that C
drops the <B>then</B>, and that the Boolean expression must be
completely surrounded by parentheses.
<P>
The following chart shows the translation of all boolean operators
from Pascal to C: 
<PRE>
Pascal C
=      ==
&lt;      &lt;
&gt;      &gt;
&lt;=     &lt;=
&gt;=     &gt;=
&lt;&gt;     !=
and    &amp;&amp;
or     ||
not    ! 
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>==</B> sign is a problem because every now and then you
may forget and type just <B>=</B>. Because integers replace Booleans,
the following is legal in C:
<PRE>
void main()  
{    
    int a; 
    
    printf(&quot;Enter a number:&quot;);    
    scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,a);    
    if (a)    
    {      
        blah blah blah    
    }  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
if <B>a</B> is anything other than 0, the code that <B>blah blah
blah</B> represents gets executed. Suppose you take the following
Pascal statement: 
<PRE>
if a=b then 
</PRE>

<P>
and incorrectly translate it to C as:
<PRE>
if (a=b)  /* it SHOULD be &quot;if (a==b)&quot; */ 
</PRE>

<P>
In C, this statement means &quot;Assign b to a, and then test
a for its Boolean value.&quot; So if <B>a</B> becomes 0, the 
<B>if</B> statement is false; otherwise, it is true. The value
of a changes as well. This is not the intended behavior (although
this feature is useful when used correctly), so be careful with
your <B>=</B> and <B>==</B> conversions.
<P>
<B>While</B> statements are just as eay to translate. For example,
the following Pascal code:
<PRE>
while a &lt; b do  
begin    
    blah blah blah  
end; 
</PRE>

<P>
in C becomes:
<PRE>
while (a &lt; b)  
{    
    blah blah blah  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
C also provides a "do-while" structure to replace Pascal's "repeat-until,"
as shown below:
<PRE>
do  
{    
    blah blah blah  
}  
while (a &lt; b); 
</PRE>

<P>
The for loop in C is somewhat different from a Pascal for loop,
because the C version is simply a shorthand way of expressing
a while statement. For example, suppose you have the following
code in C:
<PRE>
x=1;  
while (x&lt;10)  
{    
    blah blah blah    
    x++; /* x++ is the same as saying x=x+1. It's an increment. */  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
You can convert this into a for loop as follows:
<PRE>
for(x=1; x&lt;10; x++)  
{    
    blah blah blah  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the while loop contains an initialization step (<B>x=1
</B>), a test step (<B>x&lt;10</B>), and an increment step (x++
</B>). The for loop lets you put all three parts onto one line,
but you can put anything into those three parts. For example,
suppose you have the following loop:
<PRE>
a=1;  
b=6;  
while (a &lt; b)  
{    
    a++;    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
You can place this into a for statement as well:
<PRE>
for (a=1,b=6; a &lt; b; a++,printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a)); 
</PRE>

<P>
It is confusing, but it is possible. The comma operator lets you
separate several different statements in the initialization and
increment sections of the for loop (but not in the test section).
Many C programmers like to pack a lot of information into a single
line of C code. I think it makes the code harder to understand,
so I break it up.
<H5>C Errors to avoid</H5>

<OL>
<LI>Putting = when you mean == in an if or while statement.
<LI>Accidentally putting a ; at the end of a for loop or if statement,
so that the statement has no effect. For example,
</OL>

<PRE>
for (x=1; x&lt;10; x++);    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,x); 
</PRE>

<B>for</B> statement.<HR>

Version 2.0, 2/14/95
</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>
These tutorials are excerpted from the book <A HREF = "../../books/motifb.htm" >"Motif Programming: The Essentials and More" 
</A> , by Marshall Brain.
</ADDRESS>
<HR>

<P>
Pointers are used everywhere in C, and if you have a good understanding
of them C should not pose a problem. If, however, you have never
seen pointers before, or feel uncomfortable with them, you may
want to read an extra book or two, or talk to someone who already
understands them. C pointers are basically the same as Pascal
pointers except they are used much more freely in C.
<P>
C uses pointers in three main ways. First, they are used to create
<I>dynamic data structures</I>: data structures built up from
blocks of memory allocated from the heap at run-time. This is
the only visible way that Pascal uses pointers. Second, C uses
pointers to handle <I>variable parameters</I> passed to functions.
And third, pointers in C provide an alternative means of accessing
information stored in arrays, which is especially valuable when
you work with strings (see tutorial 13). There is an intimate
link between arrays and pointers in C.
<P>
In many cases, C programmers use pointers because they make the
code slightly more efficient. Sometimes, however, they simply
seem to make the code harder to understand. Once you have mastered
the three uses of pointers in C, however, you &quot;know&quot;
C for all practical purposes.
<H3>Pointer Basics</H3>

<P>
A normal variable is a location in memory that can hold a value.
For example, when you declare a variable <B>i </B>as an integer,
four bytes of memory are set aside for it. In your program, you
refer to that location in memory by the name<B> i</B>. At the
machine level, that location has a memory address, at which the
four bytes can hold one integer value.
<P>
A pointer is a variable that points to another variable. This
means that it holds the memory address of another variable. Put
another way, the pointer does not hold a value in the traditional
sense; instead, it holds the address of another variable. It points
to that other variable by holding its address.
<P>
Because a pointer holds an address rather than a value, it has
two parts. The pointer itself holds the address. That address
points to a value. There is the pointer and the value pointed
to. This fact can be a little confusing until you get used to
it.
<P>
The following example code shows a typical pointer:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    int i,j;    
    int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */ 
     p = &amp;i;    
    *p=5;    
    j=i;    
    printf(&quot;%d %d %d\n&quot;,i,j,*p);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The line <B>int *p</B> declares a pointer. It asks the compiler
to declare a variable <B>p</B> that is a pointer to an integer.
The <B>*</B> indicates that a pointer is being declared rather
than a normal variable. You can create a pointer to anything:
a float, a structure, a char, and so on.
<P>
The line <B>p = &amp;i;</B> will definitely be new to you. In
C, <B>&amp;</B> is called the <B>address operator</B>. The expression
<B>&amp;i</B> means ``the memory address of the variable <B>i
</B>.&quot; Thus, the expression <B>p = &amp;i;</B> means &quot;Assign
to <B>p</B> the address of <B>i</B>.&quot; Once you execute this
statement, <B>p</B> points to <B>i</B>. Before you do so, <B>p
</B> contains a random, unknown address, and its use will likely
cause a segmentation fault.
<P>
After the line <B>p = &amp;I;</B>, <B>p</B> points to <B>I</B>.
Once <B>p</B> points to <B>i</B>, the memory location <B>i</B>
has two names. It is still known as <B>i</B>, but now it is known
as <B>*p</B> as well. This is how C talks about the two parts
of a pointer variable: <B>p</B> is the location holding the address,
while <B>*p</B> is the location pointed to by that address. Therefore
<B>*p=5</B> means that the location pointed to by <B>p</B> should
be set to 5. Because this location is also <B>i</B>, <B>i</B>
also takes on the value 5. Consequently, <B>j=i;</B> sets <B>j
</B> to 5, and the <B>printf</B> statement produces <B>5 5 5</B>.
<P>
Try the following:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    int i,j;    
    int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */ 
     printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,p,&amp;i);    
    p = &amp;i;    
    printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,p,&amp;i);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code tells the compiler to print out the address held <I>in
</I> <B>p</B>, along with the address <I>of</I> <B>i.</B> The
variable <B>p</B> starts off with some crazy value or with 0.
The address of<B> i </B>is generally a large value. For example,
when I ran this code, I received the following output:
<PRE>
0   2147478276 
2147478276   2147478276 
</PRE>

<P>
which means that the address of <B>i</B> is 2147478276. Once the
statement <B>p = &amp;i;</B> has been executed, <B>p</B> contains
the address of <B>i</B>. Try this as well:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
  
void main()  
{    
    int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */ 
    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,*p);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code tells the compiler to print the value <B>p</B> points
to. However, <B>p</B> has not been initialized yet; it contains
the address 0. A segmentation fault results, which means that
you have used a pointer that points to an invalid area of memory.
Almost always, an uninitialized pointer or a bad pointer address
is the cause of segmentation faults.<HR>

<P>
C is an easy language to learn, especially if you already know
Pascal or some other procedural language. Every concept in Pascal
maps directly to a concept in C: The ideas are exactly the same,
but you use different words to express them. C sometimes seems
difficult because it gives the programmer more freedom, and therefore
makes it easier to make mistakes or create bugs that are hard
to track down.
<P>
These tutorials introduce you to C by showing you how Pascal maps
to it. It also introduces several concepts not found in Pascal.
Most of these new concepts deal with pointers. Readers coming
from a Fortran, Cobol, BASIC, etc. background should find that
the Pascal code is easy to read.
<P>
I believe that the only way to learn C (or any language) is to
write and read a lot of code in it. One very good way to get C
programming experience is to take existing programs that you have
already written and convert them. This way, if the program does
not work in C, you know that the translation is causing the problem
and not the original code.
<P>
One major difference between Pascal and C causes problems: C does
not allow nested procedures, so you must remove any in order to
convert Pascal programs. You should avoid nested procedures in
your Pascal programs altogether or remove nesting from programs
in the Pascal version. That way, you can retest the program in
the Pascal environment before you move it over to C.
<P>
Also watch case sensitivity in C. C compilers consider uppercase
and lowercase characters to be different: XXX, xxx, and Xxx are
three different names in C. By convention, constants in C are
spelled with uppercase, while variables are spelled with lowercase,
or an uppercase/lowercase combination. C Keywords are always lowercase.
<P>
In this tutorial, all compilation instructions and references
to man pages assume that you are working on a fairly normal UNIX
workstation. If you are not, you will have to use the manuals/help
files for your system to map the instructions to your environment.
<P>
In the next tutorial we will start with an extremely simple C
program and build up from there.<HR>

Version 2.0, 2/14/95
</ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS>
These tutorials are excerpted from the book <A HREF = "../../books/motifb.htm" >"Motif Programming: The Essentials and More" 
</A> , by Marshall Brain.
</ADDRESS>
<HR>

<H3>Operators and Operator Precedence</H3>

<P>
The operators in C are similar to the operators in Pascal, as
shown below: 
<PRE>
Pascal C
+      +
-      -
/      /
*      *
div    /
mod    %  
</PRE>

<P>
The / operator performs integer division if both operands are
integers and floating point division otherwise. For example: 
<PRE>
void main()  
{    
    float a; 
    a=10/3;    
    printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;,a);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code prints out a floating point value since a is declared
as type <B>float</B>, but <B>a </B>will be 3.0 because the code
performed an integer division.
<P>
Operator precedence in C is also similar to that in Pascal. As
in Pascal, parentheses control precedence. See tutorial 14 for
more information on precedence, which becomes somewhat complicated
in C once pointers are introduced.
<H3>Typecasting</H3>

<P>
C allows you to perform type conversions on the fly. You do this
especially often when using pointers. Typecasting also occurs
during the assignment operation for certain types. For example,
in the code above, the integer value was automatically converted
to a float.
<P>
You do typecasting in C by placing the type name in parentheses
and putting it in front of the value you want to change. Thus,
in the above code, replacing the line <B>a=10/3;</B> with <B>a=(float)10/3;
</B> produces 3.33333 in a because 10 is converted to a floating
point value before the division.
<H3>Types</H3>

<P>
You declare named, user-defined types in C with the <B>typedef
</B> statement. The following example shows a type that appears
often in C code: 
<PRE>
#define TRUE  1  
#define FALSE 0 
typedef int boolean; 
 
void main()  
{    
    boolean b; 
    
    b=FALSE;    
    blah blah blah  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code allows you to declare Boolean types in C programs.
<P>
If you do not like the word ``float'' for real numbers, you can
say: 
<PRE>
typedef float real;
</PRE>

<P>
and then later say: 
<PRE>
real r1,r2,r3; 
</PRE>

<P>
You can place typedef statements anywhere in a C program as long
as they come prior to their first use in the code. You do not
have to group them together as in Pascal, and you need no special
word to mark the beginning of the block as in Pascal.
<H3>Records</H3>

<P>
Records in C and Pascal are very similar, as shown below. First,
consider a Pascal record. 
<PRE>
type    
    rec=record      
        a,b,c:integer;      
        d,e,f:real;    
    end;  
var    
    r:rec; 
</PRE>

<P>
In C, the same code looks like this: 
<PRE>
struct rec  
{    
    int a,b,c;    
    float d,e,f;  
}; /* Note semicolon */ 
 
struct rec r; 
</PRE>

<P>
As shown here, whenever you want to create records of the type
rec, you have to say <B>struct rec</B>. This line is very easy
to forget, and you get many compiler errors because you absent-mindedly
leave out the <B>struct</B>. You can compress the code into the
form: 
<PRE>
struct rec  
{    
    int a,b,c;    
    float d,e,f;  
} r; 
</PRE>

<P>
where the type declaration for <B>rec</B> and the variable <B>r
</B> are declared in the same statement.
<P>
You access fields of records exactly as in Pascal, using a period
(.), for example, <B>r.a=5;</B>.
<P>
You can declare a typedef for a record. For example, if you do
not like saying <B>struct rec r</B> every time you want to declare
a record, you can say: 
<PRE>
typedef struct rec rec_type; 
</PRE>

<P>
and then declare records of type <B>rec_type</B> by saying: 
<PRE>
rec_type r; 
</PRE>

<H3>Arrays</H3>

<P>
You declare arrays by inserting an array size after a normal declaration,
as shown below: 
<PRE>
int a[10];        /* array of integers */  
char s[100];      /* array of characters (a C string) */  
float f[20];      /* array of reals */  
struct rec r[50]; /* array of records */ 
</PRE>

<H3>Incrementing</H3>

<PRE>
Long Way     Short Way
i=i+1;       i++;
i=i-1;       i--;
i=i+3;       i += 3;
i=i*j;       i *= j; 
</PRE>

<H5>Exercises</H5>

<OL>
<LI>Try out different pieces of code to investigate typecasting
and precedence. Try out <B>int</B>, <B>char</B>, <B>float</B>,
and so on.
<LI>Create an array of records and write some code to sort that
array on one integer field.
</OL>

<H5>C error to avoid</H5>

<OL>
<LI>As described above, using the / operator with two integers
will often produce an unexpected result, so think about it whenever
you use it.

<H3>Introduction to Libraries</H3>

<P>
Libraries are very important in C because the C language supports
only the most basic features that it needs. C does not even contain
I/O functions to read from the keyboard and write to the screen.
Anything that extends beyond the basic language must be written
by a programmer. The resulting chunks of code are placed in libraries.
We have seen the standard I/O, or <B>stdio</B>, library already:
Libraries exist for math functions, string handling, time manipulation,
and so on. Libraries also give you the ability to split up your
programs into modules, which makes them easier to understand,
test, and debug, and also makes it possible to reuse code from
other programs that you write.
<P>
You can create your own libraries easily. As an example, we will
take some code from tutorial 4 and make a library out of two of
its functions:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  
 
#define MAX 10 
 
int a[MAX]; 
int rand_seed=10; 
 
int rand()  
/* from K&amp;R - produces a random number between 0 and 32767.*/  
{    
    rand_seed = rand_seed * 1103515245 +12345;    
    return (unsigned int)(rand_seed / 65536) % 32768;  
} 
 
void main()  
{    
    int i,t,x,y;
  
    /* fill array */    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)    
    {      
        a[i]=rand();      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]);    
    }
  
    /* bubble sort the array */    
    for (x=0; x &lt; MAX-1; x++)      
        for (y=0; y &lt; MAX-x-1; y++)        
            if (a[y] &gt; a[y+1])        
            {  
                t=a[y];  
                a[y]=a[y+1];  
                a[y+1]=t;        
            } 
 
    /* print sorted array */    
    printf(&quot;--------------------\n&quot;);    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)     
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]); 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code fills an array with random numbers, sorts them using
a bubble sort, and then displays the sorted list.
<P>
Take the bubble sort code, and use what you learned in tutorial
6 to make a function from it. Since both the array <B>a</B> and
the constant MAX are known globally, the function you create needs
no parameters, nor does it need to return a result. However, you
should use local variables for x, y, and t.
<P>
Once you have tested the function to make sure it is working,
pass in the number of elements as a parameter rather than using
MAX. Do this first without looking at the code below and then
compare the two only when you have finished.
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
#define MAX 10 
 
int a[MAX]; 
int rand_seed=10; 
 
int rand() /* from K&amp;R - returns random number between 0 and 32767.*/  
{    
    rand_seed = rand_seed * 1103515245 +12345;    
    return (unsigned int)(rand_seed / 65536) % 32768;  
}
  
void bubble_sort(int m)  
{    
    int x,y,t; 
     for (x=0; x &lt; m-1; x++)      
        for (y=0; y &lt; m-x-1; y++)        
            if (a[y] &gt; a[y+1])        
            {  
                t=a[y];  
                a[y]=a[y+1];  
                a[y+1]=t;        
            } 
}
  
void main()  
{    
    int i,t,x,y; 
    /* fill array */    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)    
    {      
        a[i]=rand();      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]);    
    } 
    bubble_sort(MAX); 
    /* print sorted array */    
    printf(&quot;--------------------\n&quot;);    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]); 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
You can also generalize the <B>bubble_sort</B> function even more
by passing in <B>a</B> and the size of a as parameters:
<PRE>
bubble_sort(int m, int a[]) 
</PRE>

<P>
This line says, &quot;Accept the integer array a of any size as
a parameter.&quot; Nothing in the body of the <B>bubble_sort</B>function
needs to change. To call bubble_sort change the call to:
<PRE>
bubble_sort(MAX,a); 
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <B>&amp;a</B> has not been used even though the sort
will change <B>a</B>. The reason for this will become clear in
tutorial 10.
<H3>Making a Library</H3>

<P>
Since the rand and bubble_sort functions in the program above
are useful, you will probably want to reuse them in other programs
you write. You can put them into a utility library to make their
reuse easier.
<P>
Every library consists of two parts: a header file and the actual
code file. The header file, normally denoted by a <B>.h</B> suffix,
contains information about the library that programs using it
need to know. In general, the header file contains constants and
types, along with headers for functions available in the library.
Enter the following header file and save it to a file named <B>util.h
</B>.
<PRE>
/* util.h */
extern int rand(); 
extern void bubble_sort(int,int []); 
</PRE>

<P>
These two lines should remind you of function prototypes. The
word &quot;extern&quot; in C represents functions that will be
linked in later. In an old-style compiler, remove the parameters
from the parameter list of <B>bubble_sort</B>.
<P>
Enter the following code into a file named <B>util.c</B>.
<PRE>
/* util.c */
#include &quot;util.h&quot; 
 
int rand_seed=10; 
 
int rand()  
/* from K&amp;R - produces a random number between 0 and 32767.*/ 
{    
    rand_seed = rand_seed * 1103515245 +12345;    
    return (unsigned int)(rand_seed / 65536) % 32768;  
} 
  
void bubble_sort(int m,int a[])  
{    
    int x,y,t; 
     for (x=0; x &lt; m-1; x++)      
        for (y=0; y &lt; m-x-1; y++) 
            if (a[y] &gt; a[y+1])        
            {  
                t=a[y];  
                a[y]=a[y+1];  
                a[y+1]=t;        
            }  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the file includes its own header file (<B>util.h</B>)
and that it uses quotes instead of the symbols <B>&lt; </B>and
<B>&gt; </B>, which are used only for system libraries. As you
can see, this looks like normal C code. Note that the variable
<B>rand_seed</B>, because it is not in the header file, cannot
be seen or modified by a program using this library. This is called
information hiding. Adding the word <B>static</B> in front of
<B>int</B> enforces the hiding completely.
<P>
Enter the following main program in a file named <B>main.c</B>.
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  
#include &quot;util.h&quot; 
 
#define MAX 10  
 
int a[MAX];  
 
void main()  
{    
    int i,t,x,y; 
    /* fill array */    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)    
    {      
        a[i]=rand();      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]);    
    } 
 
    bubble_sort(MAX,a); 
 
    /* print sorted array */   
    printf(&quot;--------------------\n&quot;);    
    for (i=0; i &lt; MAX; i++)      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]); 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code includes the utility library. The main benefit of using
a library is that the code in the main program is much shorter.
<H3>Compiling and Running with a Library</H3>

<P>
To compile the library, type the following at the command line
(assuming you are using UNIX):
<PRE>
cc -c -g util.c 
</PRE>

<P>
The -c causes the compiler to produce an object file for the library.
The object file contains the library's machine code. It cannot
be executed until it is linked to a program file that contains
a main function. The machine code resides in a separate file named
<B>util.o</B>.
<P>
To compile the main program, type the following:
<PRE>
cc -c -g main.c 
</PRE>

<P>
This line creates a file named <B>main.o</B> that contains the
machine code for the main program. To create the final executable
that contains the machine code for the entire program, link the
two object files by typing the following:
<PRE>
cc -o main main.o util.o 
</PRE>

<P>
which links <B>main.o</B> and <B>util.o</B> to form an executable
named <B>main</B>. To run it, type <B>main</B>.
<P>
It can be cumbersome to type all of the <B>cc</B> lines over and
over again, especially if you are making a lot of changes to the
code and it has several libraries. The <B>make</B> facility solves
this problem. You can use the following makefile to replace the
compilation sequence above:
<PRE>
main: main.o util.o  
        cc -o main main.o util.o 
main.o: main.c util.h 
        cc -c -g main.c 
util.o: util.c util.h  
        cc -c -g util.c 
</PRE>

<P>
Enter this into a file named <B>makefile</B>, and type <B>make
</B>to build the executable. Note that you <I>must</I> precede
all <B>cc</B> lines with a tab. (Eight spaces will not suffice---it
must be a tab. All other lines must be flush left.)
<P>
This makefile contains two types of lines. The lines appearing
flush left are dependency lines. The lines preceded by a tab are
executable lines, which can contain any valid UNIX command. A
dependency line says that some file is dependent on some other
set of files. For example, <B>main.o: main.c util.h</B> says that
the file <B>main.o</B> is dependent on the files <B>main.c</B>and
<B>util.h</B>. If either of these two files changes, the following
executable line(s) should be executed to recreate <B>main.o</B>.
<P>
Note that the final executable produced by the whole makefile
is main, on line 1 in the makefile. The final result of the makefile
should always go on line 1, which in this makefile says that the
file <B>main</B> is dependent on <B>main.o</B> and <B>util.o</B>.
If either of these changes, execute the line <B>cc -o main main.o
util.o</B> to recreate <B>main</B>.
<P>
It is possible to put multiple lines to be executed below a dependency
line---they must all start with a tab. A large program may have
several libraries and a main program. The makefile automatically
recompiles everything that needs to be recompiled because of a
change.<HR>

<P>
Arrays and pointers are intimately linked in C. To use arrays
effectively, you have to know how to use pointers with them. Fully
understanding the relationship between the two requires several
weeks or even months of study, so do not get discouraged if you
do not understand it right away.
<P>
Let's start with the treatment of arrays in Pascal and other languages.
C is nothing like Pascal in this regard, so it will provide a
good contrast. Following is an example of arrays in Pascal:
<PRE>
program samp;  
const    
    max=9;  
var    
    a,b:array[0..max] of integer;    
    i:integer;  
begin    
    for i:=0 to max do      
        a[i]:=i;    
    b:=a;  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
The elements of the array <B>a</B> are initialized, and then all
elements in <B>a</B> are copied into <B>b</B>, so that <B>a </B>and
<B>b</B> are identical. Compare the C version:
<PRE>
#define MAX 10 
 
void main()  
{    
    int a[MAX];    
    int b[MAX];    
    int i; 
     for(i=0; i&lt;MAX; i++) 
        a[i]=i;   
    b=a;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Enter this code and try to compile it. You will find that C will
not compile it. If you want to copy <B>a</B> into <B>b</B>, you
have to enter something like the following:
<PRE>
for (i=0; i&lt;MAX; i++)      
    a[i]=b[i]; 
</PRE>

<P>
Or, to put it more succinctly:
<PRE>
for (i=0; i&lt;MAX; a[i]=b[i], i++); 
</PRE>

<P>
Better yet, use the <B>memcpy</B> utility in <B>string.h</B>.
<P>
Arrays in C are unusual in that variables <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>
are not, technically, arrays themselves but permanent pointers
to arrays. Thus, they point to blocks of memory that hold the
arrays. They hold the addresses of the actual arrays, but since
they are <B>permanent </B>pointers, you cannot change their addresses.
The statement <B>a=b;</B> therefore does not work.
<P>
Because <B>a</B> and <B>b</B> are pointers, you can do several
interesting things with pointers and arrays. For example, the
following code works:
<PRE>
#define MAX 10 
 
void main()  
{    
    int a[MAX];     
    int b[MAX];    
    int i;    
    int *p,*q; 
     
    for(i=0; i&lt;MAX; i++);  
        a[i]=i;   
    p=a;    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,*p);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
The statement <B>p=a;</B> works because <B>a</B> is a pointer.
Technically, <B>a</B> points to the address of the 0th element
of the actual array. This element is an integer, so <B>a</B> is
a pointer to a single integer. Therefore, declaring <B>p</B> as
a pointer to an integer and setting it equal to <B>a</B> works.
Another way to say exactly the same thing would be to replace
<B>p=a;</B> with <B>p=&amp;a[0];</B>. Since <B>a</B> contains
the address of <B>a[0]</B>, <B>a</B> and <B>&amp;a[0]</B>mean
the same thing.
<P>
Now that <B>p</B> is pointing at the 0th element of <B>a</B>,
you can do some rather strange things with it. The <B>a</B> variable
is a permanent pointer and can not be changed, but <B>p</B> is
not subject to such restrictions. C actually encourages you to
move it around using <I>pointer arithmetic </I>. For example,
if you say <B>p++;</B>, the compiler knows that <B>p</B> points
to an integer, so this statement increments <B>p</B> the appropriate
number of bytes to move it to the next element of the array. If
<B>p</B> were pointing to an array of 100-byte-long structures,
<B>p++;</B> would move <B>p</B> over by 100 bytes. C takes care
of the details of element size.
<P>
You can copy the array <B>a</B> into <B>b</B> using pointers as
well. The following code can replace <B>(for i=0; i&lt;MAX; a[i]=b[i],
i++);</B> :
<PRE>
p=a;    
q=b;    
for (i=0; i&lt;MAX; i++)    
{      
    *q = *p;      
    q++;      
    p++;    
} 
</PRE>

<P>
You can abbreviate this code as follows:
<PRE>
p=a;    
q=b;    
for (i=0; i&lt;MAX; i++)     
    *q++ = *p++; 
</PRE>

<P>
And you can further abbreviate it to:
<PRE>
for (p=a,q=b,i=0; i&lt;MAX; *q++ = *p++, i++); 
</PRE>

<P>
What if you go beyond the end of the array <B>a</B> or <B>b</B>
with the pointers <B>p</B> or <B>q</B>? C does not care-it blithely
goes along incrementing <B>p</B> and <B>q</B>, copying away over
other variables with abandon. You need to be careful when indexing
into arrays in C, because C assumes that you know what you are
doing.
<P>
You can pass an array such as <B>a</B> or <B>b</B> to a function
in two different ways. Imagine a function <B>dump</B> that accepts
an array of integers as a parameter and prints the contents of
the array to stdout. There are two ways to code <B>dump</B>:
<PRE>
void dump(int a[],int nia)  
{    
    int i;     
     for (i=0; i&lt;nia; i++)      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,a[i]);  
}
</PRE>

<P>
or:
<PRE>
void dump(int *p,int nia)  
{    
    int i;     
     for (i=0; i&lt;nia; i++)      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,*p++);  
}
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>nia</B> (number_in_array) variable is required so that
the size of the array is known. Note that only a pointer to the
array, rather than the contents of the array, is passed to the
function. Also note that C functions can accept variable-size
arrays as parameters, which is not possible in Pascal. <HR>

</A> , by Marshall Brain.
</ADDRESS>
<HR>

<P>
Binary files are very similar to arrays of records, except the
records are in a disk file rather than in an array in memory.
Because the records in a binary file are on disk, you can create
very large collections of them (limited only by your available
disk space). They are also permanent and always available. The
only disadvantage is the slowness that comes from disk access
time.
<P>
Binary files have two features that distinguish them from text
files: You can jump instantly to any record in the file, which
provides random access as in an array; and you can change the
contents of a record anywhere in the file at any time. Binary
files also usually have faster read and write times than text
files, because a binary image of the record is stored directly
from memory to disk (or vice versa). In a text file, everything
has to be converted back and forth to text, and this takes time.
<P>
Pascal supports the file-of-records concept very cleanly. You
declare a variable such as <B>var f:file of rec;</B> and then
open the file. At that point, you can read a record, write a record,
or seek to any record in the file. This file structure supports
the concept of a <I>file pointer</I>. When the file is opened,
the pointer points to record 0 (the first record in the file).
Any read operation reads the currently pointed-to record and moves
the pointer down one record. Any write operation writes to the
currently pointed-to record and moves the pointer down one record.
Seek moves the pointer to the requested record.
<P>
In C, the concepts are exactly the same but less concise. Keep
in mind that C thinks of everything in the disk file as blocks
of bytes read from disk into memory or read from memory onto disk.
C uses a file pointer, but it can point to any byte location in
the file.
<P>
The following program illustrates these concepts:
<PRE>
 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
/* random record description - could be anything */  
struct rec  
{        
    int x,y,z;  
}; 
 
/* writes and then reads 10 arbitrary records from the file &quot;junk&quot;. */ 
void main()  
{    
    int i,j;    
    FILE *f;    
    struct rec r; 
     
    /* create the file of 10 records */    
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;w&quot;);    
    for (i=1;i&lt;=10; i++)    
    {      
        r.x=i;      
        fwrite(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);    
    }    
    fclose(f);      
     
    /* read the 10 records */     
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);    
    for (i=1;i&lt;=10; i++)    
    {      
        fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,r.x);    
    }    
    fclose(f);    
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);       
    
    /* use fseek to read the 10 records in reverse order */ 
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);    
    for (i=9; i&gt;=0; i--)    
    {      
        fseek(f,sizeof(struct rec)*i,SEEK_SET);      
        fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,r.x);    
    }    
    fclose(f);    
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;); 
    
    /* use fseek to read every other record */  
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);    
    fseek(f,0,SEEK_SET);    
    for (i=0;i&lt;5; i++)    
    {      
        fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);      
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,r.x);      
        fseek(f,sizeof(struct rec),SEEK_CUR);    
    }    
    fclose(f);    
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;); 
    
    /* use fseek to read 4th record, change it, and write it back */    
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;r+&quot;);    
    fseek(f,sizeof(struct rec)*3,SEEK_SET);    
    fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);    
    r.x=100;

    /* read the 10 records to insure 4th record was changed */     
    f=fopen(&quot;junk&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);    
    for (i=1;i&lt;=10; i++)    
    {     
        fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);

<P>
In this program, a meaningless record description <B>rec</B> has
been used, but you can use any record description you want. You
can see that <B>fopen</B> and <B>fclose</B> work exactly as they
did for text files.
<P>
The new functions here are fread, fwrite and fseek. The fread
function takes four parameters: a memory address, the number of
bytes to read per block, the number of blocks to read, and the
file variable. Thus, the line <B>fread(&amp;r,sizeof(struct rec),1,f);
</B> says to read 12 bytes (the size of <B>rec</B>) from the file
<B>f</B> (from the current location of the file pointer) into
memory address <B>&amp;r</B>. One block of 12 bytes is requested.
It would be just as easy to read 100 blocks from disk into an
array in memory by changing 1 to 100.
<P>
The <B>fwrite</B> function works the same way, but moves the block
of bytes from memory to the file. The <B>fseek</B> function moves
the file pointer to a byte in the file. Generally, you move the
pointer in <B>sizeof(struct rec)</B> increments to keep the pointer
at record boundaries. You can use three options when seeking:
SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END. SEEK_SET moves the pointer <B>x
</B> bytes down from the beginning of the file (from byte 0 in
the file). SEEK_CUR moves the pointer <B>x</B> bytes down from
the current pointer position. SEEK_END moves the pointer from
the end of the file (so you must use negative offsets with this
option).
<P>
Several different options appear in the code above. In particular,
note the section where the file is opened with <B>r+</B> mode.
This opens the file for reading and writing, which allows records
to be changed. The code seeks to a record, reads it, and changes
a field; it then seeks back because the read displaced the pointer,
and writes the change back.<HR>

<HR>

<P>
Most C programmers first need to use pointers for variable parameters.
Suppose you have a simple procedure in Pascal that swaps two integer
values:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var  
    a,b:integer; 
 
procedure swap(var i,j:integer);    
var t:integer;    
begin      
    t:=i;      
    i:=j;      
    j:=t;    
end; 
  
begin    
    a:=5;    
    b:=10;    
    writeln(a,b);    
    swap(a,b);    
    writeln(a,b);  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
Because this code uses variable parameters, it swaps the values
<B>a</B> and <B>b</B> correctly.
<P>
C has no formal mechanism for passing variable parameters: It
passes everything by value. Enter and execute the following code
and see what happens:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   
 
void swap(int i, int j)    
{    
    int t; 
    
    t=i;    
    i=j;    
    j=t;  
} 
 
void main()  
{    
    int a,b; 
    
    a=5;  
    b=10;    
    printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,a,b);    
    swap(a,b);    
    printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,a,b);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
No swapping takes place. The values of <B>a</B> and <B>b</B> are
passed to swap, but no values are returned.
<P>
To make this function work correctly, you must use pointers, as
shown below:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   
 
void swap(int *i, int *j)    
{    
    int t; 
    t = *i;    
    *i = *j;    
    *j = t;  
} 
 
void main()  
{    
    int a,b; 
    a=5;    
    b=10;    
    printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,a,b);    
    swap(&amp;a,&amp;b);    
    printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;,a,b);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
To get an idea of what this code does, print it out, draw the
two integers <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>, and enter 5 and 10 in them.
Now draw the two pointers <B>i</B> and <B>j</B>, along with the
integer <B>t</B>. When <B>swap</B> is called, it is passed the
<I>addresses</I> of <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>. Thus, <B>i </B>points
to <B>a</B> (draw an arrow from <B>i</B> to <B>a</B>) and <B>j
</B> points to <B>b</B> (draw another arrow from <B>b</B> to 
<B>j</B>). Because the pointers have been established, <B>*i</B>
is another name for <B>a</B>, and <B>*j</B> is another name for
<B>b</B>. Now run the code in <B>swap</B>. When the code uses
<B>*i</B> and <B>*j</B>, it really means <B>a</B> and <B>b</B>.
When the function completes, a and b have been swapped.
<P>
Suppose you accidentally forget the <B>&amp;</B> when the <B>swap
</B> function is called, and that the <B>swap</B> line accidentally
looks like this: <B>swap(a,b);</B>. This causes a segmentation
fault. When you leave out the <B>&amp;</B>, the value of <B>a
</B> is passed instead of its address. Therefore, <B>i</B> points
to an invalid location in memory and the system crashes when 
<B>*i</B> is used.
<P>
This is also why <B>scanf</B> crashes if you forget <B>&amp;</B>---
<B>scanf</B> is using pointers to put the value it reads back
into the variable you have passed. Without <B>&amp;</B>, <B>scanf
</B> is passed a bad address and crashes.<HR>

<A NAME="offline"><H3>"I thought I should be doing the tutorial off line, but then can't access my pages because my web browser keeps trying to dial up my PPP. How do you run 
it off line for Web page design?"</H3></A>

Most web browsers have a <b>Preferences</b> or <b>Options</b> menu where you put the address of your favorite "home" page--that is, every time you launch the browser, it attempts to connect to this site. Some browsers have an option where you can specify it to start with a <b>blank</b> or <b>empty</b> page. Another approach is to cancel the connection when your modem tries to dial. Another idea (which you can do easily when you finish our tutorial) is to create your very own Home Page that sits on the hard drive. Use your web browser to <B>Open...</b> or <B>Open Local...</B> and find the page. Use your mouse to copy the address or file path indicated in the URL field (usually near the top of a browser window) and then paste it into the area of your Preferences/Options that says "Home Page". This way, when ever the web browser starts, you see your custom page with all the links you like, and you do not have to wait or even connect to an Internet server.


<A NAME="seeout"><H3>"I've created my web pages, but why can't anyone else see them on the Internet?  What's the URL to my hard drive?"</H3></A>
When you create your web pages, think of them as being able to see out to the entire
Internet world (when you are connected to the network). BUT the entire world cannot see back
into your computer since it does not have a WWW address on the Internet. If you want to <i>publish</i> on the Internet,
you must first locate an Internet Service provider that rents space on its World Wide Web
server. If you are at a school or a large company, contact your network administrators. You may
want to contact the company that provides your access to the Internet and ask if they rent web
server space. If you are shopping, try 
<A HREF="http://www.thelist.com/">MecklerMedia's Provider List</A>

<A NAME="upload"><H3>"I've created my web pages on my desktop computer- how do I get them to a WWW server"</H3></A>
So you have arranged somehow to get web server space! Generally, WWW servers are UNIX computers and you will have to find a utility to transfer
files from your desktop computer to the WWW server. If you do not have a program, search the <A HREF="http://vsl.cnet.com/">Virtual Software Library</A> for a "ftp" utility. If the WWW server you will use is a Macintosh or Windows-based computer, you may be able to transfer the files over
your local network. This is one question you will have to ask of whomever is providing
you access to the WWW server.


<A NAME="nochange"><H3>"I've updated my web pages but do not see the changes in my web browser. Why?"</H3></A>
First, double-checked that you have <B>Saved</B> your HTML file from your text editor. The try using the <B>Reload</B> option in your web browser. Or, the browser may be looking at another copy of the HTML file; in the browser, use <B>Open File...</B> to read in the intended document.

<A NAME="title"><H3>"Why don't I see the text in my <TT>&lt;title&gt;....&lt;/title&gt;</TT> tag on my Web page?"</H3></A>
Recall from <A HREF="tut1.html">lesson 1</A> that the <TT>&lt;title&gt;....&lt;/title&gt;</TT> tag is part of the information in the HEAD of your HTML file; only the BODY is displayed on the page. The text in the title tag should appear on the menubar of your web browser and it is how the browser will track your pages from its navigation/history menus. It's not uncommon to write what appears to be redundant HTML:

<PRE>  &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;New Products from Zippy Communications&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;New Products from Zippy Communications&lt;h1&gt;
  ......
  ......
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
</PRE> 

The same text is used twice- once for the web browser to identify the page and once in the <TT>&lt;h1&gt;</TT> tag to put the same title on the page.

<A NAME="oddchars"><H3>"When I load my web pages into my web browser, why do I see odd characters at the top of the screen."</H3></A>
If you are using a word processing program to create your HTML files, be sure that you are saving them
as plain text (ASCII) format- these characters are hidden formatting codes. For Windows users, do not
use the Write application- it will add a bothersome "1" at the top of the screen. Your best bet is to start
out by using the simplest text editor possible- the Windows NotePad or TeachText/SimpleText for
the Macintosh. Once you know the basic tags, then go looking for a program to help with the
shortcuts.

<A NAME="iconquestion"><H3>"Why do I see an icon with a question mark rather then my inline image?"</H3></A>
This icon means that your web browser could not locate the image file. first check to see that
it is in the same folder/directory that you reference in the 
<TT>&lt;img src= &quot;...&quot;&gt;</TT> tag. Next make sure the spelling of the file name exactly
matches the file name written in the <TT>&lt;img src= &quot;...&quot;&gt;</TT> tag

<A NAME="iconbroken"><H3>"Why do I see an icon with a broken corner rather then my inline image?"</H3></A>
In this case, the external file is a format not recognized by your web browser. 
Make sure that the file is in the GIF format.

<A NAME="nohtml"><h3>Could you please help with a tag that makes all HTML commands inside the tag text/ignored?</h3></A>
<I><B>Bad news first...</B></I>
<p>
There is no such tag. Even if you use <TT>&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</TT> tags, your browser will interpret any HTML as... HTML. 
<p>
<I><B>Good news next...</B></I>
<p>
All you need to do is substitute the "special characters" 
(see <A HREF="tut9.html">lesson 9</A>) to replace all occurences of the
<TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&gt;</TT> charcters:
 
<UL>
	<LI>Replace all <TT>"&lt;"</TT> with <TT>"&amp;lt;"</TT>
	<LI>Replace all <TT>"&lt;"</TT> with <TT>"&amp;lt;"</TT>
</UL>

This will display them as the characters and not interpret them as HTML.
<p>

<A NAME="download"><h3>"How  can I make the downloading function work? Is it just to specify where my zip-file is, the path to it? Or do I have to make a FTP 
server on our server.  Is that all there is to it or is there some other magic working behind the scene on your server that I need to be aware of to make it 
work on our server?</h3></A>
No magic necessary. Just build your <TT>&lt;a href=....&gt;</TT> links to point
at the file. Even when you access files locally (like from your hard drive, your web browser will know how to handle the files. For Windows files, <TT>.zip</TT> and <TT>.exe</TT> files are pretty standard. Macintosh files on the other hand should always be compressed as BinHex (<TT>.hqx</TT>).  Most web servers are preset to transmit files who's names end in these extensions.


<A NAME="counter"><h3>"How do you create a counter that shows how many times someone has visited your page?"</h3></A>
Counters require programs that run from a web server, which is really beyond the scope of just "Writing HTML." There are scads of information for counters at the Yahoo <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Access_Counts/">Access Counts</A> page.


<A NAME="copyright"><H3>"This tutorial is great! Can I make copies?"</H3></A>
Yes, you can <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/download.html">download</A> the entire tutorial and use at your location. However, you must make sure that
you give credit to the Maricopa Center for Learning and Instruction and

<b><font size=+2>W</font>RITING HTML</b> was created to help teachers create learning resources that access information on the Internet. Therefore, the exercises here involve writing a lesson called <i>Volcano Web</i>. 
However, this tutorial may be used by anyone who wants 
to create World Wide Web pages. The lessons cover the basic elements of web pages that can be opened and displayed from any computer.
<p>
By the time you have reached the end of this
tutorial you will be able to construct a series of linked web pages for any subject that includes formatted text,
pictures, and hypertext links to other web pages on the Internet.
<p>
Curious? Then peek at the web that you will create in this tutorial (<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut14_ex/index.html">Basic HTML 2.0 version</A>, lessons 1-14; <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/index.html">Advanced HTML 3.0</a>, lessons 1-23). For faster performance, you can <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/download.html">download</A> an archive of all files used in this tutorial. Most of the lessons can even be done offline.

<h2>Why Create World Wide Web Pages?</h2>
Because everyone else is? <b>Wrong!</b>
<p>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
World Wide Web</A> is a unique tool which allows you to access not
only text but also 
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/pix/surf.jpg">
picture</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/sounds/clap.au">
sound</A>, or
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/video/rocket.mpg">video</A>
information from across the Internet world. 
For more examples of how the web is used as an instructional tool, see our searchable collection of 
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cgi-bin/index_tl">Teaching and Learning on the WWW</A>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
This tutorial covers the steps for writing HTML files and provides illustrative
examples for creating web pages. 
In these lessons you will:
<ul>
<li>identify and use different HTML formatting
conventions.
<li>create and modify HTML documents using a simple
text editor program such
as TeachText for the Macintosh or NotePad for Windows.
<li>write a lesson that presents information,
graphics, and provides hypertext links to other documents on the
Internet.
</ul>
In this tutorial, you will be creating a World Wide Web page that is itself
a lesson called <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/index.html">Volcano Web.</A>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html"> HTML</A>,
or <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage,
is the format that tells a web browser how to 
displays its multimedia documents. The documents themselves
are plain text files (ASCII) with special "tags" or codes
that a web browser knows how to interpret and
display on your screen. With just a simple text editor, you
can create your own World Wide Web-based pages or
information centers that connect to the Internet.
See the <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/w3info/">
MCLI WWW InfoPage</A> for related HTML resources and guides.


<H2>Getting Ready...</H2>
This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of how to
use your web browser menus, buttons, and hypertext links.
Since you are reading this page, we can also assume that
you are at a computer capable of running a World Wide Web
browser program. For more about the World Wide Web, see the
<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/">
WWW Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</A> or any of the many
items available from our own
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/w3info/">
WWW InfoPage</A>
<p>
You should have access to a word processor or text editor
program capable of creating plain text files. Examples are
the ones that come standard with system software, i.e.
SimpleText for the Macintosh or NotePad for Windows. <B><I>We strongly
urge that you use the most basic text editor while you learn HTML and then later you can explore some of the many HTML "editors" available.</I></B>
If you use a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Word Perfect
then you <B>must</B> save your files as plain ASCII text format. You
should also be familiar with switching between multiple
applications as well as using the mouse to copy and paste
selections of text.
<p>
If you <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/download.html">download</A> the tutorial files, you can do nearly all of the lessons off-line. If so, you want to look for options to set in your web browser or network software so that it does not immediately try to connect to the Internet when you launch the web browser program (i.e. in <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">NetScape</A> Navigator, you can set the preferences to "open browser with blank page").

<h2>How the Tutorial Works</h2>
We suggest that you proceed through the lessons in the
listed order, but at any time you can
return to the index to jump to a different lesson. At
times you may want to print a page-- It's easy! 
Just select <b>Print</b> from the <b>File</b> menu of your web browser.
<p>
As a convention, all menu names and items will be shown in
<b>bold</b> text. All text that you should enter from the
keyboard will appear in <tt>typewriter style</tt>.
<p>
Within each lesson, you can click on a link that shows a
sample HTML file for that section.


<H2>Before You Start...</H2>
<ol type=a>
<li>Use the <b>Hotlist</b> or <B>Bookmark</B> feature of your
web browser to mark the lesson index page so you can easily get to other lessons.
<li>We've written instructions generic to
<b>any</b> web browser; sometimes
the menu names or features may not match the web browser you are using. 
<li>This tutorial <b>will</b> show you how to create web pages that can see outward to the world. It <B>will not</B> tell you how to let the world see them; to do this you need to
locate an <A HREF="http://thelist.com/">Internet Service Provider</A> that  
provides web server space.
<li>We cannot highly enough recommend the <A HREF="http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/StyleManual_Top.HTML">Yale C/AIM WWW Style Manual</A> and
Andy King's <A HREF="http://webreference.com/">Webmaster Reference Library</A>.
<li>When you are ready for the big time, visit web pages like you have ever seen web pages at Dave Siegel's <A HREF="http://www.dsiegel.com/">Casbah</A> and <A HREF="http://www.highfive.com/">High Five</A> sites. Trudge on over to his <A HREF="http://www.dsiegel.com/tips/index.html">Web Wonk</A> to get the details. It will amaze you.
</ol>

<H2>While You are Doing...</H2>
<ol type=a>
<li>Refer to the HTML <A HREF="tag2.html">tag summary page</A> as a reference.
<li>If you are having trouble, see if your situation is covered in our Writing HTML <A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</A> (Frequently Asked Questions).
</ol>
<H2>When You Are Done...</H2>
Once your web pages become available on the World Wide Web, please list them
on our <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cgi-bin/alumni.pl">Writing HTML Alumni</A> page using 
our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/alumni.html">registration form.</A>
<h2>Who did this?</h2>
Writing HTML was developed by <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/alan/">Alan Levine</A>, instructional technologist at
the <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/mcccd/">Maricopa Community Colleges</A>. 
Tom Super provided instructional design support. Many others have given helpful
suggestions, corrected typos, and expressed their thanks!

<H1>Version History</H1>
<dl>


<dt><B>Version 2.0 / December 1995</B>
<dd>Cleaned up typos. Added explanation for <TT>height</TT> and <TT>width</TT> attributes for inline images in <A HREF="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</A>. Re-organized lesson structure for pictures in subfolders and example
files for lessons after <A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A>. This not only explained other ways of linking web directories, but made it more managable for setting up the example files for later lessons where one page became many pages. Added explanation in lesson <A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A> for relative URLS that link upwards in the directory structure. New lessons on <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut14.html">Splitting vs Lumping</A> (14) of long web pages; <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut15.html">NetScape and HTML 3.0 issues</A> (15); <A HREF="tut16.html">colored and texture backgrounds</A> (16); the dreaded <A HREF="tut17.html">&lt;blink&gt;</A> tag (17); <A HREF="tut18.html">spiffing up text</A> (colors, sizes, superscripts, subscripts) (18); more <A HREF="tut19.html">options for the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag</A> (19); <A HREF="tut20.html">aligning text and images</A> (20); <A HREF="tut21.html">Tables</A> (21); <A HREF="tut22.html">More for Images and Lists</A> (22); and <A HREF="tut23.html">Clickable Image Maps</A> (23)
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cgi-bin/alumni.pl">Alumni page</A> now pulls 10 names at random rather than listing them all.

<dt><B>Version 1.7 / November 1995</B>
<dd>Still fixing typos with the help of our audience. Added <A HREF="tag2.html">summary page</A> for all HTML used in the tutorial and
a <A HREF="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</A> page.
With help from <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/~kurt/">Kurt Leinbach</A>, developed <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/alumni.html">CGI form</A> for 
registering our <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cgi-bin/alumni.pl">alumni</A> 

<dt><B>Version 1.51 / September 1995</B>
<dd>New lesson for <A HREF="tut13.html">Blockquotes</A> (13).

<dt><B>Version 1.5 / August 1995</B>
<dd>Re-writes for improved directions and fixed the many typos (thanks to
Jennifer Adamson). Minor cosmetic changes. Added &lt;br&gt; tag to <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut2.html">lesson 2</A>.
Until we write some new lessons, provide links to sites for HTML 3.0, CGI,
Image Maps.
<dt><B>Version 1.41 / June 1995</B>
<dd>Removed use of the <TT>underline</TT> &lt;u&gt; tags which were once supported
by NCSA Mosaic. Added <A HREF="tut12.html">lesson 12</A> for using the <TT>mailto:</TT> link
and the &lt;address&gt; tag.

<dt><B>Version 1.4 / May 1995</B>
<dd>Removed directions specific to NCSA Mosaic, new logo. Several
links to external sites were updated.

<dt><B>Version 1.3.1 / February 7, 1995</B>
<dd>Typos fixed as well as inconsistencies in the sample lessons, with
thanks to Robin Wright.

<dt><B>Version 1.3 / December 15, 1994</B>
<dd>New lessons added for <A HREF="tut8d.html">Named Anchors</A> (8d); 
<A HREF="tut9.html">Preformatted Text</A> (9);
<A HREF="tut10.html">Special Character Sets</A> (10); and 
<A HREF="tut11.html">Descriptive Lists</A> (11). 
Information on using the <TT>ALT</TT> keyword in the 
<TT>&lt;IMG&gt;</TT> tag was added to <A HREF="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</A>, "Inline Graphics".

<dt><B>Version 1.2 / November 15, 1994</B>
<dd>Links to external sites were verified and updated. Directions
were re-written to take into account the increasing number of different web
browsers, each of which may have commands under different menus.
Navigation links between lessons were moved to the top of the page.

<dt><B>Version 1.1 / July 1, 1994</B>
<dd>Based on the surveys from our June workshop, we updated several the exercises 
to make the descriptions more clear. First version placed

<h1>1. Creating Your First HTML Document</h1>
You are about to embark on a journey that will transform you from a 
mere <b><A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/pix/surf.jpg">Internet Surfer</A></b> 
of the World Wide Web to an Internet Author of Multimedia!
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the meaning and purpose of HTML tags.
<li>Open up a workspace for creating new World Wide Web documents.
<li>Create the basic structure for any World Wide Web document in HTML 
format using a text editor.
<li>Open your document within your web browser to see how it is displayed.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
Now that you think you know what HTML is (quick quiz- what do those letters stand for? if you read the <A HREF="index2.html">introduction</A> you would know!),
let's start using it.

<h3>What are HTML tags?</h3>
When a web browser displays a page such as the one you are reading now, it
reads from a text file, and looks for special codes or "tags" that
are marked by the &lt; and &gt; signs.  The general format for a HTML
tag is:
<pre>     &lt;tag name&gt;string of text&lt;/tag name&gt;
</pre>

As an example, the title for this section uses a <tt>header</tt> tag:
<pre>     &lt;h3&gt;What are HTML tags?&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>

This tag tells a web browser to display the text <b>What are HTML
tags?</b> in the style of header level 3.  HTML tags may tell a 
web browser to bold the text, italicize it, make it into a header, or make
it be a hypertext link to another web page.  It is important to note that the
ending tag, 
<pre>    &lt;/tag name&gt;
</pre>
contains the "/" slash character.
This "/" slash tells a web browser to stop tagging the text.  Many HTML
tags are paired this way.  If you forget the slash, a web browser
will continue the tag for the rest of the text in your document, producing
undesirable results (as an experiment you may want to try this later).

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: A web browser does not care if you use upper or lower case. For
example, <TT>&lt;h3&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;</TT> is no different from
<TT>&lt;H3&gt;...&lt;/H3&gt;</TT></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

Unlike computer programming, if you make a typographical error in HTML you will
not get a "bomb" or "crash" the system; your web page will simply look, well...
wrong. It is quick and easy to go inside the HTML and make the changes.

<h3>Opening Up Your Workspace</h3>
To complete the lessons in this tutorial, you should create a
second web window (this allows you to keep this window with the lesson instructions
and one window as your "workspace"), plus open your text editor
application in a third window.  
<p>
So you will want to be pretty comfortable jumping between different applications and windows
on your computer. Another option  is to
print out the lesson instructions (but we really do not want to promote tree carnage).
<p>
Here are the steps for setting up your workspace:

<ol>
<li>From the <b>File</b> menu of your web browser, select <b>New Window</b>.
A second web should appear. Think of the first  window as your
"textbook" and the second clone window as your "workspace" for
completing the HTML lessons. 
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>NOTE: 
Not all web browsers support multiple windows. The only reason to
have two windows here is so that you can read the instructions for the lessons and
also view your working document.</b>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<li>Next, you need to jump out of the web browser and open your text editor program. 
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>NOTE: You will need to move back and forth between the
different
windows to complete these lessons. This can be a challenge depending
on the size of your monitor. You may choose to resize the three
windows so that they all fit on your screen or layer your windows so
you can click on any of them to bring it to the front.
<p>
If you are using a word processor program to create your HTML, be sure to save
in plain text (or ASCII) format. 
</b>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</ol>
<h3>Creating Your HTML Document</h3>
If you are just starting out, we most STRONGLY recommend that you
use the simplest text editor available- SimpleText/TeachText for the Macintosh or the Windows NotePad. Why not use those nifty HTML editors? It is sound instructional design that you first learn the concepts and THEN look for shortcuts or helpers that make the work less tedious.
<p>
Also, it will help you if you first create a new directory/folder on your computer that will be your work area. You can call it <TT>workarea</TT> or <TT>myspace</TT> or whatever you like; just make sure that you keep all of the files you create in this one area. It will make your life simpler... well, at least while working on this tutorial!
<p>
An HTML document contains two distinct parts, the head and the body. The
<B>head</B> contains information about the document that is not displayed
on the screen. The <b>body</b> then contains everything else that is displayed.
<p>
The basic structure then of any HTML page is:
<pre>
  &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     ** [header info used by some web servers, not displayed] **
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    ** [all the HTML for display] **
          :      :
          :      :
          :      :
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
Enclose all HTML work within an <TT>&lt;html&gt;....&lt;/html&gt;</TT> tag. Note that
your web pages will display fine on most computers without any of these tags. However
by using them, your web pages will be fully compliant with International
HTML standards and ensure compatibility with future web browsers.
<p>
It's good habit, like brushing your teeth.
<p>
Here are the steps for creating your first HTML file. Are you ready?
<ol>
<li>Go to the text editor window.  
<li>Enter the following text (you do not have to press RETURN at the
end of each line; the web browser will word wrap all text):
<pre>
     &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     
     &lt;body&gt;
     In this lesson you will use the Internet to research 
     information on volcanoes and then write a report on 
     your results.
     &lt;/body&gt;
     &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Look where the <TT>&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</TT> tag is located.
It is in the <TT>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</TT> portion and thus will not be
visible on the screen. What does it do? The <TT>&lt;title&gt;</TT> tag is used to
uniquely identify each document and is also displayed in the title bar of
the browser window. 
<p>In <A HREF="tut3.html">lesson 3</A> you will learn how to 
add a title that will appear directly on your web page.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>Save the document as a file called <tt>"Volc.html"</tt> and keep it in
the "work area" folder/directory you set up for this tutorial. 
Also, if you are using a word processor program to create your HTML, be sure to save in plain text (or ASCII) format.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: For Windows users, by DOS file name conventions, you will must name all HTML files with extensions of <TT>.HTM</TT>, so in this case your file should be <TT>VOLC.HTM</TT></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

By using this file name extension, a web browser will know to read these text 
files as HTML and properly display the web page. 
</ol>

<h3>Displaying Your Document In a web browser</h3>
<ol>
<li>Return to the window you are using for your work space.
<li>Select <b>Open File...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
<li>Use the dialog box to find and open the file you created,
<tt>"Volc.html"</tt>
<li>You should now see within the workspace window "Volcano Web" 
in the title bar and the HTML text you created displayed
in WWW format underneath.
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your document with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut1_ex.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. After viewing the sample, use the
<b>back</b> button on your web browser to return to this page.
<p>
If your document was different than the sample, review the
text you entered in the text editor. A common mistake is
"I cannot see the title!". The text within the 
<TT>&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</TT> tag is <B>NOT</B> displayed
on the web page; you will likely see it in the titlebar
of the web browser window
<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are HTML tags?
<li>Where is the text of the title tag displayed?
<li>What steps are involved in creating a simple HTML document?
<li>How can you display your HTML document in a web browser?
</ol>
<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Think of a topic for your own web page. Now create your own HTML
text file that includes a <TT>&lt;title&gt;</TT> tag and a few introductory
sentences. Save the HTML file and reload it in your web browser.  Keep this
file handy as you will add to it in later lessons.
<hr>
<h2>Coming Next....</h2>
Your first web page is done! <p>
But, to be honest, it is pretty short and not very
exciting! In the next lesson you will modify and update your HTML
document.<p>

<h1>9. Preformatted Text</h1>
How do you 
<pre>   display       text 
where        space   and   carriage return
                       characters   count?
</pre>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create a table of aligned text
<li>Control the placement of text on a page when tabs and spaces
are important.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut9get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<P>
In previous lessons we have seen that a web browser will ignore extraneous space
characters, tabs, and carriage returns. However, there are some instances where it
will be important to maintain these aspects of page layout. 
In this lesson, the example will be where we want to insert a table of 
text with aligned columns.
<P>
The <TT>preformat</TT> tag instructs your web browser to display the text <B>exactly</B> as
typed in the HTML document, including spaces, tabs, and carriage returns.
A browser typically displays such text as a <TT>m o n o s p a c e d</TT> type. An example
of the <tt>preformat</tt> tag:

<pre>
   &lt;pre&gt;
    We have indented with 5 space characters.
    And used the carriage return to jump
    to
    a
    new
    line.
    
          Here      we
          use       
          spaces    to
          create    a
          text      table.
   &lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

Without the <TT>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> and  <TT>&lt;/pre&gt;</TT> tags, 
the same HTML produce:
<hr>
<blockquote>
    We have indented with 5 space characters.
    And used the carriage return to jump
    to
    a
    new
    line.
    
          Here      we
          use       
          spaces    to
          create    a
          text      table.
</blockquote>
<hr>

With the <TT>preformat</TT> tag, it helps if the text editor you are using can
display in a mono-spaced font (such as "courier" or "monoco"); if not you will
have to count spaces when aligning text into columns.
<P>
For our Volcano lesson, we want to add a table under the <B>Introduction</B> section
that lists several well-known volcanoes, when they erupted, and the volume
of erupted material. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Open the second HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>Under the last portion of the <B>Introduction</B> section, place a header of level 4
(&lt;h4&gt;) with the text <b><tt>Volumes of Some Well-Known Volcanic Eruptions</tt></b> (If you
do not remember how to make headers, see <A HREF="tut3.html">lesson 3</A>).
<li>Below this heading, enter the following text:
<pre>
&lt;pre&gt;
  Eruption                      Date           Volume in km^3
  --------                      ----           --------------
  Paricutin, Mexico             1943                 1.3
  Mt. Vesuvius, Italy          79 A.D.                3
  Mount St. Helen, Washington   1980                  4
  Krakatoa, Indonesia           1883                 18
  Long Valley, California     pre-historic        500 - 600
  Yellowstone, Wyoming        pre-historic           2400
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>In this example we use space characters to make the first column left
justified and the other 2 columns center-justified. The dashes are used
to highlight the column headings.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Reload</B> in your web browser.
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web page with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut9_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
web page was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor. If the columns are not aligned, then
it is likely that you are missing or have too many space characters.

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How does the <TT>preformat</TT> tag change the way that a web browser
interprets HTML?
<li>In what other situations might you use this tag?
</ol>

<H3>More Information</H3>
You can still use HTML tags inside text that is marked by the <TT>preformat</TT> tag.
For example we can add a hypertext link and some style tags:
<pre>

lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21get.html">download a copy</a> now. Also, you may want to first look at the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/test.html">test</A> page to see of your browser supports the tags used in this lesson</b>
<p>
Tables were introduced into HTML 3.0 and further enhanced by <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> to add another dimension to web page design. They provide a structure for organizing other HTML elements into "grids" on the page. One of the more obvious uses of tables is when you have to format... columnar tables of text! But, tables also open up the door for many other page layout options.
<p>
The HTML for tables can look very complex- but we will start simple and build up some tables for our <I>Volcano Web</I> lesson.
<p>
For starters, keep in mind this concept:
<blockquote><B>Tables start being built from the top left, them across the columns of the first row, then to the second row, across the columns of the second row...</B>
<pre>
      --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt; 
      ___________________________|
      |
      --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;  --&gt;</pre>

We will call each grid in a table a <i>cell</i>
</blockquote>

<H2>Basic Table Tags</H2>
The HTML for the basic table structure is shown below well as how the table it describes will look:
<table cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>&lt;table border&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 1 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 1 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 1 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
</td>
<td valign=middle>
<table border>
  <tr>
  <td>Row 1 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 1 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 1 col 3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Row 2 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 2 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 2 col 3</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td>Row 3 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 3 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 3 col 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</table>

The <TT>border</TT> attribute in the <TT>&lt;table&gt;</TT> tag instructs the browser to draw the grid lines around the table. Note how each row is defined by <B>T</B>able <B>R</B>ow tags <TT>&lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;</TT> and then cells in each row are defined by <B>T</B>able <B>D</B>ata <TT>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;</TT> tags. 
Each <TT>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;</tt> tag can contain any type of HTML tag we have used in this tutorial- headers, styled text, hypertext links, inline graphics, etc. Within this tag you can uses several attributes to control the alignment of items in a single cell:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Horizontal Alignment</th>
<th>Vertical Alignment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<ul>
<li><TT>&lt;td align=left&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to the left side of the cell (this is the default setting)
<li><TT>&lt;td align=right&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to the right side of the cell
<li><TT>&lt;td align=center&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to center of the cell
</ul>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ul>
<li><TT>&lt;td valign=top&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to the top of the cell
<li><TT>&lt;td valign=bottom&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to the bottom of the cell
<li><TT>&lt;td valign=middle&gt;</TT> aligns all elements to the middle of the cell (this is the default setting)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
You can combine these attributes:
<pre>  &lt;td align=left valign=bottom&gt;</pre>
This HTML will produce a cell with items aligned along the left and bottom of the cell.

<H2>Rows and Columns</H2>
The table above is pretty simple and square- three rows by three columns. 
Look what we can do if using the <TT>colspan</TT> and <TT>rowspan</TT> attributes in the <TT>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;</TT> tags.

<table cellpadding=8>
<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=2>
<pre>&lt;table border&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 1 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
<B>  &lt;td align=center colspan=2&gt;
   Row 1 col 2-3&lt;/td&gt;</B>
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
</td>

<td>
<br>** Note the attribute for the second cell of the first
row- it <b>spans</b> 2 columns. We have also aligned the
text in the center of this cell.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<table border>
  <tr>
  <td>Row 1 col 1</td>
 <td align=center colspan=2>
   Row 1 col 2-3</td>  
   </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Row 2 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 2 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 2 col 3</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td>Row 3 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 3 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 3 col 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Okay, now that we have had a cell span two columns- lets make a cell that spans two rows. Remember to follow the HTML as it builds from the top left across, then down, then across...

<table cellpadding=8>
<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=2>
<pre>&lt;table border&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 1 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td align=center colspan=2&gt;
   Row 1 col 2-3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
<B>  &lt;td valign=top rowspan=2&gt;
  Row 2 col 2&lt;/td&gt;
</B>  &lt;td&gt;Row 2 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Row 3 col 3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
</td>

<td>
<table border>
  <tr>
  <td>Row 1 col 1</td>
  <td align=center colspan=2>
   Row 1 col 2-3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Row 2 col 1</td>
  <td valign=top rowspan=2>
   Row 2 col 2</td>
  <td>Row 2 col 3</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td>Row 3 col 1</td>
  <td>Row 3 col 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
There is still quite a bit more to cover, but let's stop looking at these boring examples and work on our web page...

<H2>A Data Table</H2>
Our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/intro.html">Introduction</A> page contains a table ("Volumes of Some Well Known Eruptions") that we first created in <A HREF="tut9.html">lesson 9</A> using the preformat tags <TT>&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</TT>. We will now enhance that chart using a table tags.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the <TT>intro.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Delete everything inside and including the <TT>&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</TT>  tags.
<li>In the same place put:
<pre>
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Eruption&lt;/th&gt;                     
&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;           
&lt;th&gt;Volume in km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Paricutin, Mexico&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1943&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mt. Vesuvius, Italy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;79 A.D.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mount St. Helens,&lt;br&gt;Washington&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1980&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Krakatoa, Indonesia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1883&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Long Valley, California&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;pre-historic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;&gt;450 &amp; &lt;700&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yellowstone, Wyoming&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;pre-historic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;400&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Look at the HTML for the first row. The <B>T</B>able <B>H</B>eader tags <TT>&lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt;</TT> function exactly like the <TT>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;</TT> tags except that any text is automatically made bold and all items are automatically centered.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Load</B> into your web browser. You can compare your attempt with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/table1.html">sample</A> of how the table should look at this point. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: The table may not be completely distinct as it sits on a solid black background.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>Now let's add some more things to our table.
<li>Some browsers allow you to specify other settings for the lines that make up the table. These are the attributes for the table tag:
<pre>  &lt;table border=X cellpadding=Y cellspacing=Z&gt;</pre>
where X is the width (in pixels) of the outer border of the table. The attribute 
<TT>cellpadding</TT> specifies how much empty "space" exists between items in the cells and the walls of the cells- high values for Y will make the cells larger ("padding" the cell). The attribute 
<TT>cellspacing</TT> specifies (in pixels) the width the inner lines that divide the cells.
<p>
Modify your <TT>&lt;table&gt;</TT> tag to read:
<pre>  &lt;table border=3 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=8&gt;</pre>
<li>The <TT>&lt;caption&gt;</TT> tag places a string of text (centered to the width of the table) as a title/caption for the table. Modify the lines of your table to read:
<pre>  &lt;table border=3 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=8&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;
  Volumes of Some Well-Known 
  Volcanic Eruptions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;</pre>
You can include and HTML inside the <TT>&lt;caption&gt;</TT> tag; just makes sure that it is <b>within</b> the <TT>&lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;</TT> tags.
<p>
<li>And just for fun, let's color the text in the <TT>&lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt;</TT> tags an orange color (for more on coloring text, see <A HREF="tut19.html">lesson 19</A>). Modify the HTML for the first row to look like:
<pre>  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Eruption&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;                     
  &lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Date&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;           
  &lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Volume in km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;</pre>
<li>And let's move that table to the center of the page. If your web browser supports the <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tag, then just surround the table with these tags. For more on text alignment, see <A HREF="tut20.html">lesson 20.</A><p>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> into your web browser. You can compare your attempt with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/table2.html">sample</A> of how the table should look at this point. Pretty good, eh?
<p>
<li>Finally, we will add a column to the left side- we want to show the grouping of historic volcanic eruptions (the first four rows) and the pre-historic ones (the last two rows). We now add an empty cell by adding <TT>&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</TT> to the first row- the reason why we did this should be come clear as we build this new column in the next few steps.
<pre>&lt;tr&gt;
<B>&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</B>
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Eruption&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;                     
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Date&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;           
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;Volume in km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;</pre>
<li>We go to the first row, and add a first cell that spans the next 4 rows:
<pre>
&lt;tr&gt;
<B>&lt;td rowspan=4&gt;
&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;
&lt;i&gt;eruptions&lt;br&gt;
observed&lt;br&gt;
by humans&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</B>
&lt;td&gt;Paricutin, Mexico&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1943&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;1.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We have added some <<TT>br&gt;</TT> tags so that this first column does not become to wide. You might want to investigate for yourselves the effect of omitting these tags.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li>And in the fifth row, we add a cell that spans the next 2 rows:
<pre>
&lt;tr&gt;
<B>&lt;td rowspan=2&gt;
&lt;font color=#EE8844&gt;
&lt;i&gt;inferred&lt;br&gt;
by study&lt;br&gt;
of deposits&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</B>
&lt;td&gt;Long Valley, California&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;pre-historic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=center&gt;&gt;450 &amp; &lt;700&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; </pre>

<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> again into your web browser. You can compare your attempt with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/intro.html">sample</A> of how the table should look at this point. This is all we will add to this table.
</ol>


<H2>Invisible or Phantom Tables</H2>
The table with borders is useful but other times we want to create a grid-like layout that does not have the borders. We like to call these "Phantom" tables because to the reader it may not be obvious that they are looking at a table!
<p>
A Phantom table is built in the same manner as the table we built above except the <B>&lt;table&gt;</B> tag looks like:
<pre>  &lt;table&gt;</pre>
or
<pre>  &lt;table border=0&gt;</pre>
On some browsers, just omitting the border attribute will cause it to display a table without any lines marking the cells. On other browsers, you will have to set the border to 0 pixels for the same effect. 
<p>
If you look at the very top of this page, the top most part is actually a Phantom table that contains in one of its cells a second table with borders! However, we are jumping ahead. For our example, we will reformat the file <B>usa.html</B> (Volcanoes in the USA) into a two column format. Rather than having  page-wide paragraphs <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/usa.html">stacked vertically on the page</A>, we will put them side by side like this sketch:<p>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td>XXXXX<br>
<font size=-1><B>[title]</B></font></td>
</td><td>XXXXX
<br>
<font size=-1><B>[title]</B></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>xxxxx xxxxx xxxx 
xxx xx xxxxx xx xx
 xxxx xxxxx xxxxx</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<pre>  xxx xx x xxxx 
xxx xx x x xx xx
xxxx xxxxx xx
x xxxxx xxx xxxxx</pre></font>
</td>
<td valign=bottom>
<pre><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/blah">_______
| img |
|     |
|_____|</A></pre></td>
<td valign=bottom>
<font size=-1><B>[image<br>link<br> to <br>big<br> image]</B></font>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=3 align=right> <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/blah">xxx xx xx</A><br>
<font size=-1><B>[hypertext link to big image]</B></font></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Note that the right hand column also has an adjacent picture that is a hyperlink to a full screen image (see <A HREF="tut8e.html">lesson 8e</A>)
<ol>
<li>Open up the file <TT>usa.html</TT> in your text editor.
<li>Find the section that looks like:
<pre>
&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, 
this quiet mountain in Washington provided 
&lt;a href=&quot;msh.html&quot;&gt;detailed observations&lt;/a&gt; on
the mechanics of highly explosive eruptions.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;Long Valley&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This field seismometer measures earthquakes 
associated with subsurface volcanic forces and 
may help to predict future events. It sits on a 
plateau known as the &quot;Volcanic Tableland&quot; formed 
by a major eruption  600,000 years ago.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;../pictures/seismo.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/stamp.gif&quot;&gt; 
-- [full size image] --&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

and replace it with the following HTML:

<pre>&lt;table cellpadding=6&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;Long Valley&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Look carefully at the HTML here. We actually are using a 3 column table- the first paragraph (Mount St Helens) becomes the left column.

<H2>Splitting a Long List</H2>
Another handy use for invisible tables is to transform a long list of items (created with the <TT>list</TT> tags, see <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A>). Lists grow downward on a page, and can waste valuable real estate on the right side of the page.
<p>
The effect is to transform a list:
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<th>Long Linear List</th>
<th></th>
<th>Column 1</th>
<th>Column 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; xxxxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxxx xxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxx  x xxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxx xxxxx
&lt;li&gt; xx x  xxxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxx xx
&lt;li&gt; xxxx x
&lt;li&gt; xxx  x xxx
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top><font size=+3><br><br><b> to </b></font>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; xxxxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxxx xxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxx  x xxxx
&lt;li&gt; xxx xxxxx
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; xxx xx
&lt;li&gt; xxxx x
&lt;li&gt; xxx  x xxx
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

  <BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We simply have taken one <TT>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</TT> list and broke it into two
  complete lists, each in the cell of an invisible table with one row and two columns.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> in your web browser. You can compare your attempt with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/proj.html">sample</A> of how the table should look at this point.
</ol>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. Tables quickly become complicated, so double-check that you have defined the rows and columns correctly. 


<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>What is the order in which a web browser interprets the elements of
a table tag?
<li>What is the difference between <TT>&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;th&gt;...&lt;/th&gt;</TT> tags?
<li>How do you create a table that has no visible margins?
<li>Where does the <TT>colspan=X</TT> attribute go? What does it do?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Look at your own web pages and find a place where a table may give you a better page layout. Or, add a chart or list of data to your web pages and use a table to format it.

<h2>Coming Next....</h2>
Even <b>more</b> things to throw into your lists and toss around your images

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
The background of your page should be just that- in the background. As we add different colors or even patterns, keep in mind that it should not interfere with the readability of text. 
For the pages of this tutorial, we have used a solid white color that makes for a clean and non-interfering (even if not dramatic) backdrop. 
<p>
With some modifications to the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag (introduced way back in <A HREF="tut1.html">lesson 1</A>), you can add a solid color background to your web page. But before we show you how to do the fancy color stuff, we must first talk about RGB color values and their "hexadecimal" representation.

<H2>"Hex-Dec" and Color Basics</H2>
In a web browser, you have at your disposal 256 system colors to color text and backgrounds. Each color is identified by its 
<font color="#FF0000"><B>Red</B></font>-
<font color="#005500"><B>Green</B></font>-
<font color="#0000FF"><B>Blue</B></font> (RGB) values, three numbers that range from 0 to 255, each which represents the intensity of the <font color="#FF0000"><B>Red</B></font>, <font color="#005500"><B>Green</B></font>, or <font color="#0000FF"><B>Blue</B></font> component of the desired color. Maximum values of all three (R=255, G=255, B=255) produce the color <B>white</B> and minimal values (R=0, G=0, B=0) produce <B>black</B>. All other colors are represented by different of RGB triplets.
<p>
Here is the tricky part. Rather than identifying a 
<font color=#6699FF><B>color</B></font> as something like <TT>"102,153,255"</TT> each number is converted from base 10 (normal everyday numbers, digits from <TT>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</TT>) representation to hexadecimal, base 16 (digits from <TT>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F</TT>). Why? Hexadecimal is easier and more efficient to understand by computers. So for the color example above, we would write in hexadecimal as <font color=#6699FF><TT><B>"6699FF"</B></TT></font>. 
In this example, <TT>"66"</TT> is the <font color="#FF0000"><B>Red</B></font> value, <TT>"99"</TT> the <font color="#005500"><B>Green</B></font>, and <TT>"FF"</TT> the <font color="#0000FF"><B>Blue</B></font>.
<p>
Here are some hexadecimal examples of different colors:
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=10>
<tr>
<td><font color=#FFCCCC><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>FFCCCC</TT></td>
<td><font color=#3300FF><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>3300FF</TT></td>
<td><font color=#33FF66><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>33FF66</TT></td>
<td><font color=#AA0000><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>AA0000</TT></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color=#663300><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>663300</TT></td>
<td><font color=#9900FF><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>9900FF</TT></td>
<td><font color=#000077><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>000077</TT></td>
<td><font color=#FFFF00><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>FFFF00</TT></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color=#EEEEEE><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>EEEEEE</TT></td>
<td><font color=#888888><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>888888</TT></td>
<td><font color=#444444><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>444444</TT></td>
<td><font color=#000000><B><TT>xx oo xx </TT></B></font><TT>000000</TT></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Now, don't panic about having do a bunch of numerical conversions! There are many tools that will let you click on a color and they will provide the hexadecimal representation. For example, try the <A HREF="http://www.infocom.net/~bbs/cgi-bin/colorEditor.cgi">Color Editor for HTML 3.0 Backgrounds</A>. Other color tools are available from <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Page_Design_and_Layout/Color_Information/">Yahoo</A>.

<H2>Solid Color Backgrounds</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: You may want to first try a <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/test1.html">test</A> to see if your browser supports solid color backgrounds.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

For our <TT>Volcano Web,</TT> the first thing we will do is add a color background to the <TT>index.html</TT> file. 
The HTML format for adding a solid color background involves modifying the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to read:
<pre>    &lt;body bgcolor=#XXXXXX&gt;</pre>
where <TT>XXXXXX</TT> is the hexadecimal representation (indicated by the # sign in front of it) of the desired color. 
<p>
If you recall, the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/lava.gif">image</A> we use for the opening has pictures of volcanoes on a black background- so if we were to use the same black color for the background of the web page, the picture would merge well into our page:
<ol>
<li>Open the <TT>index.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Find the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag and change it to:
<pre>    &lt;body bgcolor=#000000&gt;</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Load</B> your HTML file in your web browser
</ol>
If you did things correctly, your browser should have changed the background to  a solid black. <B>But you may have noticed that you cannot see your text!</B> Why? Well, the default color for text is also black, so you know have black text on a black background! Fortunately, we have some other options to add to the body tag to color the text and the hypertext items:

<pre>    &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#XXXXXX TEXT=#XXXXXX LINK=#XXXXXX VLINK=#XXXXXX&gt;</pre>
where the XXXXXX values will determine:
<UL>
	<LI><TT>BGCOLOR</TT> = the color of the background (default is <font color=#777777><B>grey</B></font>)
	<LI><TT>TEXT </TT>= the color of normal body text (default is <B>black</B>)
	<LI><TT>LINK</TT> = the color of an item that is a hypertext link (default is <font color=#0000EE><B>blue</B></font>)
	<LI><TT>VLINK</TT> = the color of a hypertext item recently visited (default is <font color=#660099><B>purple</B></font>)
</UL>
<p>
You can now add some of these other color values by changing the <BODY> tag to read:
<pre>  &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#000000 TEXT=#EEEEBB LINK=#33CCFF VLINK=#CC0000&gt;</pre>
This will provide a <B>black</B> background, <font color=#FFFF66><B>yellow</B></font> text, <font color=#33CCFF><B>light blue</B></font> hypertext, and <font color=#CC0000><B>red</B></font> visited hypertext.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: the order of the items in the &lt;BODY&gt; tag does not matter</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
You should now modify the &lt;BODY&gt; tags in all of your HTML files (fast and easy to do by copy and pasting the above example for the new <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag).

<H2>Textured Backgrounds</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: You may want to first try a <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/test2.html">test</A> to see if your browser supports textured  backgrounds.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
Solid colors add some variety to web pages- but you can go even farther by adding a textured background. You use a small image file (GIF or JPEG) and the browser will "tile" the web page with repeated copies of the image. Some of the things you should keep in mind are:
<ul>
<li><b>file size:</b> Adding a background texture will require that an additional graphic file be downloaded. We suggest that the image files be less than 10k in size.
<li><b>readability:</b> Be selective! Many background texture files are more distracting for reading than enhancing. Try to use ones that are very light (with dark text) or very dark (with light text)- i.e select high contrast with the text.
<li><b>effect:</b> In the first web browsers that used backgrounds, the page would not appear until the background file was downloaded- this might mean for a slow connection, your reader might have to wait long for the background image to arrive before even seeing any content! However, later browsers download the background <b>last</b> so the page first is grey, then the text and graphics appear, and lastly the background arrives. REMEMBER! The load time for your pages will likely be slower (considerably for older modems) when your pages are read from a web server.
</ul>

In this part of the lesson, we will give you a chance to experiment with three different background images. The HTML format for adding a background image file is:
<pre>  &lt;body background=&quot;bgfile.gif&quot;&gt;</pre>
where <tt>bgfile.gif</tt> is the name of the image file (this can be a full URL or a relative file path- see <A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A>).
<p>
Below we list the names of three background files. You can download each one (if you do not know how to download graphics from a web page, please refer to our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/help-dl.html">help sheet</A>). You should put each graphic file in your <TT>pictures</TT> folder/directory in your web workspace:
<dl>
<dt><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/bg.gif">Blue Tile <TT>[bg.gif]</TT></A>
<dd>A square repeating pattern:<br>
HTML: <tt>&lt;body background=&quot;../pictures/bg.gif&quot;&gt;</tt><br>
<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/indexb1.html">Example</A> file with the Blue Tile background
<p>
<dt><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/vtext.gif">Volcano Text <TT>[vtext.gif]</TT></A>
<dd>Light grey large text:<br>
HTML: <tt>&lt;body background=&quot;../pictures/vtext.gif&quot;&gt;</tt><br>
<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/indexb2.html">Example</A> file with the Volcano Text background
<p>
<dt><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/paper.gif">Legal Paper <TT>[paper.gif]</TT></A>
<dd>Long strip of notebook paper<br>
HTML: <tt>&lt;body background=&quot;../pictures/paper.gif&quot;&gt;</tt><br>
<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/indexb3.html">Example</A> file with the Legal Paper background 
</dl>

You can also modify the text colors for your page as we did in the above example. For example, if we want <font color=#AA0000><b>RED</b></font> text for the Legal Paper background, we might write this HTML:
<pre>  &lt;body background=&quot;../pictures/paper.gif&quot; text=##AA0000&gt;</pre>
which gives us <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/indexb4.html">red text on yellow paper</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Many web browsers have the ability to change the default text colors- sometimes a user may have the preferences set for colors that will interfere with the ones you have selected. Therefore, we suggest when using any background tags (solid color or texture file) that you include the "normal" colors- black for text, blue for hypertext links, and purple for recent links:
<pre>  &lt;BODY TEXT=#FFFFFF VLINK=#660099 LINK=#0000EE&gt;</pre></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you are looking for some examples of background texture files, see 
<A HREF="http://the-tech.mit.edu/KPT/bgs.html">Kai's Power Tips Background Archives</A>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut16_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. We are going to keep the sample files with the solid black colors that we added in the early part of this lesson

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How do you add a solid color background to your web page?
<li>Why are the color codes written in cryptic code like <TT>#EE66CC</TT> ?
<li>How do you color the text of a web page?
<li>What is the difference between
<pre>  &lt;body bgcolor=#FFFFFF&gt;</pre>
and
<pre>  &lt;body background="tiles.gif"&gt;</pre>
?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Add a solid color background or a texture file background to your web page(s). 
Ask some other people if they find that the text is suitably readable with the background elements you have chosen.

<h1>3. Headings- Six Levels Deep</h1>
As you see in this web page,  the section headings ("Headings- Six
Levels Deep", "Objectives", "Lesson", "HTML Headings" ...) appear as
different sizes and, perhaps, different colors and fonts. HTML has
codes for designating headings in six levels of significance. 
Your browser determines the exact font and size for display.
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the different levels of headings in HTML and the tags
associated with them.
<li>Place different level headings within your HTML document and
view the changes within your web browser.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
<h3>HTML Headings</h3>
Headings are achieved in HTML by "tagging" certain chunks of text
with heading tags. The format for a HTML heading tag is:

     &lt;hN&gt;Text to Appear in Heading&lt;/hN&gt;
</pre>
N is a number from 1 to 6 identifying the heading size.


Here are some examples of different heading sizes:
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
<p>

Heading levels range from level 1 (Most Important) to level 6 (Least
Important).  Like an outline, your heading levels should have
logical, consistent order and be parallel.

<h3>Placing HTML Headings in Your Document</h3>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut3get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Re-open your workspace (if not already opened).
<li>Go to the text editor window.
<li>Open the HTML text file you created in lesson 2,
<code>"Volc.html"</code>. 
<li>First, we will use the &lt;h1&gt; tag to display the title as the
biggest header, <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT>. Enter the following above the 
existing body text and <B>after</B> the <TT>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;</TT> tags:
<pre>
          &lt;h1&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

<li>Below the text already entered, create other headings for future
sections of your <i>Volcano Web</i> page. <p>
Enter the
following headings inside the body of your web page
(Note that some are <TT>H3</TT> and others are <TT>H2</TT> tags):
<pre>
          &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;Long Valley&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars?&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;Research Project&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>
<li>Save changes in your text editor.
<li>Return to your web browser, <b>Open</b> and <b>Reload</b> the HTML file.
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Note that on the computer you are using now, you can use the
settings of the web browser  to define the fonts and/or size of
the headings. For example, on one computer you could have
a browser display <em>h1</em> tags as Times font and 36 point;
<em>h2</em> tags as Helvetica font and 24 point, etc. 
HTML codes designate only the headers are of a
certain type (h1 to h6); how it is displayed is controlled by the
user of the web browser. </b></BLOCKQUOTE>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your work to this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut3_ex.html">sample</a>. If some
of your headings do not appear correct, be sure to check that the
starting tag and ending tags have the same heading level.<p> 

As an
optional exercise, take a look at what happens when you make a
typographical error. Open your HTML document in the text editor and
delete the slash (/) in the <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt> tag, after
the header <B>Volcano Web</B>:
<PRE>
          &lt;h1&gt;Volcano Web&lt;h1&gt;
[missing "/" -----------^^^]
</PRE>     
Save the changes and reload into
your web browser. Without the correct ending of the <tt>h1</tt> tag, your web browser 
interprets all of the succeeding text as part of that header! After
trying this you should go back to your document and re-insert the
slash in the correct spot.

<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are the different levels of headings in HTML?
<li>What are the tags associated with these different levels?
<li>What steps did you use in placing headings in your HTML document?
<li>What happens if you forget a slash at the end of a header tag?
</ol>
<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Add at least three headers of different levels to your own WWW 
document.

<h1>5. Doing it with <b><i>Style</b></i></h1>
Just like a word processor, HTML can tell a web browser to display
certain portions of text in <i>Italic</i> or <b>Bold</b> Style
or even a <i><b>combination</i></b>. 
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the HTML tags for the text styles: <B>bold</B>, <I>italic</I>,
and typewriter <tt>(mono-spaced)</tt>.
<li>Enter text in your HTML document in these different text styles
and view the changes within your web browser.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
<h3>HTML Style Tags</h3>
HTML offers several tags for text style attributes. Just remember to
be judicious and consistent in the use of styles; too many can make
the text uncomfortable to read...
<p>
<b>Here are the basic tags for stylized text:</b>
<dl>
<dt> <tt>&lt;b&gt;Make this text Bold...&lt;/b&gt;</tt>
<dd><b>...And it looks like this</b><p>
<dt> <tt>&lt;i&gt;Make this text Italic...&lt;/i&gt;</tt>
<dd><i>...And it looks like this...</i><p>
<dt> <tt>&lt;tt&gt;Make this text typewriter...&lt;/tt&gt;</tt>
<dd><tt>...And it looks like this</tt></dl><p>
<b>Here is an example of how to combine style tags:</b>
<dl>
<dt> <tt>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make this text Bold and
Italic....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</tt>
<dd><b><i>...And it looks like this</i></b> 
<p>Note how the combined tags are correctly nested, the italic tags
are both within the bold tags.
</dl><p>
<b>Furthermore, you can also add style to the text that appears in
headings:</b>
<dl>
<dt><tt>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;New&lt;/i&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;Improved!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</tt></dl>

<h2 align=center><i>New</i> and <tt>Improved!</tt></h2> 
Note how the different style tags are opened and closed around the
words they style and how the heading tags surround the whole heading.


<h3>Entering <i>Styled</i> Text in Your HTML Document</h3>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut5get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
Follow these steps to apply style tags to your HTML document.
<ol>
<li>Re-open your workspace (if not already opened).
<li>Return to your HTML document, <tt>"Volc.html"</tt>, in the
text editor.
<li>Find the word "volcano" in the first sentence of the
Introduction. We are going to make this bold to highlight an
important word.
<li>Insert the tags to make this word appear as bold text:
<pre>
          &lt;b&gt;volcano&lt;/b&gt;
</pre>
<li>Now we will modify the second paragraph with the
<tt>bold</tt> and <TT>italic</TT> tags to emphasize a word. Enter <tt>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;</tt> tags
around the word <tt>billion</tt> so this section looks like:
<pre>
          &lt;p&gt;
          Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long 
          before humans. Compare the history of human beings, 
          a few million years in the making, to that of the Earth, 
          over four &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;billion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; years in the making.
</pre>

<li>Finally, we will use the <tt>typewriter</tt> tag to indicate a special word. Under the
<b>Volcano Terminology</b> heading, enter the following:
<pre>
          The study of volcanoes, or &lt;tt&gt;Volcanology&lt;/tt&gt;,
          includes many odd terms.
</pre>

<li><b>Save</b> in the text editor and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>
<hr>

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Look at an <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut5_ex.html">example</a> that shows these
changes. It is important when using  the style tags to properly terminate
the tag(s) with proper <tt>&lt;/&gt;</tt> tag. Otherwise, all
succeeding text will inherit this text style. It can look bizarre. </b>
<H2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are HTML style tags?
<li>What are the different tags used for different styles of text?
<li>What steps did you use in entering styled text into your HTML
document?
<li>Extra Credit*- How can these styles be useful in creating a
web page or lesson?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Try using the style tags for <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and
<tt>typewriter</tt> to the text of your own web page. See if you
can successfully combine styles

<h1>12. Address Footers and E-Mail Links</h1>
Hey! You created a snazzy web page-- autograph it with a footer! Let people
on the web send you an e-mail message right from your web page!

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>insert a stylized footer at the bottom of a page
<li>create a hypertext link that will send an e-mail message
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut12get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
A worthwhile feature of web pages is  a "footer"
at the bottom of a page that provides information about the author and the document,
maybe the last date it was modified,
as well as a means to send the author a message by e-mail. The is the place
for the <tt>address</tt> tag which usually does no more then stylizing a block
of text in italic and offsetting it to a new line. 
<p>
Stylistically, it is good to make these brief, informative, and consistent
between different web pages. Some useful information to include is:
<ul>
<li>Title or subject of the current page
<li>Date it was created/updated
<li>Copyright if appropriate (or even meaningful?)
<li>Name and e-mail for the web page author
<li>Name and hypertext link to affiliation/organization
</ul>
<P>
As examples, see the footers at the bottom of every web page in this tutorial.
In composing your own style, take a look at other web pages for ideas. <I><B>Imitation
still is a very high form of flattery!</B></I>
<p>
The HTML format for the <tt>address</tt> tag might look like:
<PRE>
    &lt;address&gt;
      text text text text text text text text text 
      text text text text text text text text text 
    &lt;/address&gt;    
</PRE>

Note that all other HTML inside the <tt>address</tt> tag is legal, so we might
modify it with bold tags, line breaks, and a hypertext link tag:
<PRE>
    &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Page Title&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/address&gt;

<p>
Now, suppose someone was reading your page and wanted to send you a comment on
how nice your page looked. They would have to write down your e-mail address,
launch another program, and send you a message. Wouldn't it be great if
you could send email from your Web browser? Well, most web browsers now can!
<p>
The way to do this is to create a hypertext link with the <tt>mailto</tt> 
type in the URL (see <A HREF="tut8b.html">lesson 8b</A> for a refresher). Create
an email hypertext link like this:
<pre>
    &lt;a href="mailto:levine@maricopa.edu"&gt;send an e-mail to alan&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

When the text <tt>send an e-mail to alan</tt> is clicked, the web browser will 
bring up a screen where you can compose a message and send it to me. Try it! Send me a note!
<a href="mailto:levine@maricopa.edu">send an e-mail to alan</a>
<p>
Note that you can have any text (or graphic) 
act as the hypertext link. So in the previous example, we would modify the HTML to
have the internet address create the link for e-mail.

<PRE>
    &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Page Title&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
    Last Updated February 31, 1999 &lt;br&gt;
    Web Page by Alan Levine &lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:levine@maricopa.edu&quot;&gt;(levine@maricopa.edu)&lt;/A&gt; &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/&quot;&gt;Maricopa Community Colleges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/address&gt;   
</PRE>

which should produce:
<p>
<hr>
    <address>
    <b>Page Title</b> <br>
    Last Updated February 31, 1999 <br>

    <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/">Maricopa Community Colleges</a><br>
    </address>    
<hr>
<p>
And finally, we recommend that you also put in the footer the URL for the 
page. Why? What if someone prints out your web page but does not
bookmark or note its URL? This provides a handy reference. Just modify the above example
(note how this HTML is <b>below</b> the <TT>&lt;address&gt;...&lt;/address&gt;</TT> tag:
<pre>    &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Page Title&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/address&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;tt&gt;URL: http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;
    </pre> 
which should produce:

Now it is time to add a footer to your HTML file. For this example, we assume
you are "Lorrie Lava" a staff Volcanologist at Big University (feel free
to put your own information in place of what is below):
<ol>
<li>Open the HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>At the bottom of the document (but above the &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; tags), 
add the following:
<PRE>
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;address&gt;&lt;B&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/B&gt; &lt;br&gt;
created by Lorrie Lava, &lt;A HREF="mailto:lava@pele.bigu.edu"&gt;lava@pele.bigu.edu&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Volcanic Studies, &lt;A HREF="http://www.bigu.edu/"&gt;Big University&lt;/A&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;TT&gt;last modified: April 1, 1995&lt;/TT&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;URL: http://www.bigu.edu/web/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We've used several HTML tags that have been covered in previous
lessons. Also note the extra &lt;p&gt; tag at the bottom; this makes 
sure the last line of text is always visible.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Reload</B> the HTML file.
</ol>

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your document with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut12_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
document was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor.

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>What does an <tt>address</tt> tag do?
<li>Does an <tt>address</tt> tag have to be at the bottom?
<li>How do you create a tag that will e-mail to you? to someone else?

</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Add an address footer and e-mail links to your own HTML documents.

<h1>13. You can Blockquote Me on That!</h1>
Yet another simple HTML tag for re-arranging your text:
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>"What is going on here?"</B> asked the <TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> 
tag to the <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tags.
They replied, "We are not sure, but you are very different from us!"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Insert a block of text that is indented from the body text
<li>Apply style tags within blockquote text
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut13get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
In traditional writing, quotations of three or more sentences are set off from
the main text as an idented block of text. HTML also includes this capability
via the <TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;....&lt;/&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> tag:
<pre>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This is a long quotation from a very famous person. Since it is so long
and interesting, it should really be set off from the rest of the text.
This indicates clearly that the quote is from someone other than the writer."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</pre>

which yields:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"This is a long quotation from a very famous person. Since it is so long
and interesting, it should really be set off from the rest of the text.
This indicates clearly that the quote is from someone other than the writer."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

Note that we can apply any and all HTML we have learned so far <B>inside</B> of the
<TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> tags:
<blockquote>
<hr>
<H2>A Manifesto</H2>
This is a <B>long</B> quotation from a 
<A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/alan/">very famous person</A>. 
Since it is so long and interesting, it should really be
<pre>     set off</pre>
from the rest of the text.
<p>
<I>This indicates</I>:
<ul> 
<li>clearly that 
<li>the quote is from 
<li>someone other than the writer.
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's add a blockquote to the introduction of our Volcano web page. We will
use blockquote from the Roman naturalist, Pliny, who witnessed the eruption
of the volcano Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

<ol>
<li>Open the HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>Under the <TT>&lt;h1&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/h1&gt;</TT> heading, add the following:
<pre>
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
  &quot;Nature raves savagely, threatening the lands&quot;
  &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   -- &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://magic.geol.ucsb.edu/~fisher/pliny.htm&quot;&gt;
  Pliny the Elder&lt;/A&gt;, who died of asphyxiation after 
  observing the destruction of Pompeii by the
  79 A.D. eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
  &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: See how we have used a combination of the bold and italic style tags
(see <A HREF="tut5.html">Lesson 5</A>) to highlight the quote. The citation 
is forced to a new line
with the <TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tag (see <A HREF="tut4.html">Lesson 4</A>). 
We have also hyper linked "Pliny the Elder" to another web site that contains
more information about Pliny and his observations.
<p>
See also how the <TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> tag forces a paragraph break
above and below the block of text.
<p>
And finally, these NOTES (like this one) we have used through the tutorial have made use
of the <TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> tag!</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Reload</B> the HTML file.
</ol>


<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web page with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut13_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
document was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor.

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>What does the <tt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> tag do?
<li>Why don't you need a <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag before a blockquote?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Experiment with the <tt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> tag in your own web page.
Do not just think in terms of using it only for quotations. The tag can
be effective for adding some variety to your web page layout. The  <tt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> tag is one way 
to avoid having many pages full
worth of plain text paragraphs.
<p>
Remember that while HTML may
be limited in terms of control over page layout, there is a great deal of
potential in creatively use of the number of tags.

<h1>10. Special Characters</h1>
How do you say...
<h2 align=center>&gt;&gt;&gt;&AElig; &ntilde; &THORN;&oacute;&szlig;&yuml;  ? </h2> 

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE:If the above characters do not display various accents or diacritical
markers, then your web browser does not support the 
<A HREF="http://www.uni-passau.de/~ramsch/iso8859-1.html">ISO character
set.</A> You would likely want to skip this lesson</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Use the HTML codes for ISO Latin 1 characters to display accent marks for
non-English letters.
<li>Override the HTML use of &lt; and &gt; symbols when you need them in a document.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut10get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>

<H3>Accent Marks</H3>
Sometime you may need to use a special character in an HTML document, an accent
or diacritical mark. The ones that are recognized as known as 
<A HREF="http://www.uni-passau.de/~ramsch/iso8859-1.html">ISO</A>
These special characters are marked in HTML as:
<pre>
   &amp;xxxx;
</pre>
where XXXX is the code name for the special character.
<p>
For example, in the "Terminology" section of our Volcano lesson,
we want to add an explanation of a technical term that was used to describe a
particular type of volcanic flow. This term <B>nuee ardente</B> is from the
French term for "glowing cloud";  
but to use the proper spelling we need an "acute" accent, so that the word appears as
<B>nu&eacute;e ardente</B>.  In this case, we replace the first <B>e</B> in <B>nuee</B> with
the HTML for the acute accented "e" <B>&amp;eacute;</B>:
<pre>
     nu&amp;eacute;e ardente 
</pre>
For reference, see the
list of special <A HREF="http://www.uni-passau.de/~ramsch/iso8859-1.html">ISO characters.</A>
<p>
Now we will add a sentence to our HTML document that uses an accented letter:
<ol>
<li>Open the HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>Under the list of terms of the Volcanology Terminology section enter the text:
<pre>
  The term &lt;I&gt;nu&amp;eacute;e ardente,&lt;/I&gt; or 
  "glowing cloud" was first used by La Croix (1904)
  in his description of the volcanic flows he observed in 
  the 1902 eruption of Mt Pel&amp;eacute;e, a historically 
  active volcano on the island of Martinique.
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We have applied the acute accent 
mark for two "e" letters in this sentence. It may look strange! 
Be sure that you replace the letter with the sequence that displays the same
letter with the accent mark.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Reload</B> the HTML file.
</ol>
<H3>HTML Escape Sequences</H3>
The HTML for the accent mark is an example of the more general class of
tags known as <b>escape sequences</b>. In entering HTML so far, you may have
wondered what you do when you need to use a &lt; (less-than) or a
&gt; (greater-than) sign? These two characters, plus the &amp; (ampersand) have
special meaning in HTML and cannot be used as typed. Instead, use the 
<I>escape sequences:</I>
<pre>
   &amp;lt;  is used for &lt;
   &amp;gt;  is used for &gt; 
   &amp;amp; is used for &amp;
</pre>

Now let's apply one of these symbols in our Volcano lesson. In the 
<A HREF="tut9.html">back: </A>, we added a table that lists 
several volcanoes and how much material
was erupted from each. Let's say one of the values (500-600) for Long Valley 
is not very accurate (often such values are estimates), and we would like the
entry to read &gt;450 &amp; &lt;700. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Open the HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>Under the heading of <B>Volumes of Some Well-Known Volcanic Eruptions</B>,
find the line for Long Valley in our table:
<pre>
  Long Valley, California     pre-historic        500 - 600
</pre>
and change it to:
<pre>
  Long Valley, California     pre-historic       &amp;gt;450 &amp;amp; &amp;lt;700
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Although we are using the escape sequences within a preformatted
text, note how a web browser properly interprets and displays the 
special characters. The escape sequences can thus be used in all portions
of an HTML document including headings and anchor links.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Reload</B> the HTML file.   
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your document with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut10_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
document was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor. Be sure that you have correctly
bracketed the escape sequences with the &amp; and ; characters.
<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>In HTML, what is the correct way to display a German umlaut (&uuml;)?
<li>What happens if you do not use an escape sequence for &lt; and &gt; ?
<li>Why would you need a special escape sequence for the &amp; character?
</ol>


<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
In your own HTML document, add a foreign word that requires
a special accent or a mathematical expression that uses the
&lt; or &gt; symbol.

<h1>17. Don't Blink!</h1>
Are you trying to attract attention to your web pages? Rely on compelling <b>content</b> rather than <blink>cheap</blink> attention grabbers...

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will:
<ul>
<li>Never use the blink tag.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
When NetScape first unveiled their web browser they added a unique tag that would ostensibly draw attention to an important word or phrase- by causing it to flash on and off in the web page.
<p>
The dreaded blink tag:
<PRE>  &lt;blink&gt;Wow&lt;/blink&gt;</PRE>
is a sign that well-travelled web surfers take as <font size=+1><TT><B>"avoid this page- the person that wrote it just learned HTML from a bubble gum wrapper."</B></TT></font><p> Short of an extremely urgent reason to use it, avoid at all costs something that looks like:
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=16 cellspacing=12>
<tr>
<td align=center valign=middle>
<blink><font color=#BB0000 size=+3>T</font><font color=#BB0000 size=+2>h</font><font  color=#BB0000 size=+4><B>i</B></font><font color=#BB0000 size=+2>s</font></blink> <font size=+1><I>is</I></font> &nbsp; the <blink><font size=+4><B><I><font color=#DD11BB>HOTTEST</font></I></B></font></blink><blink><font color=#0033DD size=+3> place</font></blink> 
<font size=+2>ON THE </font>
<blink><font color=#0099DD size=+3>Web </font></blink>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Change the size of specific portions of text in a web page.
<li>Change the color of specific portions of text in a web page.
<li>Create superscripts and subscripts for text in a web page.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut18get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
With the HTML introduced by NetScape and HTML 3.0, you have some more options for formatting your text. Specifically, you can have different sized text as well as different colored text. When used judiciously, the text formatting can enhance the layout of a web page. When used with abandon, it can produce web pages that look like noise.
<p>
You can also now create superscript and subscripts used in mathematical expressions, chemical formulas, or as footnote markers.
<p>
In this lesson we will introduce you to these text features with some examples that you will use to modify your <I>Volcano Web</I> pages. You may want to first refer to the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut18_ex/test.html">font test page</A> to determine if your web browser supports the tags used in this lesson.

<H2>Font Size</H2>
The <TT>&lt;font&gt;..&lt;/font&gt;</TT> tag introduced by <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">NetScape</A> may be used to set the size of the font from 1 (smallest) to 7 (largest) with a size of 3 being the normal text size:
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Font Size = 1</font>
<li><font size=2>Font Size = 2</font>
<li><font size=3>Font Size = 3</font> -- normal size text
<li><font size=4>Font Size = 4</font>
<li><font size=5>Font Size = 5</font>
<li><font size=6>Font Size = 6</font>
<li><font size=7>Font Size = 7</font>
</ol>
Remember that the actual size will depend on the computer font the user has selected for their web browser.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note: If a web browser does not support the &lt;font&gt; tags, you may want to try the HTML 3.0 tags:
<pre>  &lt;BIG&gt;...&lt;/BIG&gt;
  &lt;SMALL&gt;...&lt;/SMALL&gt;</pre>
which gives you less font sizes to work with but can still be useful for those browsers. 
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
The format for the <TT>font</TT> size tag is:
<pre>    &lt;font size=N&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/font&gt;</pre>
where N=1 to 7. The font tag may be used in conjunction with other style tags (<A HREF="tut5.html">lesson 5</A>) or inside header tags (<A HREF="tut3.html">lesson 3</A>)
<p>
The other method for using the <TT>font</TT> tag is to provide a <b>relative</b> size change:
<pre>    &lt;font size=+1&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;font size=-2&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/font&gt;</pre>
i.e. where the <TT>+N</TT> or <TT>-N</TT> value provides the <b>offset</b> from the current font size. This is used with another tag:
<pre>    &lt;basefont size=5&gt;</pre>
which changes the <b>base font size</b> from its default value of 3 to some other value. You might do this in a web page that will mostly have text of a larger or smaller than standard font size. That way, if you need to adjust small portions of the page, you can use the relative font size tags shown above. 
<p>
The power of using relative font size tags (i.e. <TT>size=+2</TT>) over absolute size tags (i.e. <TT>size=5</TT>) is that we could easily shift the size of ALL text in that page by changing one instance of the <TT>&lt;basefont&gt;</TT> tag.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note: The <TT>&lt;basefont&gt;</TT> tag has no closing tag- it continues to be the base font size until another <TT>&lt;basefont&gt;</TT> tag occurs.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

We will first use the font size tag to modify the title in our opening page:
<ol>
<li>Open the <TT>index.html</TT> file in your text editor
<li>Previously we used an <TT>&lt;h1&gt;..&lt;/h1&gt;</TT> header tag to format the title of our page. We will now use some font size tags instead to create a mixed size title.
<p>
Change the line that reads:
<pre>  &lt;h1&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
to:
<pre>  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;font size=+4&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=+3&gt;OLCANO 
  WEB&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;</pre>
Look carefully what we have done- the first V is now increased in size by 4 units above the base value, and the other letters (now capitalized) are increased 3 units above base value. This provides the layout style of 
<font size=+1>S</font><font size=-1>MALL </font><font size=+1>C</font><font size=-1>APS</font>. Also note that we have added a<TT> &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</TT> tag to make the title stand out. And finally, because we are not using a header tag that carries a line break by default, we had to add a <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag above the title to force it to appear on a new line (we do not need one after because the next HTML is a &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; that carries its own line break- see <A HREF="tut13.html">lesson 13</A>)
<li>Next, we would like to make the quote from Pliny stand out a bit more, so we will raise it one font size:
<pre>  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&quot;Nature raves savagely, 
  threatening the lands&quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Load</B> into your web browser
</ol>

Before going on, we will use the font size tags to modify two other web pages in our work area. the page for <B><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut14_ex/usa.html">Volcanic Places in the USA</A></B> (file <TT>usa.html</TT>) and <B><A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut14_ex/proj.html">Research Project</A></B> (file <TT>proj.html</TT>) both use <TT>&lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;</TT> tags for the main title and <TT>&lt;h3&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;</TT> tags for sub section headings. Go into your text editor and change every occurrent of tags:
<pre>  &lt;h3&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/h3&gt;</pre>
with:
<pre>  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;B&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</pre>
Note that the &lt;p&gt; tag forces a one line break with preceding text above and the &lt;br&gt; tag forces a line break (no white space) to subsequent text.
<p>
Can you see the difference between using the <TT>&lt;font&gt;</TT> tags and the <TT>&lt;hN&gt;</TT> tags for section titles?  The formatting differences may be subtle, but it does offer you, the HTML author, alternatives for your web page design. Just remember that if a reader's browser does not support font size tags, they will see <B>all</B> the text as the standard size.<p>

<H2>Font Color</H2>
In <A HREF="tut16.html">lesson 16</A>, we introduced the tags for coloring text of the entire web page as well as the proper format for representing color values in HTML. You can also add an attribute to the <font> tag to color a selected portion of text:<p>

<center>
<font size=+1 color=#FF0000>
<TT>&lt;font color=#FF0000&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Red </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#FF8800>
<TT>&lt;font color=#FF8800&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Orange </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#FFFF00>
<TT>&lt;font color=#FFFF00&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Yellow </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#00FF00>
<TT>&lt;font color=#00FF00&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Green </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#0000FF>
<TT>&lt;font color=#0000FF&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Blue </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#0088FF>
<TT>&lt;font color=#0088FF&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Indigo </B></font><br>
<font size=+1  color=#FF00FF>
<TT>&lt;font color=#FF00FF&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> = <B>Violet </B></font>
</center>
<p>
We will not go crazy with the color tags, but as an example, we will change the color of the VOLCANO WEB text we worked on above for the cover page. If you recall, we set the text color for the text of this page to yellow and we will override that color just for the title text:
<ol>
<li>Open the <TT>index.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Edit the line that contains the text of VOLCANO WEB to read:
<pre>  &lt;B&gt;&lt;font size=+4 color=#FF66FF&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;font size=+3 color=#DD0055&gt;OLCANO WEB&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser
</ol>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: The <TT>size</TT> and <TT>color</TT> attributes can reside together in a <TT>&lt;font&gt;</TT> tag. The effect here makes the "V" a brighter violet color and one size larger than the other letters.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3>Superscripts and Subscripts</h3>
Until HTML 3.0 you were out of luck if you needed to write mathematical expressions, chemical formulas, or other expressions with superscripts and/or subscripts. These new tags raise/lower the "scripted" text one half line and sizes it one unit smaller.
<p>
The HTML format for these tags is:<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td>super<sup>script</sup></td>
<td> </td>
<td><TT>&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;</TT></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sub<sub>script</sub></td>
<td> </td>
<td><TT>&lt;sub&gt;...&lt;/sub&gt;</TT></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
We will now use these tags for our <B>Introduction</B> page:
<ol>
<li>Open the <TT>intro.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>First we will use subscripts to write some chemical formulas.
After the last sentence in paragraph 2 ("Compare the history of human beings...'), add this sentence that uses subscripts:
<pre>  Volcanoes were important contributors to 
  the early earth atmosphere by releasing 
  gases such as nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 
  carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and 
  ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).</pre>
<li>Now we will use superscripts to denote a cubic volume. Below the
table we created with the <TT>&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;</TT> tags, add this sentence:
<pre>  Note that volcanic eruptions that occurred 
  before historic times were several orders 
  of magnitude larger (more than 1000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 
  in erupted volume) than ones observed by 
  humans.</pre>
<li>If you notice the third column of our table, when we first
wrote it we had to use <TT>"km^3"</TT> to indicate <TT>"km<sup>3</sup>"</TT>. 
Although this text is <b>inside</b> the preformat tag, we can still use the superscript tag. To do this change:
<pre>  Volume in km^3</pre>
to
<pre>  Volume in km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;</pre>
</ol>

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut18_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. 


<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How do you change the size and color of a portion of text in a web page?
<li>What HTML can you use if your browser does not support the <TT>&lt;font&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> tags?
<li>What does the <TT>&lt;basefont&gt;</TT> tag do?
<li>How do you create subscripts in HTML?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Try experimenting with the <TT>&lt;font&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> tags
in your own web pages. See how they can work inside of the <TT>&lt;hN&gt;...&lt;/hN&gt;</TT> tags too. Look for places where you think you might need superscripts or subscripts. One example might be for footnotes- you could number or character code them, and then each footnote could act as a hypertext link to a footnote (or jump to a separate page for end notes):

<h1>4. Breaking it up into paragraphs</h1>
So far you have created and modified HTML documents, and you should
feel comfortable with the process of editing text and reloading it
into your web browser. So now relax for this <strong>fast </strong>lesson on
inserting paragraph breaks.
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the paragraph break tag in HTML.
<li>Copy text from the web page and paste it in another document.
<li>Insert paragraph breaks into the text of your HTML document and
view the changes within your web browser.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
<h3>HTML Paragraph Breaks</h3>
We've seen earlier that a web browser will ignore all of the CARRIAGE
RETURNS typed into your text editor. But, wherever a browser sees the
<tt>paragraph</tt> tag, it inserts a blank line and starts a new
paragraph. The HTML code for forcing a paragraph break is:
<pre>
     &lt;p&gt;
</pre>
Note that this tag is special in that it does not require an ending tag;
you do not need to use:
<pre>
     &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

In a later lesson we will see an instance where the <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag does use a closing <TT>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> but for the majority of your HTML work, it is not necessary.
<p>
Also note the <TT>&lt;h&gt;</TT> tags have a built in break so it is unnessary to put <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag before a header tag:
<pre>
     &lt;p&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Blah Blah Blah Blah&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Inserting Paragraph Breaks</h3>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut4get.html">download a copy</a> now. </b><p>
Follow the directions below to insert and view a paragraph break in
your HTML document.<p>
<ol>
<li>Re-open your workspace (if not already opened).
<li>Go to the text editor window.
<li>Open your working document, <code>Volc.html</code>, in the text
editor (if not already opened).
<li>First we want to move the sentences <tt>("A volcano is
.....")</tt> so that they are under the <b>Introduction</b> heading.
Use the mouse to <B>cut</B> and <B>paste</B> this text in the proper location.
<li>After these sentences, we want to add some more text. But rather than
re-typing this in, from this web page use your mouse to select and
<b>copy</b> the sentences:
<pre>
     Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history
     long before humans. Compare the history of human 
     beings, a few million years in the making, to that of 
     the Earth, over four billion years in the making. 

</pre>
<li>Now, return to your HTML document in the text editor, and
<b>paste</b> this text after the existing sentences under the
<tt>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</tt> heading.
<li>Save the changes in the text editor.
<li>Return to your web browser.
<li>If your working document is not visible, Use the <b>Open
Local...</b> command from the <b>File</b> menu to open the document.
<li>Select <b>Reload</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. You should now
see the two sentences of the Introduction. We now want to put a
paragraph break <i>between</i> these sentences.
<li>Again, return to your HTML document in the text editor.
<li>After the second sentence under <tt>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</tt> (the one that ends " as a sticky, slow lava flow."), press RETURN (it is not necessary but it makes the HTML more readable as you work on it), and then enter the <tt>paragraph</tt>
tag: 
<pre>     &lt;p&gt;

</pre>

This section should now look like:
<pre>  &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
  A volcano is a location where magma, 
  or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. 
  It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, 
  or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.
  &lt;p&gt;
  Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long before
  humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million
  years in the making, to that of the Earth, over four
  billion years in the making.
</pre>
<li>Save the changes in the text editor.
<li>Return to your web browser and <b>Reload</b> the document. The two
sentences of the introduction should now be separate paragraphs.
</ol>
<hr>

<h3>Other types of breaks</h3>
To separate major sections of a web page, use  the <tt>hard
rule</tt> or <tt>hr</tt> tag. This inserts a straight line like you
see right above the heading for this section.<p>

The HTML format for a <tt>hard rule</tt> tag is:
<pre>
     &lt;hr&gt;
</pre>
Let's try it now! Put an <tt>hr</tt> tag above the
<b>Introduction</b> heading. This will help to separate the
opening sentence of the lesson from the other portions that will
follow.

<p>
And finally, there is the <TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tag which forces text to  a
new line like the &lt;p&gt; tag, but without inserting a blank line. You might use this tag
when making a list of items, when writing the lines of a poem, etc. Compare the differences between 
using the &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; in these two examples:
<p>
<table border=2 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr align=center>
<td><H2>HTML</H2></td><td><H2>Result</H2></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<PRE>And then, we could all see
at once the brilliant purpose 
of the paragraph tag.
&lt;p&gt;
Moving on...
&lt;p&gt;
the more tags you write, the better you 
will feel?</PRE>
</td>
<td valign=top>
And then, we could all see at once the brilliant purpose of the
paragraph tag.
<p>
Moving on...
<p>
the more tags you write, the better you will feel?
</td>
</tr>
<tr align=center>
<td colspan=2> <B>COMPARED TO</B> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<PRE>And then, we could all see&lt;br&gt; 
at once the brilliant purpose&lt;br&gt;
of the paragraph tag.
&lt;p&gt;
Moving on...
&lt;br&gt;
the more tags you write, the better you 
will feel?</PRE>
</td>
<td valign=top>
And then, we could all see<br> 
at once the brilliant purpose<br>
of the paragraph tag.
<p>
Moving on...
<br>
the more tags you write, the better you will feel?
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
If you would like, compare your web page to this <a
href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut4_ex.html">sample</a>.  If your  document was
different from the sample, review how you entered the paragraph
break, &lt;p&gt;, into the text editor. Make sure you entered it as
instructed in the <b>Inserting Paragraph Breaks </b> section of this
lesson.

<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What is the HTML tag for a paragraph break?
<li>What steps did you use for inserting a paragraph break in your
document?
<li>How did you display and view the changes in your web browser?
<li>Extra Credit*- What is a hard rule &lt;hr&gt; tag? a &lt;br&gt; tag?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Use the <tt>paragraph</tt>, the <tt>hard rule</tt>, or the <TT>br</TT> tags to create
paragraphs or sections in your own  document.

<h1>19. Easy Hard Rules</h1>
Confused? This is just one more option for creating fancy
<hr size=8 width=20%>
dividers to mark the different sections of a web page.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create hard rule lines with different thicknesses.
<li>Create hard rule lines with different widths.
<li>Create hard rule lines without 3D shading
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: We will not be modifying our web pages in this lesson- so you can just review the information and then decide if you want to experiment with it. You may want to first look at the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut19_ex/test.html">test</A> page to see of your browser supports the tags used in this lesson</b>
<p>
NetScape's first HTML extensions offered some more formatting options for the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag (<b>H</b>ard <b>R</b>ule) - see <A HREF="tut4.html">lesson 4</A>). The NetScape browser by default displayed the solid line separator with a three-dimensional, shaded look rather then the solid line as implemented in previous web browsers.
<H3>Line Thickness</H3>
The first option is to allow for lines of different thicknesses by using the option:
<pre>  &lt;hr size=N&gt;
</pre>
where <tt>N</tt> is the thickness of the line in pixels. Let's look at some examples to show the effect (which does not show up very distinctly against the white background of this page).<p>
<center>
<font size=+2>
<TT>&lt;hr size=2&gt; same as &lt;hr&gt;</TT> :
<hr>
<p>
<TT>&lt;hr size=8&gt;</TT> :
<hr size=8>
<p>
<TT>&lt;hr size=20&gt;</TT> :
<hr size=20>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<H3>Line Width</H3>
The other formatting option for the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag is to adjust the width of the line- it does not necessarily have to stretch across the whole page. You can do this by using this format:
<pre>  &lt;hr width=X&gt;
  &lt;hr width=Z%&gt;</pre>

where X is a number of pixels for the width and Z is the percentage of the current web page. In general we recommend using the percentage as it will adjust itself the width of the browser window used by the person reading your pages (some out there are using 2-page high resolution monitors while others are squinting into their 13" screen).
<p>
Here are some examples (see how we include the size tag as well):

<center>
<font size=+2>
<TT>&lt;hr width=80 size=10&gt;</TT> :
<hr width=80 size=10>
<p>
<TT>&lt;hr width=80% size=10&gt;</TT> :
<hr width=80% size=10>

<H3>No Shading</H3>
Finally, there may be a case where you do not want the 3D shading on the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag. It is as simple as:
<center>
<font size=+2>
<TT>&lt;hr width=80% size=6 noshade&gt;</TT> :</font>
<hr width=80% size=6 noshade>
<p>
</center>
<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How do you change the thickness of a hard rule?
<li>How can you change the width of a hard rule?
<li>What is the effect of the <TT>noshade</TT> attribute do inside the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag?
</ol>

<h1>20. Extra Alignment</h1>
<font size=+1>Why just stay over to the <b>left</b>?
<div align=right>... when you can move to the <B>right</B>?</div><p>
<div align=center>or just hang out in the middle?</div>
</font>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create text that is aligned to center of the page.
<li>Align images and blocks of text.
<li>Create text that is right justified.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20get.html">download a copy</a> now. Also, you may want to first look at the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/test.html">test</A> page to see of your browser supports the tags used in this lesson</b>

<H3>Text Alignment</H3>
As the web grew and grew and grew, there was demand for more control over page layout. One desire was to format text was aligned to the center of a page, rather then just justified to the left margin. 
<p>
This gets into one of those sticky NetScape versus "standard" HTML situations.
NetScape introduced an HTML extensions- <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tag- it aligns everything inside the tags with the center of the web page. Seems to make sense? Well, if you talk to a mark-up language purist, alignment is an <b>attribute</b>. The more general (and therefore more widely supported) HTML for center alignment is a variation on the <TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT> tag:
<pre>  &lt;p&gt;
  blah blah blah
  &lt;img src=&quot;file.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  blah blah
  &lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  
Note that now there is a closing <TT>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> tag. Also, if you are center aligning several paragraphs, each one will have to be marked with a separate <TT>&lt;p align=center&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</TT>
<p>
Some other browsers now support NetScape's <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tags, but not all of them. Remember that if a browser does not support a tag, it will just ignore it.

<p>
For the effect of center alignment, compare:<p>

<center>
<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=8 width=80%>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Cheese In History</h3>
<b>Cheese was been there for many major events</b>
<p>
When Magellan sailed through the narrow Straits, he was eating cheese. When the Allied troops landed in Europe, cheese was there. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, he had just had finished a cheese snack.
<p>
<img src="left.gif"><br>
<tt>return to the cheese home page</tt>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center>

<p>

<p>
<img src="left.gif"><br>
<tt>return to the cheese home page</tt>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Now we will modify our cover page (<TT>index.html</TT>) to use the center tag on the list of lesson sections. We will also make some other changes to improve it's appearance.
<ol>
<li>Open up the <TT>index.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Find the section that looks like:
<pre>  &lt;B&gt;In this Lesson...&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;intro.html&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;term.html&quot;&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;usa.html&quot;&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;mars.html&quot;&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;proj.html&quot;&gt;Research Project&lt;/A&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
  
and replace it with the following HTML:

  <pre>  &lt;p align=center&gt;
  &lt;font size=+1&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;A HREF=&quot;intro.html&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;A HREF=&quot;term.html&quot;&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;A HREF=&quot;usa.html&quot;&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;A HREF=&quot;mars.html&quot;&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;A HREF=&quot;proj.html&quot;&gt;Research Project&lt;/A&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Load</B> into your web browser.
</ol>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Look closely at the changes we have made. This whole section is enclosed in the <TT>&lt;p align=center&gt;..&lt;/p&gt; </TT>tags for alignment. The unordered list we built in <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A> would look odd centered- the bullet marks would be staggered. So we have removed the <TT>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</TT> structure. The <TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT> tags at the end of each line will force a line break. And finally, we have added a <TT>&lt;font&gt;...&lt;/font&gt;</TT> tag to increase the text size.
<p>
if you wish you could also use the <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tags in place of <TT>&lt;p align=center&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</TT></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
You may want to compare your HTML file to an <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/test1.txt">example</A> of how it should look at this point.
<p>
Any header <TT>&lt;hN&gt;...&lt;/hN&gt;</TT> tag may be center aligned by adding the attribute:
<pre>  &lt;hN align=center&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/hN&gt;</pre>
We will know use this to center the title of each web page:
<ol>
<li>Open all of your other HTML files in your text editor.
<li>For each one, edit the text that appears near the top, in <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;h2&gt;</tt> tags, following this example from file <tt>intro.html</tt> :
<pre>  &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
to
<pre>  &lt;h2 align=center&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> and <B>Load</B> into your web browser.
</ol>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: There is also an align attribute for the <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag that is relevant to the other options we reviewed in <A HREF="tut19.html">lesson 19</A> "Easy Hard Rules". When you specify a shorter width for a hard rule, you can also specify that it be aligned to the left or the right (the default is to center align hard rule lines):</B>
<pre>  &lt;hr size=8 width=60% align=right&gt;</pre> <B>will produce:</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<hr size=8 width=60% align=right>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>while using left alignment</B>
<pre>  &lt;hr size=8 width=60% align=left&gt;</pre> <B>produces:</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<hr size=8 width=60% align=left>

<H2>Aligning Images and Text</H2>
In <A HREF="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</A> we learned how to put images in our pages and saw that we could have one line of text align with the top, middle, or top of an image. However, up to now, we could not have a block of text sitting side by side with an inline image. 
<p>
With the <TT>align</TT> attribute to the <TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag be can now specify to have the image itself aligned to the right or left margin of the page. But more so, we can have any HTML following it "fill" in around the empty space. The HTML to do this is:
<pre>  &lt;img src=&quot;filename.gif&quot; align=right&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;filename.gif&quot; align=left&gt;</pre>
  
Compare these two examples:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=8 width=80%>
<tr>
<th>no align attribute or <TT>align=bottom</TT></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h3>Cheese In History</h3>
<b>Cheese was been there for many major events</b>
<br>
When Magellan sailed through the narrow Straits, he was eating cheese. When the Allied troops landed in Europe, cheese was there. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, he had just had finished a cheese snack.
<p>
<img src="left.gif"><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th><TT>align=left</TT></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="left.gif" align=left>
<h3>Cheese In History</h3>
<b>Cheese was been there for many major events</b><br>

When Magellan sailed through the narrow Straits, he was eating cheese. When the Allied troops landed in Europe, cheese was there. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, he had just had finished a cheese snack.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Shrink and stretch your web browser window to see how it affects your page with aligned images/text.
<p>
One more note. There will be times when the text or other items that are aligned with the image are rather short and you want to force the next text to jump down below the image. There is an attribute for the <br> tag to clear the alignment:
<pre>  &lt;br clear=left&gt;
  &lt;br clear=right&gt;
  &lt;br clear=all&gt;</pre>
that will "clear" any preceding alignments set up in the <TT>&lt;img&gt; </TT> tags. We suggest that you always use these tags because the alignment will vary depending on the font specified in the reader's web browser and the width of their browser window.
<p>
We will now return to our <TT>index.html</TT> page to re-format the opening screen. The picture may look nice, but it takes more vertical space to have the picture followed by the text below. We will use the image/text alignment to put some of the text adjacent to the image.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <TT>volc.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Find the portion that reads:
<pre>  &lt;img alt=&quot;A Lesson on:&quot;   src=&quot;../pictures/lava.gif&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;font size=+4 color=#FF66FF&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;font size=+3 color=#DD0055&gt;OLCANO WEB&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&quot;Nature raves savagely, 
  threatening the lands&quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  -- <A HREF="http://magic.geol.ucsb.edu/~fisher/pliny.htm">Pliny the Elder</A>, who died of asphyxiation after 
  observing the destruction of Pompeii by the
  79 A.D. eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
  &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

  In this lesson you will use the Internet
  to research information on volcanoes and then 
  write a report on your
  results.</pre>
and replace it with:
<pre>  &lt;img alt=&quot;A Lesson on:&quot; src=&quot;../pictures/lava.gif&quot;   align=left&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;
  &quot;Nature raves savagely, threatening the lands&quot;
  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  -- <A HREF="http://magic.geol.ucsb.edu/~fisher/pliny.htm">Pliny the Elder</A>, who died of asphyxiation after

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;font size=+4 color=#FF66FF&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;font size=+3 color=#DD0055&gt;OLCANO WEB&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  In this lesson you will use the Internet
  to research information on volcanoes and then write a report on your
  results.
  &lt;br clear=left&gt;</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Everything between  the <TT>&lt;img... align=left&gt;</TT> tag  and 
the <TT>&lt;br clear=left&gt;</TT> tag will be
placed adjacent to the picture- the image is aligned left and the other HTML
fills the empty space.<p>
We also put the quotation at the top to attract attention. With this
new layout, the <TT>&lt;blockquote&gt;</TT> tag is not effective, so it was removed.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
You may want to compare your HTML file to an <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/test2.txt">example</A> of how it should look at this point. 

<H2>Text Justification/Alignment</H2>
We will add in one more alignment tag, the "divisions" tag <TT>&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</TT>, introduced as part of HTML 3.0. All text within the tag is justified according to the align attribute:
<pre>  &lt;div align=left&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div align=right&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div align=center&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
Note that the center attribute accomplishes the same effect as the NetScape <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tag.
<p>
We will now use this tag to make the opening quotation on our cover page have its text aligned to the <b>right</b> margin of the page:
<ol>
<li>Open your <TT>index.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Add the <TT>&lt;div&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/div&gt;</TT> tags as shown below:
<pre>  &lt;div align=right&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;
  &quot;Nature raves savagely, threatening the lands&quot;
  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  -- <A HREF="http://magic.geol.ucsb.edu/~fisher/pliny.htm">Pliny the Elder</A>, who died of asphyxiation after 
  observing the destruction of Pompeii by the
  79 A.D. eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;B&gt;&lt;font size=+4 color=#FF66FF&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;
  &lt;font size=+3 color=#DD0055&gt;OLCANO WEB&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> and then <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut20_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. 


<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How do you make certain parts of your web page aligned to the center
of the page?

<h1>6. Lists, Lists, Lists</h1>
Lists can present items of information in an easy-to-read
format.  In fact, there is a list right here, lurking under the next
heading!
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify HTML codes for creating unordered, ordered, and nested
lists for a web page.
<li>Place different list types within your HTML document and view
the changes within your web page.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>

Many web pages display lists of items- these may be items
preceded with a "bullet" (Unordered) or a sequentially numbered list
(Ordered). 
These lists are easy to format in HTML, and they may even be nested
(lists of lists) to produce an outline format. Lists are also handy
for creating an index or table of contents to a series of documents
or chapters.

<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
Unordered Lists, or <tt>ul</tt> tags, are ones that appear as a list
of items with "bullets" or markers in the front. The bullet marks
will depend on the particular version of your web browser and the font
specified for displaying normal WWW text (i.e. for Macintosh, the
bullets are the option-8 character- in Times font this is a small
square, in Geneva it is a large round dot).
<p>
Here is an example of an unordered list:<p>
<B>My Unordered List:</B>
<ul>
<li>Item 1
<li>Item 2
<li>Item 3
</ul>
<p>
And this is the HTML format for producing this format:
<pre>
     &lt;B&gt;My Unordered List:&lt;/B&gt;
     &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;  Item 1
     &lt;li&gt;  Item 2
     &lt;li&gt;  Item 3
     &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
The <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt> tag marks the beginning and end of the list,
and the <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> indicates each <tt>list item</tt>. 
<h4>Ordered Lists</h4>
Ordered lists are ones where the browser numbers each successive <tt>list
item</tt> starting with "1." Note that the only difference is
changing the <tt>ul</tt> tag to <tt>ol</tt> tag. Using the example
from above:<p>

<B>My Ordered List:</B>
<ol>
<li>Item 1
<li>Item 2
<li>Item 3
</ol>
<p>
And this is the HTML format for producing this format:
<pre>
     &lt;B&gt;My Ordered List:&lt;/B&gt;
     &lt;ol&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;   Item 1
     &lt;li&gt;   Item 2
     &lt;li&gt;   Item 3
     &lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Nested Lists</h3>
Ordered Lists and Unordered lists can have different levels, each
will be indented appropriately by your web browser. Your major concern will be
to verify that each list is properly terminated and the nesting order
is correct.
<p>
It can start to look complicated with all of those &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; tags
floating around, but just try to remember the basic structure


<PRE>
      &lt;ul&gt;            &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;           &lt;/ol&gt;
</PRE>
<p>
Here is an example of an unordered list with sub levels of
other lists:<p>
<B>Nested Unordered List</B>
<ul>
<li>This is the first item
<li>This is the second item
<ul>
<li>This is the first sub item of the second item
<ul>
<li>And this is a sub item of a sub item
<li>Getting lost yet?
</ul>
<li>This is the second sub item of the second item
<li>This is the third sub item of the second item
</ul>
<li>This is the third item
</ul>
Note how the bullet marks change for different levels of the list.
<p>
And this is the HTML format for producing this format:
<pre>
     &lt;ul&gt;&lt;B&gt;Nested Unordered List&lt;/B&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;This is the first item
     &lt;li&gt;This is the second item
     &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; This is the first sub item of the second item
     &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; And this is a sub item of a sub item
     &lt;li&gt; Getting lost yet?
     &lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; This is the second sub item of the second item
     &lt;li&gt; This is the third sub item of the second item
     &lt;/ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;This is the third item
     &lt;/ul&gt;

</pre>

<h3>Nested Lists - Mixing them together</h3>
Not only can you include ordered lists within ordered lists, but you can
also mix and match list types.
Hold onto your hats! The HTML starts to look pretty ugly, but watch
how lists completely contain other lists.
<p>
For example, this ordered list includes a nested unordered list:<p>
<B>Nested Unordered List</B>
<ol>
<li>This is the first item
<li>This is the second item
<ul>
<li>This is the first sub item of the second item
<ol>
<li>An this is a numbered sub item of a sub item
<li>An this is another numbered subItem of a sub item
<li>Getting lost yet?
</ol>
<li>This is the second sub item of the second item
<li>This is the third sub item of the second item
</ul>
<li>This is the third item
</ol>

And this is the HTML format for producing this format. Note how the
HTML has been indented to make it easier to read:
<pre>
&lt;B&gt;Nested Unordered List&lt;/B&gt;
     &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is the first item
        &lt;li&gt;This is the second item
           &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt; This is the first sub item of the second item
              &lt;ol&gt;
              &lt;li&gt; An this is a numbered subItem of a sub item
              &lt;li&gt; An this is another numbered sub item of a sub item
              &lt;li&gt; Getting lost yet?
              &lt;/ol&gt;
           &lt;li&gt; This is the second sub item of the second item
           &lt;li&gt; This is the third sub item of the second item
           &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is the third item
     &lt;/ol&gt;

</pre>

<h3>Placing Lists in Your HTML Document</h3>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut6get.html">download a copy</a> now. </b>
<p>
Using the <tt>list</tt> tags, you will now add an Ordered and an
un-Ordered list to your <i>Volcano Web</i> page.<p>

<ol>
<li>Re-open your workspace (if not already opened).
<li>Open your HTML document in the text editor.
<li>Under the <tt>Volcano Terminology</tt> header we will use an
un-ordered list to display examples of technical words used in the
study of volcanoes. Go to this section in your HTML document.
<li>First add the following sentence.  
<pre>
     How many do you know?
</pre>
<li>Now, enter the HTML format to create the list of terms:
<pre>
      &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;caldera
          &lt;li&gt;vesicularity
          &lt;li&gt;pahoehoe
          &lt;li&gt;rheology
          &lt;li&gt;lahar
      &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<li>Now we will use an ordered list to define the required parts of
the assignment in this lesson. Under the <tt>Research
Project</tt> heading, enter the following: (HINT- this might be a
good time to copy and paste from the web page, unless you enjoy
typing in text!)
<pre>
  Your mission is to find information and report on a volcano, 
  other than the ones listed above, that has erupted in the last 
  100 years. Your reports must include:
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Type of volcano
    &lt;li&gt;Geographic location
    &lt;li&gt;Name, distance, and population of nearest major city
    &lt;li&gt;Dates of most recent and most destructive eruptions.
    &lt;li&gt;Other events associated with the recent eruptions  
    (earthquakes, floods, mudslides, etc)
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  Then, write a one page description on the major hazards to humans 
  in the vicinity of this volcano. Speculate on what you would do 
  if you were in charge of minimizing the risk to the population.
</pre>
<li><b>Save</b> your HTML file and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
You may want to compare your  document with a <a
href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut6_ex.html">sample</a> for this section. If your list is
different than the list in the sample, review how you entered your
list in your text editor. Make sure it matches the instructions in
the <b>Placing Lists in Your HTML Document</b> section of this
lesson.
<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>How are lists valuable in a web page?
<li>What is the HTML tag for a unordered list?
<li>What is the tag for a ordered list?
<li>How might you set up a nested list?
<li>What steps did you use in adding a list to your HTML document?
</ol> 
<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
You may want to experiment with changing the Ordered List you create
to Unordered. Also, 
insert an Ordered or an Unordered list of items to your own WWW
document. Be sure to verify that it displays correctly in your web browser.
Can you create a list that includes sublists?

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22get.html">download a copy</a> now. Also, you may want to first look at the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22_ex/test.html">test</A> page to see of your browser supports the tags used in this lesson</b>
<p>
<H2>No Hypertext Borders on Hyperlinked Images</H2>
In <A HREF="tut8e.html">lesson 8e</A> we learned how to make a small graphic image act as a hyperlink to some other web page or a larger size copy of a picture. We noticed that the web browser places a bounding box around the graphic, to identify it as being "hyper" like normal hypertext items:
<p>
<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/likethis.html"><IMG SRC="disk.gif" ALIGN=middle WIDTH=48 HEIGHT=40></A> works just like any other <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/likethis.html">hypertext link.</A>
<p>
However, the box is sometimes distracting, especially if we have an image that has non-rectangular borders. The user can typically determine if a picture is "hyper" simply by noting a change in the cursor as they move a mouse over the image (it usually changes to a "hand" when it is over an active link). 
<p>
You can turn "off" the box by adding an attribute to the <TT>&lt;img...&gt;</TT> tag:
<pre>  &lt;a href=&quot;bigpict.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lilpict.gif&quot; border=0&gt;</a></pre>
In this example, the inline image <TT>lilpict.gif</TT> acts as a hyperlink to the bigger image <TT>bigpict.gif</TT>. The <TT>border=0</TT> attribute has no meaning if the <TT>&lt;img..&gt;</TT> tag is not inside of an <TT>&lt;a href=...&lt;/a&gt;</TT> tag.
<p>
We have two places in our <I>Volcano Web</I> lesson where we have hyperlinked inline images- Do you remember where? 
<p>
The first is in the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/usa.html"><TT>usa.html</TT></A> file, where a small image of a seismometer links to a larger sized image. The second is the arrow button on the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/msh.html"><TT>msh.html</TT></A> page that leads back to the lesson.
<ol>
<li>Open both the <TT>usa.html</TT> and the <TT>msh.html</TT> in your text editor
<li>Locate the place where we have a small image that links to something else.
<li>Modify each <TT>&lt;img src=....&gt;</TT> tag that is a hyperlink so that it contains a <TT>border=0</TT> attribute. For example, in the <TT>msh.html</TT> file it should look like:
<pre>  &lt;a href=&quot;usa.html&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/left.gif&quot; alt=&quot;** &quot; border=0&gt; 
  Return to &lt;i&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Load</B> the  <TT>usa.html</TT> and <TT>msh.html</TT> files in your web browser.
<li>If the small images have lost their  borders but still connect to their intended target when clicked, your job is done.
</ol>

<H2>Bullets for Un-Ordered Lists</H2>
In <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A> we first created ordered <TT>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</TT> lists. The web browser automatically puts a bullet mark in front of each item- and the bullets change if we create a list inside of a list. With some web browsers, you can specify in your HTML any of three bullet characters by adding an attribute to the <TT>&lt;ul&gt;</TT> tag:
<pre> &lt;ul type=xxxx&gt;</pre>
where <tt>xxxx</tt> can be:
<ul>
<li type=circle><TT>type=circle</TT>
<li type=square><TT>type=square</TT>
<li type=disc><TT>type=disc</TT> [default bullet for top level list]
</ul>
And even more! You can change the type <b>within</b> a list by putting the type attribute in the <TT>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag:
<table cellpadding=4>
<tr>
<th>HTML</th>
<th>How it Looks</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<PRE>&lt;ul type=square&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is item 1
&lt;li&gt;this is item 2
&lt;li&gt;this is item 3
&lt;li type=circle&gt;
     Hey! how about these bullets?
&lt;li&gt;this is another item
&lt;li&gt;and one more
&lt;li type=disc&gt;
     Hey! how about these bullets?
&lt;/ul&gt;</PRE>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ul type=square>
<li>this is item 1
<li>this is item 2
<li>this is item 3
<li type=circle>Hey! how about these bullets?
<li>this is another item
<li>and one more
<li type=disc>Hey! how about these bullets?
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that the type specified in the <TT>&lt;li type=xxxx&gt;</TT> tag is used by all succeeding <TT>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tags until another bullet type is selected.
<p>
We will now change the bullet list style used in our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/proj.html">Research Projects</A> page (file <TT>proj.html</TT>).
<ol>
<li>Open your <TT>proj.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>The first list in this file is an Ordered List <TT>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</TT> but we will now change it to an unordered list with <TT>circle</TT> bullets. Edit your HTML for this first list so that it looks like:<pre>
  &lt;ul type=circle&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type of volcano
  &lt;li&gt;Geographic location
  &lt;li&gt;Name, distance, and population of nearest major city
  &lt;li&gt;Date of most recent eruption and date of most destructive
      eruption
  &lt;li&gt;Other events associated with the last eruption (earthquakes,
      floods, mudslides, etc)
  &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Load</B> your file in your web browser. Compare your page with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22_ex/list1.html">sample</A> of how your list should like at this point.
</ol>

<H2>Styles and Values for Ordered Lists</H2>
When we first created an ordered list <TT>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</TT> in <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A>, we saw how the web browser automatically numbers the items, one for each <TT>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag. What is we do not always want to use arabic numerals (1,2,3...)? Well, here is the answers, a <tt>type=x</tt> attribute for the <TT>&lt;ol&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tags inside:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Arabic</th>
<th>Capital Letters</th>
<th>Small Letters</th>
<th>Large Roman</th>
<th>Small Roman</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=1&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=A&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=a&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=I&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=i&gt;</TT></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<ol>
<li>I am first!
<li>I am second!
<li>I am third!
<li>I am fourth!
<li>I am fifth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=A>
<li>I am first!
<li>I am second!
<li>I am third!
<li>I am fourth!
<li>I am fifth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=a>
<li>I am first!
<li>I am second!
<li>I am third!
<li>I am fourth!
<li>I am fifth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=I>
<li>I am first!
<li>I am second!
<li>I am third!
<li>I am fourth!
<li>I am fifth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=i>
<li>I am first!
<li>I am second!
<li>I am third!
<li>I am fourth!
<li>I am fifth!
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
We presented an example of using ordered lists within ordered lists to create outlines- with the <TT>type</TT> attribute we can have pages with standard format:
<ol type=I>
<li>Cheese in Pre-Historic time
	<ol type=A>
	<li>Africa
		<ol type=1>
		<li>Afar Triangle
		<li>East Coast
		</ol>
	<li>Asia
	<li>Europe
		<ol type=1>
		<li>France
			<ol type=a>
			<li>Cave paintings depicting cheese harvesting
			<li>Burial rituals inferred from dried cheese remnants
			</ol>
		<li>British Isles
		</ol>
	<li>North America
	</ol>
<li>Cheese in the Middle Ages
	<ol type=A>
	<li>King Arthur's Longhorn
	<li>Sharp Cheddar for the Crusades
	</ol>
<li>Cheese in the Space Age
</ol>
Another thing we can do with ordered lists is to have them start counting from some other value than 1. to do this, we add the <TT>start=y</TT> attribute to the <TT>&lt;ol&gt;</TT> tag. Note that even if we have some other <TT>type=x</TT> attribute, we still specify the starting value y as "2,3,10,100, etc". Look at some of these examples:
 <table>
<tr>
<th>Arabic</th>
<th>Capital Letters</th>
<th>Small Letters</th>
<th>Large Roman</th>
<th>Small Roman</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=1<br> start=11&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=A<br> start=11&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=a<br> start=11&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=I<br> start=11&gt;</TT></th>
<th><TT>&lt;ol type=i<br> start=11&gt;</TT></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<ol start=11>
<li>I am eleventh!
<li>I am twelfth!
<li>I am thirteenth!
<li>I am fourteenth!
<li>I am fifteenth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=A start=11>
<li>I am eleventh!
<li>I am twelfth!
<li>I am thirteenth!
<li>I am fourteenth!
<li>I am fifteenth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=a start=11>
<li>I am eleventh!
<li>I am twelfth!
<li>I am thirteenth!
<li>I am fourteenth!
<li>I am fifteenth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=I start=11>
<li>I am eleventh!
<li>I am twelfth!
<li>I am thirteenth!
<li>I am fourteenth!
<li>I am fifteenth!
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=i start=11>
<li>I am eleventh!
<li>I am twelfth!
<li>I am thirteenth!
<li>I am fourteenth!
<li>I am fifteenth!
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
And finally you can change the numbering sequence <b>within</b> a list by adding a <TT>value=z</TT> attribute to the <TT>&lt;li&gt;</TT> tag. Look at this example:
<table>
<tr>
<th>HTML</th>
<th>How it Looks</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<PRE>&lt;ol type=A start=5&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Important Cheese Laws&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;li value=12&gt;Cheese Import Tariff of 1942
&lt;li&gt;Cheese Freshness Codes of 1942
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;li value=1&gt;Cheese Values Act of 1789</PRE>
</ol>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<ol type=A start=5><i>Important Cheese Laws</i>

<p>
It may not be exactly clear (especially from this silly example!) when you might use these tags- just keep them in your mind as potential tools in your web writing.
We will demonstrate again on our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut21_ex/proj.html">Research Projects</A> page (file <TT>proj.html</TT>). If you recall, in our <A HREF="tut21.html">lessons on tables</A> we split the unordered list of reference sites into a two columns list. Let's change this to an ordered list and use the <tt>type</tt> attribute to list them using small letters. Because we have actually <b>two</b> individual lists, 
see if you can determine why we would use the <tt>start</tt> attribute as well.
<ol>
<li>Open your <TT>proj.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<li>Look at the table we created under the <b>References</b> section. Change both <TT>&lt;ul&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/ul&gt;</TT> tags to <TT>&lt;ol type=a&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/ol&gt;</TT>
<li>Now, we have 5 items in the first list so we want the second list to start numbering at 6. Modify the <TT>&lt;ol&gt;</TT> tag now to read:
<pre>  &lt;ol type=a start=6&gt;</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> your file in your web browser. Compare your page with this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22_ex/list2.html">sample</A> of how your list should like at this point. The first column should list items from "a" to "e" and the second column from "f" to "k"
</ol>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. 

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How do you get rid of the hypertext box that surrounds a graphic that is hyperlinked to another item?
<li>How can you change the bullet markers for an unordered list?
<li>Do you have to use the same bullet markers for an entire list? If not, how
do you change the markers mid-list?
<li>How can you create a list that marks items by Roman Numerals?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Experiment with different bullet markers and numbering styles in the lists of your own web pages. Can you think of some unique ways to use these added features? Can you make a complex outline with "standard" formatting? All of those <PRE>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</PRE> tags gets to be pretty complicated!

<h1>11. Descriptive Lists</h1>
Yet another more variety of lists, lists, lists....

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>build a list of items with 
    indented text block descriptions.
<li>create a bibliography with a descriptive list
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut11get.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>
<p>
In <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A> we saw how to create two types of lists: 
ordered &lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt; and unordered &lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;. 
We now introduce a third variety, the <B>descriptive
list.</B> Unlike the lists we have seen earlier, the descriptive list marks its entries
not with a bullet marker or a number, but by its pattern of indentation.
<P>
The format for a descriptive list tag is:
<PRE>
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; description title1
&lt;dd&gt; description description1
&lt;dt&gt; description title2
&lt;dd&gt; description description2
                :
                :
                :
&lt;dt&gt; description titleN
&lt;dd&gt; description descriptionN
&lt;/dl&gt;    
</PRE>
The <TT>&lt;dl&gt; .... &lt;/dl&gt</TT>; tags include alternating pairs of
description titles <B>&lt;dt&gt;</B> and descriptions <B>&lt;dd&gt;</B> 
A Web browser will typically generate the list with each description indented to offset it 
from the title.
<p>
As viewed in a web browser, the above example looks like this:
<hr>
<dl>
<dt>description title1
<dd>description description1
<dt>description title2
<dd>description description2
<dt>    : 
<dt>    :
<dt>description titleN
<dd>description descriptionN
</dl>
<hr>
<p>
The descriptive list might be used as a glossary of definitions, but for our example
we will use it to create a short bibliography for our <I>Volcano Web</I> lesson:
<ol>
<li>Open the HTML file, <tt>index.html</tt> in your text editor.
<li>After the unordered list under the heading <B>References</B> 
enter the following:

<PRE>
&lt;h3&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h3&gt;
Check your library for these books:
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Cas, R.A.F. and Wright, J. V. (1987). 
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;I&gt;Volcanic Successions: Modern and Ancient.&lt;/I&gt; 
London: Allen &amp;amp; Unwin.

&lt;dt&gt;La Croix, A. (1904)
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;I&gt;La Montagna Pel&amp;eacute;e et ses &amp;Eacute;ruptions.&lt;/I&gt;
Paris: Masson

&lt;dt&gt;Lipman, P.W. and Mullineaux (eds). (1981)
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;I&gt;The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington.&lt;/I&gt;
U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1250.
&lt;/dl&gt;
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We have used some of the Special Characters for the
ampersand symbol ("&amp;") in the first reference and for the accent marks in
the second reference. If you are unfamiliar with the HTML special characters,
see <A HREF="tut10.html">lesson 10</A> </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> into your web browser.
</ol>

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your  document with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut11_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
document was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor. Do not forget the &lt;dl&gt;... &lt;/dl&gt; tags that mark
the whole list. One common mistake is switching the &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt; tags.
<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How does the descriptive list differ from the ordered and unordered lists?
<li>In what instances might you use a descriptive list?
<li>What is the difference between the <TT>&lt;dt&gt;</TT> 
and the <TT>&lt;dd&gt;</TT> tags?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Use a descriptive list to add a glossary or bibliography to your own HTML page.
<H3>More Information</H3>
You can include other ordered/unordered lists within a descriptive list.
For example, lets say we are making a list of the major mineral groups, with
a description of its characteristics, and a sublist of minerals in
each group and how it is used in society. We wish it to
look like (just a few entries are shown):

<dl>
<dt><B>Oxides</B> 
<dd>Combinations of metal ions with Oxygen, comprises the major ores
extracted in mining operations
   <ul>
   <li>Hematite (iron ore)
   <li>Magnetite (iron ore, magnetic mineral)
   <li>Corundum (gemstone, abrasive)
   </ul>
<dt><B>Sulfates</B>
<dd>Metal ions combine with the Sulfate ion (SO4), atomic structure
sometimes can allow bonding of water molecules
    <ul>
    <li>Gypsum (plaster)
    <li>Barite (drilling mud)
    </ul>
</dl>

The HTML to produce this is:
<PRE>
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxides&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Combinations of metal ions with Oxygen, comprises the major ores
extracted in mining operations
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hematite (iron ore)
    &lt;li&gt;Magnetite (iron ore, magnetic mineral)
    &lt;li&gt;Corundum (gemstone, abrasive)
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sulfates&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Metal ions combines with the Sulfate ion (SO4), atomic structure
sometimes can allow bonding of water molecules
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Gypsum (plaster)
    &lt;li&gt;Barite (drilling mud)
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</PRE>

<h1>7a. Inline Graphics</h1>
WWW Mathematics:
<pre>          Text + Pictures = Multimedia
          Multimedia + WWW = Global HyperMedia</pre>
Got it?
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Place an inline image within your HTML document.
<li>Select how the pictures align with surrounding text.
<li>Modify the inline image tag to account for viewers using a non-graphic
browser.
<li>Specify the dimensions of inline image.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lesson</h2>
Let's see how you can include pictures like the "Big M" with HTML...
<h3>HTML Tags for Inline Graphics</h3>
An "inline" image is one that appears within the text of a WWW 
page, such as <img src="m.gif"> this picture of "Big M". <p>
The
HTML format for the inline <tt>image</tt> tag is:
<pre>
     &lt;img src="filename.gif"&gt;
</pre>
where <tt>filename.gif</tt> is the name of a GIF file in the same
directory/folder as your HTML document. By "inline", this means that
a web browser will display the image in between text.
<p>
Note how the text immediately follows the "Big M"
above. What if we want the "Big M" sitting on its very own line?
To force the image to appear on a separate line, 
<p><img src="m.gif"><p>
simply insert a <tt>paragraph</tt> tag before the
<tt>image</tt> tag:
<pre>
     &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="filename.gif"&gt;
</pre>
<H3>Alignment of Text and Inline Graphics</H3>
With an attribute to the &lt;img...&gt; tag, you can also control how text 
adjacent to the image aligns to the picture. The
the <TT>align</TT> attribute added inside the tag can produce the following:<p>
<h3>1. <TT>align=top</TT></h3>
<pre>&lt;img align=top src="filename.gif"&gt;</pre> 
<img align=top src="m.gif">    <B>is for Maricopa Community
Colleges</B>
located in the Valley of the Sun, metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Our
license plates say that we are the Grand Canyon State...
<hr>
<h3>2. <TT>align=middle</TT></h3>
<pre>&lt;img align=middle src="filename.gif"&gt;</pre>
<img align=middle src="m.gif"> <B>is for Maricopa Community
Colleges</B>
located in the Valley of the Sun, metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Our
license plates say that we are the Grand Canyon State...
<hr>
<h3>3. <TT>align=bottom</TT> (default)</h3>
<pre>&lt;img align=bottom src="filename.gif"&gt;</pre>
<img align=bottom src="m.gif"> <B>is for Maricopa Community
Colleges</B>
located in the Valley of the Sun, metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona.
Our license plates say that we are the Grand Canyon State...
<p>
<hr>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note how the text aligns only for one line... (shrink or stretch
the width of your WWW
browser window to see what happens.) With HTML 2.0, you cannot 
have blocks of text adjacent to a picture.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>Placing an Inline Image in Your HTML document</h3>

<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut7aget.html">download a copy</a> now.</b><p>
In this exercise, you will add an introductory picture of a volcano
to your lesson.
<ol>
<li>Re-open your workspace (if not already open).
<li>Open your <tt>volc.html</tt> document with the text editor.
<li>Above the <tt>&lt;h1&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/h1&gt;</tt>  heading, enter the
following:
<pre>  &lt;img src="lava.gif"&gt;
</pre>

This HTML format will insert, at the very top of your page, the lava picture
that
you downloaded in the <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut7.html">previous lesson</a>.
<li>Save and reload in your web browser.
</ol>


In placing the image, you may have wondered why we did not need to
put a &lt;p&gt; tag after the image. This is because the
following text was a header. A web browser <b>always</b> inserts a paragraph
break
before and after an &lt;h1,h2,h3...&gt; tag.

<h3>The <TT>alt="..."</TT> attribute</h3>
If your web pages will be accessed by users using a text-only browser
(i.e. such as lynx), they will not be able to view any inline images. Or
sometimes, users will turn off the loading of inline images to save time
on downloading over slow network connections. An attribute for the <TT>&lt;img
...&gt;</TT>
tag allows for substitution of a descriptive string of text to hod the place of
the image.

<p>Under these conditions, a viewer will see a place holder so that the 
top of our lesson page looks like:

<pre>
[IMAGE]
                         Volcano Web
In this lesson you will use the Internet to research information 
on volcanoes and then write a report on your results. 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
In this Lesson... 

</pre>
This lets the viewer know that there is a graphic inserted at the 
top of this page. You could modify the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> tag so that rather
then using the place holder, it displays a text string. For example in
our lesson we could add "A Lesson on:" by modifying the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt>
to read:
<pre>     &lt;img alt="A Lesson on:" src="lava.gif"&gt;</pre>
The <tt>alt="..."</tt> attribute replaces the place holder with a text string so
that
from a text-only browser (or when loading of images is shut off), 
it would now appear:
<pre>
A Lesson On
                         Volcano Web
In this lesson you will use the Internet to research information 
on volcanoes and then write a report on your results. 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
In this Lesson... 

</pre>
<p>
At this time, make the same change to your HTML page for the
<tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt>
tag that displays the picture of the volcano.

<H2>Height and Width attributes</H2>
Another option you may want to include in your <TT>&lt;img...&gt;</TT> tags are
two attributes that give the dimensions of the image in pixels. Why? Normally,
your web browser has to determine these dimensions as it reads in the image; the
loading of your page can be faster if you specify these numbers in your HTML.
<p>
The format for including this option is:
<pre>  &lt;img src=&quot;filename.gif&quot; width=X height=Y &gt;</pre>
where <TT>X</TT> is the  width of the image and <TT>Y</TT> is the height of the
image in pixels.
<p>
You can usually use some sort of graphics program or utility to determine these
numbers. For our example in this lesson, the <tt>lava.gif</tt> image is 300
pixels wide and 259 pixels high. So you should now edit your <TT>volc.html</TT>
file to now read:
<pre>  &lt;img alt=&quot;A Lesson on:&quot; src=&quot;lava.gif&quot; width=300
height=259&gt;</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: the order of the attributes inside the <TT>&lt;img&gt;
</TT>tag does not matter.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
You may want to compare your work to this <a
href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut7a_ex.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your document is different from
the example, check how you entered the image format in your text
editor. Make sure you entered it as instructed in the <b>Placing an
Inline Image in Your HTML Document</b> section of this lesson.
<p>
If you see an icon instead of the lava picture, first check that the
HTML file and the GIF image are in the same folder/directory. Then,
you may want to make sure that the file name entered in the <TT>&lt;img... 
&gt;</TT> 
tag matches the name of the GIF file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Some computer systems (UNIX) are case sensitive for the
names of files, meaning
that the file <TT>"lava.GIF"</TT> is NOT the same as <TT>"lava.gif"</TT>. Other
computers (Macintosh) consider them as the same files. Even if your computer
does
not differentiate, we suggest that you be consistent in the naming of files and
how they are referred to in your HTML. (Many WWW servers run
UNIX).</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What is the HTML format for an inline image?
<li>What type of tag must you put before an image tag to make the
image appear on a separate line?
<li>How did you add the lava picture to your document?
<li>What does the <TT>alt="...."</TT> attribute do?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Add an inline image to your web page using a GIF picture file
that is stored on your computer or one that you have downloaded from
the Internet.
<hr>

<h2>Coming Next....</h2>
Create links to other documents and files that you create as well as
ones on the Internet.

<h1>8a. Linking to Local Files</h1>
Now, you will take your first step of "anchoring" by creating a hypertext link
to a second web page. These links are called "local" because they
reside on the same computer as the working document (they do not have to venture out on the Internet). You will also be shuffling around the parts of your growing web.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create a link to an HTML document in the same directory/folder as your main document.
<li>Create a link to display a graphic image.
<li>Create a link to file in a different directory/folder than your main document.
<li>Reorganize the structure of your web.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8aget.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>

<h3>Link to Local Files</h3>
The simplest <tt>anchor</tt> link is one that opens another HTML file
in the same directory as the presently displayed web page. The
HTML format for doing this is:
<pre>
     &lt;a href="filename.html"&gt;text that responds to link&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
The filename must be another HTML file. Whatever text occurs after
the first &gt; and before the closing &lt;/a&gt; symbols will be the
"hypertext" that appears underlined and "hyper."
<p>
Now follow these steps to build an anchor link in your HTML document to a
local file:
<ol>
<li>Open your HTML document in the text editor.
<li>First, under the <tt>Volcanic Places in the USA</tt> heading,
enter the following text which introduces the two volcanoes discussed
in later sections.
<pre>
     Listed below are two places in the United States that are 
     considered "active" volcanic areas.</pre>
     
<li>Below the <tt>Mount St. Helens</tt> heading, enter:
<pre>
     On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, this quiet
     mountain in Washington provided &lt;a href="msh.html"&gt;
     detailed observations&lt;/a&gt; on the mechanics
     of highly explosive eruptions.</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>The text "detailed observations" will link the viewer
to a second HTML document called <tt>msh.html</tt>. This second HTML file does not yet
exist; we will construct it in steps (5) and (6).</b></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li>Save and close your HTML document
<li>Now, with your text editor, open a window for a <b>New</b>
document.
<li>Enter the following text in the new window:
<pre>
     &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/h1&gt;
     The towering pine trees of this once-quiet mountain 
     were toppled over like toys.
     &lt;/body&gt;
     &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<li>Save this file as <tt>msh.html</tt> in the same
directory/folder as your working HTML file (<tt>Volc.html</tt>).
<li><b>Reload</b> <tt>Volc.html</tt> in your web browser.
<li>Test the hypertext link for the words "detailed observations". When selected, it 
should connect you to the new page about Mount St. Helens.
 </ol>
 
<h3>Anchor Link to a Graphic</h3>
In a <a href="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</a>, we learned how to display an
"inline" graphic that would appear in your web page. With the
<tt>anchor</tt> tag, you can also create a link to display a graphic file. 
When the anchor link is
selected, it will download the image file and your web browser may launch an
external application that can display it in an external window or display the image by itself in an empty page.

<p>
The simplest anchor link is to a file in the same directory/folder
as the document that calls it. The format for creating a hypertext
link to a graphic is the same as above for linking to another HTML
document:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="filename.gif"&gt;text that responds to link&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
where <tt>filename.gif</tt> is the name of a GIF image file.
<p>
Now follow these steps to add a link to a graphic file in your HTML
document:
<ol>
<li>First, you will need to download a copy of a GIF image. Be
sure that you are familiar with the process for downloading graphics
files. If not, refer to <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/help-dl.html">this reference
sheet</A>.
<li>Next, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/msh.gif">view and save the image</a>
<li>Open the <tt>msh.html</tt> file in the text editor.
<li>Modify the text to include a link to the graphic above.
<pre>
     The towering pine trees of this once-quiet mountain 
     were &lt;a href="msh.gif"&gt;toppled over like toys&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
     
<li><b>Save</b> the <tt>msh.html</tt> file and <b>Reload</b> in
your web browser
<li>Now click on the link you just created in the step (3). 
<li>A picture of blown down trees should be displayed.
</ol>

<h3>Links to other directories</h3>
The <tt>anchor</tt> tags can also link to an HTML document or graphic
file in another directory/folder in relation to the document that
contains the anchor. For example, in our lesson, we may wish to keep
all of the graphics in a special directory/folder called
<tt>pictures</tt>:
<p>
<ol>
<li>From your computer system, create a sub-directory/folder called
<tt>pictures</tt> in the same location where your
<tt>Volc.html</tt> file is stored.
<li>Move the <tt>msh.gif</tt> file to this new
sub-directory/folder.
<li>Open the <tt>msh.html</tt> file in your text editor.
<li>Edit the <tt>anchor</tt> tag for the graphic to read:
<pre>
     The towering pine trees of this once-quiet mountain 
     were &lt;a href="pictures/msh.gif"&gt;toppled over 
     like toys&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>NOTE: With HTML you can direct your web browser to open any
document/graphic at a directory level <i>lower</i> then the present document by using
the "/" character to indicate the change to a lower directory called "pictures."</b></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li>Save the HTML document and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>
<p>
If all went well, the link in the sentence describing the blown-down
trees should now call up the graphic file stored in the
<tt>pictures</tt> sub-directory/folder. 

<H2>Anchor Links to a Higher Level Directory</H2>
The types of links we have constructed here are known as "relative" links, meaning a web browser can construct the full URL based upon the current location of the HTML page and the link information in the <TT>&lt;a href=...&gt;</TT> tags. This is very powerful because you can build all your web pages on one computer, test them, and move them to another computer- all the relative links will stay intact.
<p>
In this lesson we saw how to construct a hyperlink to a document that is stored in a directory <b>lower</b> than the working HTML page. Note that you can also construct a link that connects to a <b>higher</b> level directory as well by using this HTML:
<PRE>  &lt;a href=&quot;../../home.html&quot;&gt;return to home&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>
 Each instance of <TT>"../"</TT> the URL of an anchor link tells the web browser to go to a higher level directory relative to the current page; in this case to go up two directory levels and look for a file called <TT>home.html</TT>.
<p>
In our example, let's say that our <TT>pictures</TT> sub directory was not in the same directory/folder as the <TT>volc.html</TT> file but was actually one level higher.<p>
<IMG SRC="paths.gif" ALT="directory diagram" hspace=8 ALIGN=left WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=204>
In the previous section we constructed a link from the  <TT>volc.html</TT> file to the <TT>msh.gif</TT> file in a subdirectory:
<PRE>  &lt;img src=&quot;pictures/msh.gif&quot;&gt;</PRE>

Now, we want to reorganize our web structure so that the pictures folder/directory is at a higher level. The link is now written:
<PRE>  &lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/msh.gif&quot;&gt;</PRE>
so the web browser looks for a folder called "pictures" that is stored one level up from our <TT>volc.html</TT> file.
<br clear=all>
<p>
An advantage of this structure is that it would be easier to store a large number of graphics in this upper folder/directory that can be shared in other web pages. We may do another lesson on landforms that makes use of the pictures stored in this folder/directory.
<p>
So now it is time to do a little re-organizing our our HTML files. This requires that you are familiar with moving files and directories around on your computer.
<ol>
<li>First, create a new folder/directory and name it <TT>volcano</TT> 
(it is recommended to keep the file names in all lower case).
<li>Now, move the two HTML files <TT>volc.html</TT> and <TT>msh.html</TT> into this new folder/directory.
<li>Move the <TT>pictures</TT> folder/directory (along with the <TT>msh.gif</TT> file inside) so that it is in the <b>same</b> level as the new <TT>volcano</TT> folder/directory. Also, move the <TT>lava.gif</TT> file that we added in <A HREF="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</A> into the pictures folder.
<li>So your entire <TT>workarea</TT> directory should now contain two subdirectories- one that holds your HTML files (<TT>volcano</TT>) and one that holds the graphics (<TT>pictures</TT>)
<li>We've moved some things around so now we will have to go the link information inside our HTML files. First, look at the first local link we built in the <TT>volc.html</TT> file:
<pre>
  &lt;h3&gt;Mount St Helens&lt;/h3&gt;
  On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, this quiet
  mountain in Washington provided &lt;a href=&quot;msh.html&quot;&gt;detailed
  observations&lt;/a&gt; on the mechanics of highly explosive
  eruptions.
</pre>

<B><BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE: Since the <TT>msh.html</TT> file is still in the same relative directory as volc.html, we do not have to change any of this HTML! Can you see how relative file linking is one of the powerful features of HTML?</BLOCKQUOTE></B>
<li>But now let's look at the link to the picture of Mt. St Helens that we created in the <TT>msh.html</TT> file:
<PRE>  The towering pine trees of this once-quiet mountain 
  were &lt;a href=&quot;pictures/msh.gif&quot;&gt;toppled over 
  like toys&lt;/a&gt;.</PRE>

Open this file in your text editor and edit the link to read:
<PRE>  The towering pine trees of this once-quiet mountain 
  were &lt;a href=&quot;../pictures/msh.gif&quot;&gt;toppled over 
  like toys&lt;/a&gt;.</PRE>
This relative link tells the web browser to go up one level from the current folder/directory (<tt>volcano</tt>) and look there for another folder/directory called <tt>pictures</tt> that contains a GIF image called <tt>msh.gif</tt>
<li>Lastly, you will have to update the <TT>&lt;img...</TT>> tag that displays the title graphic. Open the <TT>volc.html</TT> file in your text editor and modify the line just below the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to read:
<PRE>  &lt;img alt=&quot;A Lesson on:&quot; src=&quot;../pictures/lava.gif&quot;&gt;</PRE>

<li>Save your file. You should then <b>Open</b> the <TT>volc.html</TT> file in your web browser and verify the link to <TT>msh.html</TT> and then the link to the picture of Mount St Helens.
</ol>
<H2>One More Small Change</H2>
This last small step may not be obvious, but we will explain it shortly. The last thing you should do in this lesson is to change the name of your working file from <TT>volc.html</TT> to <TT>index.html</TT>
<p>
Why? Let's say you have finished this lesson and are ready to store it on a World Wide Web server for the world to see. And let's assume that the Internet address for this server at Big University is:
<pre>    http://www.bigu.edu/</pre>

And your file will be stored in a series of directories:
<pre>
--= top level of server: www.bigu.edu
   /courses
        /science
            /geology</pre>
so that the URL for the Volcano Web might be:
<pre>    http://www.bigu.edu/courses/science/geology/volcano/volc.html</pre>                 
Pretty long, eh? Now here is the promised explanation- on most WWW servers you can designate one standard name that is the "default" web page for that directory and on most systems that name is.... <TT>index.html</TT>. What this means is that the Internet address:
<pre>    http://www.bigu.edu/courses/science/geology/volcano/</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>    http://www.bigu.edu/courses/science/geology/volcano/index.html</pre>
This might make you think that it is a lot of energy to cut 20 letters out of a URL! But it does tend to make your URL look a bit more professional- If you were creating the Longhorn Cheese Home page,
<pre>    http://www.cheese.com/longhorn/</pre>
looks less redundant in print than
<pre>    http://www.cheese.com/longhorn/longhorn.html</pre>
which comes into play when people read about your URL and are trying to connect by typing it into their web browser.
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web page with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8a_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. You will
first see your <i>Volcano Web</i> page. When you click on the
hypertext for <u>detailed observations</u>, your web browser will display a new
page. Finally, when you click on <tt><B>toppled over like toys</B></tt>,
your web browser will display in an external window a picture file that is
stored in a sub folder/directory.
<p>
Use the web browser's <b>back</b> button twice to return to this page. If your
web page was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor.
<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What were the steps you used in creating a link within your
document to a local file?
<li>What steps did you use to create a link which displayed a
graphic in an external window?
<li>How did you create a link to a file in a lower directory/folder than
your main document? a higher directory?
<li>What is the significance of a file called <TT>index.html</TT> on a WWW server?
</ol>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Create a second HTML document that uses the HTML formatting that you are
familiar with at this point. Return to the first one you created and
make an anchor that links to this new one.
<hr>
<h2> Coming Next....</h2>
In the next lesson you will learn how use the HTML for
linking to resources on the Internet - the "URL" or "Uniform Resource
Locator".

<h1>8b. URLs- Pointers to the Internet</h1>
Now it is time to include links to information available on the
Internet, using the World Wide Web's addressing scheme.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the function of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
<li>Recognize the structure of a URL
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: For this lesson, you will not need your HTML text file.</b>
This is another low effort lesson!

<h3>What is a URL?</h3>
The <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">Uniform
Resource Locator (URL)</a> is what the WWW uses to find the location
of files and documents from computers on the Internet. On your web browser
screen, the URL for this document is typically displayed in the upper part of
the Web browser window. The URL includes:
<ul>
<li>an identifier for the type of Internet server;
<li>an Internet address; and
<li>a file path to the particular item of interest.
</ul>
<p>
The URL is what you will need to build a link from the web page that 
you are creating to connect to some other piece of information
available on the Internet. For more information, see
<a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/links/Curling-up-2-URLs.html">
Curling Up To URLs (v0.2)</a>

<h3>How are URLs Structured?</h3>
The structure of a URL is:
<pre>     type://in.ter.net.address/directory/sub-directory/.../filename
</pre>
The <tt>"type"</tt> indicates the type of Internet server being
accessed:
<dl>
<dt><b>http</b>
<dd> A World Wide Web server that provides World Wide Web documents. "HTTP"
stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.<p>
<dt><b>gopher</b>
<dd> an Internet Gopher site, menu driven directories of files and
information<p>
<dt><b>ftp</b>
<dd>An anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site, archives of
files<p>
<dt><b>telnet</b>
<dd>Initiates a Telnet session to log on remotely to another
computer. When selected, your web browser will launch a Telnet external program
and connect to the specified site.<p>
<dt><b>WAIS</b>
<dd>Wide Area Indexed Server- a site to search a collection of
subject oriented documents by keywords<p>
<dt><b>file</b>
<dd>A file on your local computer system (hard drive, floppy, local
file server)
</dl>
<p>
The <tt>type</tt> is always followed by "://" and the Internet address
of a remote computer. This is in the structure of:
<pre>
     host.domain.domain.domain
</pre>
For example:
<pre>
     machine.department.college.edu
     123.45.6.78
     company.com
     agency.branch.gov
     machine.organization.country     
</pre>
If the URL is to the main level of this host (its "home page"), then the URL is
terminated with a slash "/". If you are linking to a
sub-directory or a file, you must also add the exact path to that
item using the slash character to indicate the entire file path.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note: For most web servers spelling does count! So does capitalization!
File names on UNIX computers are case sensitive, meaning that a file
named
<pre>     SpiffyText.html
</pre>

is a different file than  
<pre>     spiffytext.html
</pre></B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<h3>Experimenting With URLs</h3>
Note that URLs can link to any site, directory, subdirectory,
text file, image, digital movie, or sound file on any Internet site
that is set up for public access. From the list below, look at the
URL and then see what happens when you select an <tt>anchor</tt> tag
that uses the URL:
<p>
<h4>Sample URLs</h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>http</b>
<dd><a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/">http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/</a>
MCLI's WWW server 
<dd><a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/laby-forum.html">

<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>What purpose do URLs serve for the World Wide Web? 
<li>Where are URLs found on a WWW screen? 
<li>What is the basic structure of an URL?
<li>What are some different servers that can be accessed using URLs?
</ol>
<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Find some sites on the Internet that intrigue you. For each one,
record its name and its URL displayed near the top of your browser
window. (or better yet-- learn how to use the
<B>Bookmark</B> or <B>Hotlist</B> features of your browser). You will use this list later to add anchor links from your
own web pages to these sites that you found. Or better yet, 
investigate the Bookmarks or Hotlist features of your Web
browser.

<hr>
<h2> Coming Next....</h2>
You will use URLs in <tt>anchor</tt> tags to create links to file
Internet for your <i>Volcano Web</i> page.

<h1>8c. Links to the World- Internet Sites</h1>
You've been revving your engines, and itching to hit the 
<a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/GIFs/infohwy.jpg">Information
SuperHighway</a>, right? Here, we will extend our use of
<tt>anchor</tt> tags to create links to resources out there on the
Internet.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create an anchor to link to an Internet site.
<li>Quickly copy the URL for a site and use it in your HTML document.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8cget.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>


<h3>HTML for Anchors to the Internet</h3>
Linking to a site on the Internet combines what we have worked on
earlier in the lessons on <b>Links to Local Files</b> (<a
href="tut8a.html">Lesson 8a</a>) by incorporating what we have
learned about  <b>URLs</b> (<a href="tut8b.html">Lesson 8b</a>). The
full HTML format for an <tt>anchor</tt> link to an item on the
Internet is:
<pre>
     &lt;a href="URL"&gt;Text to Activate Link&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
where <b><tt>URL</tt></b> is the full Uniform Resource Locator, in quotes,
the address for the Internet site where you want to send the viewer. 
The string <tt>Text to Activate Link</tt> is what will show up as hypertext
in your web browser (usually but not always) underlined and in blue. 
When a viewer clicks on this hypertext, the web browser will link
them to the Internet site indicated by the URL. Remember that a URL
can be a link to another World Wide Web (WWW) server, Gopher
server, FTP site, or any text, graphic, sound, video file on these
servers.
<p>
Now, we will add a hypertext link to a NASA site that has information about
volcanoes on the planet Mars. Follow these directions to add anchor
links on your HTML document:
<p><ol>
<li>Open your <tt>index.html</tt> file in the text editor.
<li>Below the heading, <b>Volcanic Places on Mars</b>, enter

<h3>A Quick 'n Easy Way to Enter URLs in Anchor Tags</h3>
As you navigate among documents in the WWW, the URL of the currently
visible page can be displayed at the top of the web browser window 
(You may have to look for a menu option to <B>Display URLs</B>). For
example, in this document, the URL looks something like:
<pre>
   http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8c.html
</pre>
You can use your mouse to select and <b>copy</b> a URL from the
web browser display and then paste it in the <tt>anchor</tt> tag of your
HTML document. This is much more efficient than writing URLs down
on paper (some are quire long!). You can also use the bookmark or hotlist features of your
web browser. Or, you can keep a text document available where you can
cut and paste new URLs.
<p>
Now we will add some links to other sites that we will list under the
<B>References</B> section of our Volcano lesson. One such site that might
offer relevant information is the US Geological Survey. 
<p>
Follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Connect to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/education/index.html">
US Geological Survey Education Index.</a>
<li>From the web page, use the mouse to <b>Select</b> the URL as displayed 
in the URL display field. 
<li>From the <b>Edit</b> menu, <b>Copy</b> the URL. 
<li>Open your HTML document in the text editor
<li>Under the heading "References", enter:
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=""&gt;Educational Resources from the
USGS&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<li>Click the mouse once between the two quote marks and <b>Paste</b>
the text you copied in step (3) The final <tt>anchor</tt> tag should
look like:
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/education/index.html"&gt; 
Educational Resources from the USGS&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Note: You have just set up the HTML structure for an
Unordered List, with each list item a hypertext link to a site that offers
information about volcanoes. For a review of Lists, see <a
href="tut6.html">lesson 6</a></b>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</ol>
<p>
<B>NOTE:</B> Users of NetScape can get URLs in another way. For Macintosh versions, just hold the mouse down on any
hypertext on a web page and when the popup menu appears, select 
<B>Copy This Link Location</B>. In the Windows version, hold down the right
mouse button to get this same menu. Now you can just paste the URL in your
HTML documents.
<p>
For additional practice, explore some of the following Internet
sites with resources Geology and/or Volcanoes. Add at least two
more items to your <B>Reference</B> section:

<h1>8d. Links to Sections of a Page</h1>
You have seen how to link to other web pages, whether
they are ones you created or have found elsewhere on the
Internet. What if you wanted to connect to a specific
section <b>within</b> a document? YOU CAN!
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Create a hidden reference marker for a particular 
section within an HTML file.
<li>Build a hypertext link that will connect to a particular 
section within an HTML file.
<li>Build a hypertext link that will connect to a particular 
section within another HTML file.
<li>Create a hypertext table of contents for a web page.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working document from the previous
lesson, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8dget.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>

<A NAME="na"><h3>The Named Anchor</h3></A>
A <B>named anchor</B> is a hidden reference marker
for a particular section of your HTML file. This might be used
to link to a different section of the same page (like quickly
scrolling) or to a marked section of another page. For example,
on this page you are viewing, I could create a hidden marker
called "check" that marked the heading below "Check Your Work".
Then, I write an anchor link that connects to this section 
of this document. Once you click on a link to this named anchor, 
your web browser will jump so this line is at the top of the screen.
<P>
Here is an example you can try right now. 
Go to <A HREF="#check">Check Your Work</A> and when you get
there look for a link that will return you to this section.
<P>
The HTML format for creating the named anchor is:
<pre>
     &lt;a name="NAME"&gt;Text to Link To&lt;/a&gt; 
</pre>
or for the link you just tried above:
<pre>
     &lt;a name="check"&gt;Check Your Work&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

Notice how this subtly differs from the anchor link <TT>&lt;a href=...</TT>
that we learned about in <A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A>.

<H3>Writing a Link to a Named Anchor</H3>
When you want to create an hypertext link (or an "anchor link", see
<A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A>) to a named anchor, use the following HTML:
<pre>
     &lt;a href="#xxxxx"&gt;Text to act as hypertext&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

or for the link you just tried that sent you to the section below:
<pre>
     Go to  &lt;a href="#check"&gt;Check Your Work&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
The "#" symbol instructs your web browser to look through the HTML document for
a named anchor called <TT>"xxxxxx"</TT> or in our example <TT>"check"</TT>. 
When you select or click on the hypertext, it brings the part of the document that contains the named anchor to the top of the screen.

<H3>Adding Named Anchors to the <I>Volcano Web</I> Lesson</H3>
Now, we will build a table of contents for our lesson that will appear at the top
of our <I>Volcano Web</I> page. The entries for this will be the headings
we have already created. Each will act as a hypertext link to a particular
section of our lesson.
<p>
The first step is to create a named anchor for each of the heading
sections in your <I>Volcano Web</I> lesson:
<ol>
<li>Open your <tt>index.html</tt> file in the text editor
<li>Find the heading for the <B>Introduction</B>. Change it from:
<pre>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
so that it looks like:
<pre>
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="intro"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: You have just marked the line that 
contains the header "Introduction"
with a hidden reference marker, the named anchor "intro"</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>In a similar manner, change all header level 2 (&lt;h2&gt;) tags 
for the other sections:
<pre>
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;A NAME="term"&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;A NAME="usa"&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;A NAME="mars"&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;A NAME="project"&gt;Research Project&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>
<li>If you <B>Reload</B> now from your web browser, you will not notice any visible changes;
the named anchor tags we have just added are hidden from the users view.
</ol>

<H3>Adding Links to a Named Anchor in the Same Document</H3>
Now we will set up a table of contents that will appear at the top of the screen.
We will use an unordered list (see <A HREF="tut6.html">lesson 6</A> 
for more on lists) to create this list:
<ol>
<li>If not already open, open your <tt>index.html</tt> file in the text
editor.
<li>Below the first sentence under the <B>Volcano Web</B> 
heading enter the following text:
<pre>
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;B&gt;In this Lesson...&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction
&lt;li&gt;Volcano Terminology
&lt;li&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA
&lt;li&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars
&lt;li&gt;Research Project&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: This index is marked off above and below by a solid line
using the 
&lt;hr&gt; tag. The <I>Italic</I> style is used on the entries for the text.
At this point we have only entered the text of the index entries. Below we
will add the HTML to make the links active.
</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> into in your web browser.
</ol>
Finally, we want to make each item of the list act as a
hypertext link to another section of the document. To do
this, we will use a variation of the basic anchor link 
<A HREF="tut8a.html">lessons 8a</A>. Rather then linking to another file, we link
to one of the named anchors within the file. We indicate a named anchor by
preceding the reference marker name with a "#" symbol:
<ol>
<li>Open your <tt>index.html</tt> file in the text editor
<li>Go to the first list item in your index section. Change it from:
<pre>
    &lt;li&gt;Introduction
</pre>
to look like:
<pre>
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#intro"&gt;Introduction&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
<li>You should now be able to fill in the other links to named anchors
so that the section now looks like:
<pre>
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;B&gt;In this Lesson...&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#intro"&gt;Introduction&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#term"&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#usa"&gt;Volcanic Places in the USA&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#mars"&gt;Volcanic Places on Mars&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF="#project"&gt;Research Project&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> into your web browser. When you click on an 
item in your index, the browser should display the associated section
at the top of your screen.
</ol>

<H3>Adding Links to a Named Anchor in Another Document</H3>
You can create a link that jumps to a section of another
HTML document that is marked by a named anchor. 
The HTML for building a link to a named anchor in another
HTML document is:
<pre>
     &lt;a href=file.html#NAME&gt;Text to activate link&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

In <A HREF="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</A> 
we created an hypertext link that jumped from the section of our lesson on 
Mount St. Helens to <tt>msh.html</tt>, a separate HTML file. Now we will add
a link in that second document that will return to the original section of the
main Volcano page.
<ol>
<li>Open your <tt>msh.html</tt> file in the text editor
<li>Near the bottom of the HTML (but above the <TT>&lt;/body&gt;</TT> tag)  
enter the following text:
<pre>
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a href="index.html#usa"&gt;Return to &lt;i&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We have included the <I>Italic</I> Style tag 
&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; within
the text marked by the named anchor "usa".</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li><B>Save</B> and <B>Reload</B> into your web browser. When you click on one of
the hypertext at the bottom of the <tt>msh.html</tt> page, 
you should jump back to the "Volcanic Places in the USA" 
section of the <I>Volcano Web</I> lesson.
</ol>

In this case the link is just the name of another HTML file,
<tt>msh.html</tt>, 
in the same directory as the <tt>index.html</tt> file. 
However, you can use a full URL (see <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut7.html">lesson 7</A>) to link to a named
anchor in an HTML file on a remote computer. 
For example, to create a link to the "Introduction"
section of an HTML file stored on the MCLI WWW server, the syntax would be:
<pre>
   &lt;a href=http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/index.html#intro&gt;
      Introduction to Volcano Web&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

The reference marker <TT>"#anchor_name"</TT> is tacked onto the end of the URL.

<hr>
<A NAME="check"><h2>Check Your Work</h2></A>
Compare your web page with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8d_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
web page was different than the sample or the named anchor links do not
properly connect, review the text you entered in the
text editor.
<P>
Example of using the link to <A HREF="#na">return to section</A> 
on describing the named anchor...

<h2>Review Topics</h2>
<ol>
<li>How do you identify a named anchor?
<li>What are the steps for creating a link to different section within a document?

<h1>8e. HyperGraphics</h1>
Text does not have a monopoly on being "hyper"...
expand the versatility of your web pages by having
<b>pictures</b> act as hyperlinks.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Insert a graphic button in your web page that links to
another HTML document.
<li>Insert a small graphic that acts as a "postage stamp" button for a link to
display a larger copy of the image.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8eget.html">download a copy</a> now.</b>

<h3>A HyperLink Button</h3>
From the previous lessons, you have (hopefully) become comfortable
with creating hypertext, text within your documents that connects a
viewer to related information. You can also use inline images 
(see <a href="tut7a.html">Lesson 7a</a>) to act in a "hyper" manner. If you
recall, in an earlier lesson we linked some text in our
<i>Volcano Web</i>  page, <tt>index.html</tt>, to a second page,
<tt>msh.html</tt>, that described Mount St. Helens. Now in the
latter page, we want to add a button that when clicked will link a
reader back to the main lesson page.
<p>
The way to do this is to put the HTML tags for inline images
<i>within</i> the hypertext portion of the anchor tag:
<pre>
   &lt;a href="fileX.html"&gt; &lt;img src="graphic.gif"&gt;
   Go to Document X&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
In your web page, this HTML  will display an inline image and the
text <tt>Go to Document X</tt>. Both will act as hyperlinks;
clicking on either the text or the picture will tell your web browser to go to
the HTML file <tt>fileX.html</tt>. The image alone
could be a hyperlink. In the World Wide Web, a "HyperGraphic" generally 
is surrounded by a colored box matching the color of hypertext on your web page, 
so you know that it is "active".

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: Many browsers now can alter the color of hypertext and some pages have
suppressed the display of the outline around HyperGraphic links. Generally, you can
identify a hyperlink area on a web page by looking for a change in the cursor as
it passes over a "hot" region.
<p>
From a design standpoint, we recommend that if you use pictures to act as hyperlinks
that you offer also a text link or use the ALT= attribute in the &lt;IMG...&gt; tag in case
the viewer has turned off the loading of images.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now we will create a "hyper" graphic button. First, you need to get a copy of this 
arrow button: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><img alt="--" src="left.gif"></BLOCKQUOTE> 
If you need help for
saving image files, see the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/help-dl.html">
reference page on downloading</A>. When you are ready, view and
save the <a href="left.gif">arrow button GIF file</a> as a file named 
<tt>left.gif</tt>.
<p>
You should now have a copy of the file somewhere
on your computer (You should move it to the <TT>pictures</TT> folder/directory). 
<p>
Next, add the HTML to make the button work:
<ol>
<li>Open the second HTML file, <tt>msh.html</tt> in your text
editor.
<li>At the bottom, modify the last line to:
<pre>
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a href="index.html"&gt; &lt;img src="../pictures/left.gif"&gt; 
Return to &lt;i&gt;Volcano Web&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Note: The <tt>inline</tt> image tag (&lt;img...&gt;) 
is completely
within the anchor between the <TT>&gt;</TT> that marks the end of the URL and
the <TT>&lt;/a&gt;</TT> that marks the end of the hyperText. Also note how the
<TT>&lt;i&gt;</TT> tag is used within the active hypertext to emphasize the
title of the lesson. And finally, we have used the<TT> &lt;hr&gt;</TT> tag
to put a hard rule or a line above the button graphic 
(for more on this tag see <A HREF="tut4.html">lesson 4</A>).</b>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<li><b>Save</b> the HTML file.
<li>Return to your web browser, and select <b>Open Local</b> from the
<b>File</b> menu to read in the <tt>"msh.html"</tt> file.
<li>Select <b>Reload</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to update the
changes.
<li>Test the hyperlink to the Mount St. Helens page and the new
button that should return you to the <i>Volcano Web</i> page.
</ol>

<h3>"Postage Stamp" Images</h3>
Previously, we advised against using large inline images in your
web pages because viewers might wait a long time for images
to download to their computer. One way around this is to
create miniature size copies of the graphic, or "postage stamps" which
are displayed as inline graphics. Then, using the same steps as
above, you can make the "postage stamp" image act as a hyperlink that links
to the full size image. In this way, the large images are downloaded
<b>only</b> if the viewer decides to see it.
<p>
We will now add a postage stamp image that links to a larger picture:
If you would like, first preview the 
<a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/stamp.gif">postage stamp GIF image</a> and the 
<a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/seismo.jpg">Full size JPEG image</a>.
<p>
First, you need to get a copy of the two image files. 
If you need help on
saving graphics files, see the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/help-dl.html">
reference page on downloading</A>. When you are ready,
save the <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/stamp.gif">postage stamp GIF image</a> as a 
file called <TT>"stamp.gif"</TT> 
and the <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/seismo.jpg">full size JPEG image</a> as a file
called <TT>seismo.jpg</TT> (These files should be stored in your <TT>pictures</TT> folder/directory).
<p>
Next, create the postage stamp link in your main text file:
<ol>
<li>Open the <tt>index.html</tt> file in your text editor.
<li>Under the heading <B>Long Valley</B> enter the following:
<pre>
  This field seismometer measures earthquakes associated 
  with subsurface volcanic forces and may help to predict 
  future events. It sits on a plateau known as the "Volcanic 
  Tableland" formed by a major eruption  600,000 years ago.
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href="../pictures/seismo.jpg"&gt; &lt;img src="../pictures/stamp.gif"&gt;
  -- [full size image] -- &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  This seismometer measures earthquakes 
  associated with subsurface volcanic forces.
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>The inline image, <tt>stamp.gif</tt> acts as a hyperLink
to a  larger image, <tt>seismo.jpg</tt>. When a user clicks on either
the "postage stamp" or the text "Click to view full size image
--", your web browser will display the larger image in an external
window or in a blank page.</b></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li><b>Save</b> and <b>Reload</b> in your web browser.
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web page with a <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut8e_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how this document should appear. If your
web page was different than the sample, review the text you
entered in the text editor. Some of the more common mistakes are 
discrepancies between spelling of the file names and the HTML or not having
the image files in the same directory as the HTML files.

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>How did you create the graphic button in your web page? 
<li>How are "postage stamp" links useful in including graphics in
your web page? 
<li>How did you create your "postage stamp" link in your
document?

</ol>
<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Try to add  buttons that links two web pages to each other.

<h1>23. Clickable Image Maps</h1>
<font size=+1>Make different <b>parts</b> of an inline image hyper-active with Client-Side Image Maps...</font>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
After this lesson you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Understand the difference between server-side and client-side processes
<li>Create an inline image that has different portions hyperlinked to other web pages, pictures, and other sites on the Internet
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<b>Note: If you do not have the working documents from the previous
lessons, <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut23get.html">download a copy</a> now. Also, you may want to first look at the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut23_ex/test.html">test</A> page to see of your browser supports the tags used in this lesson</b>
<p>
In <A HREF="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</A> we learned how to write the HTML to place an inline image in our page and in <A HREF="tut8e.html">lesson 8e</A> we saw how we could make the entire picture act as a hyperlink to some other related item. Since the early days of the web, there has been a way to have different parts of an inline image be hyperlinked-- known as a "clickable image map". One of our favorite examples was the Hall of Dinosaurs from the Berkeley Paleontology museum.
<p>
<b>But</b> until recently, the clickable image maps required that some things be processed from the web server. This is how it worked:
<ol>
<li>Viewer sees page with clickable image map and... clicks on the part of it in the lower right hand corner.
<li>Web browser says, "Hey! I got a mouseclick in this image! Gotta send a message to the web server- Someone clicked at these coordinates of this image."
<li>The web server says."Hmmm. I got these coordinates for this image- The HTML file it was called from says look up the coordinates in this file... Okay, the file says, if the coordinates are in this rectangular region, then send the viewer to this URL"
The server then returns this information to the web browser.
<li>Web browser says,"Okay! The server said go to this URL- Let's go!"
</ol>

This is a <b>server-side</b> process; one that was really not that inefficient and a web server could handle it in a split second. But it meant that to use clickable image maps one always had to have access to a web server.
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.spyglass.com/">Spyglass</A> was the first browser built with the capability to handle the calculations and transmit the proper URL based upon coordinates that were built inside the HTML for a page. This is a <b>client-side</b> process. That entire conversation above now takes place just between the browser and itself!
<p>
The HTML needed for a client-side clickable image map is:
<pre>  &lt;img src=&quot;image.gif&quot; usemap=&quot;#map_name&quot;&gt;</pre>
where <tt>image.gif</tt> is the file name of the image and <tt>map_name</tt> is an anchor link (see <A HREF="tut8d.html">lesson 8d</A>) elsewhere in the same HTML file:
<pre>  &lt;map name=&quot;map_name&quot;&gt;
  &lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; coords=&quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot; HREF=URL1&gt;
  &lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; coords=&quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot; HREF=URL2&gt;
         :
         :
   &lt;/map&gt;</pre>
Each line in the <TT>&lt;map&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;</TT> tag identifies a different "hot" region, specified by the coordinates, <tt>coords=</tt>. <TT>x1,y1</TT> are the horizontal and vertical pixel locations for the upper left corner (relative to the upper left corner of the entire image), while <TT>x2,y2</TT> are the horizontal and vertical pixel locations for the lower right corner. <TT>URL1, URL2, ...</TT> are the URLs (or file names for local files) that the region should correspond to when clicked.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: To identify the coordinates for the hot region you will have to use some sort of graphics program. 
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Imagemaps/">Yahoo</A> lists several other utility programs that make this easy to do. For this lesson, we will be providing the exact coordinates for you.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In this lesson we are going to add to our <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut22_ex/term.html">Volcano Terminology</A> page (file <TT>term.html</TT>) a picture showing different kinds of volcanic eruptions. Each one will be hyperlinked to an external web site. In addition we will create two more links to our own (local) files.
<ol>
<li>First, you will need to download a copy of the image file we are using. If you need help, refer to the <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/help-dl.html">instructions</A> for downloading graphics files. When you are ready, use the link below to view/download the image:<p>
<A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/pictures/volc.jpg"><IMG SRC="left.gif" ALT="o " 
WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60 align=middle border=0>
volcano types image</A><p>
Save this file as <tt>volc.jpg</tt> and make sure that you store it in your <tt>pictures</tt> folder/subdirectory. 
<p>
<li>Open your <TT>term.html</TT> file in your text editor.
<p>
<li>Below the last paragraph ("...a historically active volcano on
the island of Martinique. &lt;p&gt;"), add this HTML:
<pre>
There are many different types of volcanic eruptions and 
landforms. They can be classified according to the degree 
of &quot;explosiveness&quot; and the height of the eruption column:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;font size=+2&gt;
Investigate each type by clicking on a picture
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/volc.jpg&quot; usemap=&quot;#volcmap&quot; border=0&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: We have inserted an inline image that will reference a set of coordinates
associated with the name "volcmap". The <TT>&lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt;</TT> tag aligns the image in the middle of the page (see <A HREF="tut20.html">lesson 20</A>). The <TT>border=0</TT> attribute inside the <TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag suppresses the display of a hypertext box around the image.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<li>Next we will add the HTML for the map coordinates. This can be placed anywhere within the HTML document- it is HTML that is <b>not</b> displayed in the web browser. We suggest just adding it below the HTML you added in the previous step:

<pre>&lt;map name=&quot;volcmap&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot;
 href=&quot;http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/frequent_questions/grp7/europe/question308.html&quot; 
   coords=&quot;48,46,204,153&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;explode.html&quot; 
   coords=&quot;0,66,26,227&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;height.html&quot; 
   coords=&quot;95,283,378,309&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/pinatubo/&quot;  
   coords=&quot;321,154,468,261&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~boris/STROMBOLI_main.html&quot; 
   coords=&quot;172,155,318,274&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/hvo/&quot; 
   coords=&quot;36,155,168,276&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; href=&quot;http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/santamaria/&quot; 
   coords=&quot;90,3,343,123&quot;&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE: You should see that 5 of the 7 defined areas connect to remote internet sites. The two others are local documents that we will create in the next step.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<li>Save your <tt>term.html</tt> file.
<p>
<li>We now have to create two more HTML files that will be linked from the image map. Create a new document in your text editor and place in it:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Explosiveness&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#000000 TEXT=#EEEEBB

&lt;A HREF=&quot;term.html&quot;&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt; / 
&lt;/H5&gt;

&lt;h1 align=center&gt;Explosiveness&lt;/h1&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;explosiveness&lt;/b&gt; of an observed volcanic 
eruption is estimated by the calculated force of 
the eruption. Experiments have shown that when water 
comes in contact with hot magma, the eruption is 
much stronger- this is known as &lt;b&gt;hydro-volcanism&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
For pre-historic eruptions, the explosiveness is estimated 
by the degree of fragmentation of small volcanic particles. 
A more explosive eruption will &quot;shatter&quot; volcanic tephra 
much more then a less explosive eruption.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;term.html&quot;&gt;

&lt;/H5&gt;

&lt;h1 align=center&gt;Height of Eruption Column&lt;/h1&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt; of a volcanic eruption cloud 
(in kilometers) is taken from direct observation 
or from estimates based upon historic accounts. 
&lt;p&gt;
For pre-historic eruptions, this scale is calculated 
based upon the &lt;b&gt;dispersal&lt;/b&gt; of the volcanic products- 
i.e how far and wide they are scattered. Volcanic 
eruptions that have very tall columns will spread 
tephra far and wide.
&lt;p&gt;

</pre>
Save this document in the same directory as your other HTML files and call it <tt>height.html</tt>
<p>
<li>Now open the <tt>term.html</tt> file in your web browser. The image of the different volcanoes should appear and as you move the mouse over the different regions of the image, the cursor should change to a "hand" and somewhere in the bottom of the web browser window, there should be an indicator of the URL the "hot" region will link to when clicked.
</ol>

You should compare your web page to this <A HREF="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut23_ex/map1.html">sample</A> of how your clickable image page should look. 


<h2>Covering Your Bases</h2>
Given that this is a rather new development in HTML, you should be thinking of allowing for viewers using a web browser that does not support client-side image maps. NetScape's documentation provides some examples for handling this situation. If you have access to server-side image mapping (see <A HREF="http://gnn.com/gnn/bus/ora/features/miis/index.html">Clickable Image Maps</A> by Russ Jones),  you can set it up that if the browser does not support the client-side interpretation, it will then refer to the server. We have used this approach for our clickable image map of the <A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/mcccd/">Maricopa Community Colleges</A>.
<p>
For our case we can set up a special page that has a message for web browsers that do not support client-side image maps:
<ol>
<li>First we will need to create a new HTML file called <tt>nomap.html</tt>. Open a new file in your text editor and in it put:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;No Image Map Available&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR = #000000 TEXT=#EEEEBB 
LINK=#44DDFF VLINK=#00FF88&gt;
&lt;H5&gt;Volcano Web / 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;Index&lt;/A&gt; / 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;term.html&quot;&gt;Volcano Terminology&lt;/A&gt; / 
&lt;/H5&gt;

&lt;h1 align=center&gt;Sorry!&lt;/h1&gt;
Apparently your web browser does not support 
client-side image maps. You can still reach the 
nformation by following these links:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;explode.html&quot;&gt;Explosiveness&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;height.html&quot;&gt;Height of Eruption Column&lt;/A&gt;

<h2>Check Your Work</h2>
Compare your web pages with this <a href="http://hakatai.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/tut23_ex/index.html">sample</a>
of how it should appear. If your pages are different than the sample or the hypertext links do not work correctly, review the text you entered in the text editor. 

<h2>Review</h2>
Review topics for this lesson:
<ol>
<li>What is the difference between client-side image mapping and server-side image-mapping?
<li>What does the <TT>&lt;map&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;</TT> tag do?
<li>How can you handle cases where a web browser does not understand client-side image mapping?
</ol>

<H2>More Information</H2>
Note that the reference to the coordinate information in the <TT>&lt;map&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;</TT> tags does not necessarily have to be in the same HTML document. The attribute <TT>usemap=</TT> could be linked to another HTML file- i.e.:

<pre>  &lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/buttonbar.gif&quot; usemap=&quot;maps.html#bmap3&quot;&gt;</pre>

where maps.html might be one file that contains <TT>&lt;map&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;</TT> tags for several files. Why might you do this?
<p>
Let's say you are creating several (or many) pages that will have at the top of the page an image of some buttons that are hyperlinked to different web pages. If you use this method, you could reference just one image file and one file that contains the coordinates. If you ever have to update your navigation bar (a new graphic? a change in the URL for one of the buttons?) then <b>you need only modify one file!</b> compared to modifying <TT>&lt;map&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;</TT> tags if they were inserted into every web page that used the button bar. 
<p>

<h2>Independent Practice</h2>
Identify a place in your web pages where a clickable image map would add to the interactivty or navigation of your design. Don't just throw one in for the sake of having one in there! You will have to do some work to identify the "hot" regions (you could guess if you are really desperate). Following the example in this lesson, write the HTML for the clickable image.
<hr>
<h2>Coming Next....</h2>
That's the end of the tutorial as of December 1995! Look for some even more advanced lessons in 1996. Keep practicing your HTML skills and look for ideas in the source for web pages that you like (and don't like!). Happy webbing...

<P>
Strings in C are intertwined with pointers to a large extent.
You must become familiar with the pointer concepts covered in
tutorial 9 through tutorial 12 to use C strings effectively. Once
you get used to them, however, you can often perform string manipulations
more efficiently than you can in Pascal.
<P>
A string in C is simply an array of characters. The following
line declares an array that can hold a string of up to 99 characters.
<PRE>
char str[100]; 
</PRE>

<P>
It holds characters as you would expect: <B>str[0]</B> is the
first character of the string, <B>str[1]</B> is the second character,
and so on. But why is a 100-element array unable to hold up to
100 characters? Because C uses<I> null-terminated strings</I>,
which means that the end of any string is marked by the ASCII
value 0 (the null character), which is also represented in C as
<B>'\0'</B>.
<P>
Null termination is very different from the way Pascal compilers
handle strings. In Pascal, each string consists of an array of
characters, with a length byte that keeps count of the number
of characters stored in the array. This structure gives Pascal
a definite advantage when you ask for the length of a string.
Pascal can simply return the length byte, whereas C has to count
the characters until it finds <B>'\0'</B>. This fact makes C much
slower than Pascal in certain cases, but in others it makes it
somewhat faster, as we will see in the examples below.
<P>
Because C provides no explicit support for strings in the language
itself, all of the string-handling functions are implemented in
libraries. The string I/0 operations (gets, puts, and so on) are
implemented in &lt;stdio.h&gt;, and a set of fairly simple string
manipulation functions are implemented in &lt;string.h&gt; (on
some systems, &lt;strings.h&gt; ).
<P>
The fact that strings are not native to C forces you to create
some fairly roundabout code. For example, suppose you want to
assign one string to another string; that is, you want to copy
the contents of one string to another. In Pascal, this task is
easy:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var    
    s1,s2:string;  
begin    
    s1:='hello';   
    s2:=s1;  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
In C, as we saw in tutorial 12, you cannot simply assign one array
to another. You have to copy it element by element. The string
library (&lt;string.h&gt; or &lt;strings.h&gt; ) contains a function
called <B>strcpy </B>for this task. The following code shows how
to use <B>strcpy</B> to achieve the same results in C as in the
Pascal code above:
<PRE>
#include &lt;string.h&gt; 
void main()  
{    
    char s1[100],s2[100];     
     strcpy(s1,&quot;hello&quot;); /* copy &quot;hello&quot; into s1 */    
    strcpy(s2,s1);      /* copy s1 into s2 */  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
<B>strcpy</B> is used whenever a string is initialized in C. Another
major difference between Pascal and C is the way they handle string
comparisons. In Pascal, unlike in C, string compares are built
into the language. In C, you use the <B>strcmp</B> function in
the string library, which compares two strings and returns an
integer that indicates the result of the comparison. Zero means
the two strings are equal, a negative value means that <B>s1</B>is
less than <B>s2</B>, and a positive value means <B>s1</B> is greater
than <B>s2</B>. In Pascal, the code looks like this:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var    
    s1,s2:string;  
begin    
    readln(s1);    
    readln(s2);    
    if s1=s2 then      
        writeln('equal')    
    else if (s1&lt;s2) then      
        writeln('s1 less than s2')    
    else      
        writeln('s1 greater than s2');  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
Here is the same code in C:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  
#include &lt;string.h&gt; 
void main()  
{    
    char s1[100],s2[100]; 
     gets(s1);    
    gets(s2);    
    if (strcmp(s1,s2)==0)       
        printf(&quot;equal\n&quot;);    
    else if (strcmp(s1,s2)&lt;0)      
        printf(&quot;s1 less than s2\n&quot;);    
    else      
        printf(&quot;s1 greater than s2\n&quot;);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Other common functions in the string library include <B>strlen
</B>, which returns the length of a string, and <B>strcat</B>which
concatenates two strings. The string library contains a number
of other functions, which you can peruse by reading the man page.
Note that many of the standard Pascal capabilities, such as copy,
delete, pos, and so on, are missing.
<P>
To get you started building string functions, and to help you
understand other programmers' codes-everyone seems to have his
or her own set of string functions for special purposes in a program-we
will look at two examples, <B>strlen</B> and <B>strcpy</B>. Following
is a strictly Pascal-like version of <B>strlen</B>:
<PRE>
int strlen(char s[])  
{    
    int x; 
    x=0;    
    while (s[x] != '\0') 
         x=x+1;    
    return(x);  
}  
</PRE>

<P>
Most C programmers shun this approach because it seems inefficient.
Instead, they often use a pointer-based approach:
<PRE>
int strlen(char *s)  
{    
    int x=0; 
    while (*s != '\0')    
    {      
        x++;      
        s++;    
    }    
    return(x);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
You can abbreviate this code to the following:
<PRE>
int strlen(char *s)  
{    
    int x=0; 
    while (*s++)      
        x++;    
    return(x);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
I imagine a true C expert could make this code even shorter.
<P>
When I compile these three pieces of code on a MicroVAX with gcc,
using no optimization, and run each 20,000 times on a 120-character
string, the first piece of code yields a time of 12.3 seconds,
the second 12.3 seconds, and the third 12.9 seconds. What does
this mean? To me, it means that you should write the code in whatever
way is easiest for you to understand. Pointers generally yield
faster code, but the <B>strlen</B> code above shows that that
is not always the case.
<P>
We can go through the same evolution with <B>strcpy</B>:
<PRE>
strcpy(char s1[],char s2[])  
{    
    int x; 
    for (x=0; x&lt;=strlen(s2); x++)      
        s1[x]=s2[x];  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Note here that <B>&lt;=</B> is important in the <B>for</B> loop
because the code then copies the <B>'\0'</B>. Be sure to copy
<B>'\0'</B>. Major bugs occur later on if you leave it out, because
the string has no end and therefore an unknown length. Note also
that this code is very inefficient, because <B>strlen</B> gets
called every time through the <B>for</B> loop. To solve this problem,
you could use the following code:
<PRE>
strcpy(char s1[],char s2[])  
{    
    int x,len; 
     len=strlen(s2);    
    for (x=0; x&lt;=len; x++)      
        s1[x]=s2[x];  
}
</PRE>

<P>
The pointer version is similar.
<PRE>
strcpy(char *s1,char *s2)  
{    
    while (*s2 != '\0')    
    {      
        *s1 = *s2;      
        s1++;      
        s2++;    
    }  
}
</PRE>

<P>
You can compress this code further:
<PRE>
strcpy(char *s1,char *s2)  
{    
    while (*s2)      
        *s1++ = *s2++;  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
If you wish, you can even say <B>while (*s1++ = *s2++);</B>. The
first version of <B>strcpy</B> takes 415 seconds to copy a 120-character
string 10,000 times, the second version takes 14.5 seconds, the
third version 9.8 seconds, and the fourth 10.3 seconds. As you
can see, pointers provide a significant performance boost here.
<P>
The prototype for the <B>strcpy</B> function in the string library
indicates that it is designed to return a pointer to a string:
<PRE>
char *strcpy(char *s1,char *s2) 
</PRE>

<P>
Most of the string functions return a string pointer as a result,
and <B>strcpy</B> returns the value of <B>s1</B> as its result.
<P>
Using pointers with strings can sometimes result in definite improvements
in speed and you can take advantage of these if you think about
them a little. For example, suppose you want to remove the leading
blanks from a string. To do this in Pascal, you might use the
delete function in one of two ways, the most obvious way being
the following:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var    
    s:string;  
begin    
    readln(s);    
    while (s[1] &lt;&gt; ' ') and (length(s)&gt;0) do      
        delete(s,1,1);    
    writeln(s);  
end; 
</PRE>

<P>
This is inefficient because it moves the whole array of characters
in the string over one position for each blank found at the beginning
of the string. A better way follows:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var    
    s:string;    
    x:integer;  
begin    
    readln(s);    
    x:=0;    
    while (s[x+1] &lt;&gt; ' ') and (x&lt;length(s)) do      
        x:=x+1;    
    delete(s,1,x);    
    writeln(s);  
end; 
</PRE>

<P>
With this technique, each of the letters moves only once. In C,
you can avoid the movement altogether:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  
#include &lt;string.h&gt;   
 
void main()  
{    
    char s[100],*p; 
     gets(s);    
    p=s;    
    while (*p==' ')      
        p++;    
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,p);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This is much faster than the Pascal technique, especially for
long strings.
<P>
You will pick up many other tricks with strings as you go along
and read other code. Practice is the key.
<H3>A Special Note on String Constants</H3>

<P>
Suppose you create the following two code fragments and run them:
<PRE>
Fragment 1 
 
{    
    char *s;  
    
    s=&quot;hello&quot;;    
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,s);  
} 
 
Fragment 2 
 
{    
    char s[100]; 
   
    strcpy(s,&quot;hello&quot;);    
    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,s);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
These two fragments produce the same output, but their internal
behavior is quite different. In fragment 2, you cannot say <B>s=&quot;hello&quot;;
</B>. To understand the differences, you have to understand how
the <I>string constant table</I> works in C.
<P>
When your program is compiled, the compiler forms the object code
file, which contains your machine code and a table of all the
string constants declared in the program. In fragment 1, the statement
<B>s=&quot;hello&quot;;</B> causes <B>s</B> to point to the address
of the string <B>hello</B> in the string constant table. Since
this string is in the string constant table, and therefore technically
a part of the executable code, you cannot modify it. You can only
point to it and use it in a read-only manner.
<P>
In fragment 2, the string <B>hello</B> also exists in the constant
table, so you can copy it into the array of characters named 
<B>s</B>. Since s is not a pointer, the statement <B>s=&quot;hello&quot;;
</B>will not work in fragment 2. It will not even compile.
<H3>A Special Note on Using Strings with malloc</H3>

<P>
Suppose you write the following program:
<PRE>
void main()  
{    
    char *s; 
   
    s=(char *) malloc (100);    
    s=&quot;hello&quot;;    
    free(s);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
It compiles properly, but gives a segmentation fault at the <B>free
</B>line when you run it. The <B>malloc</B> line allocates a block
100 bytes long and points s at it, but now the <B>s=&quot;hello&quot;;
</B>line is a problem. It is syntactically correct because s is
a pointer; however, when <B>s=&quot;hello&quot;;</B> is executed,
s points to the string in the string constant table and the allocated
block is orphaned. Since s is pointing into the string constant
table, the string cannot be changed; free fails because it cannot
deallocate a block in an executable region.
<P>
The correct code follows:
<PRE>
void main()  
{    
    char *s; 
     s=(char *) malloc (100);    
    strcpy(s,&quot;hello&quot;);    
    free(s);  
} 
</PRE>

<H5>C Error to Avoid</H5>

<P>
Losing the \0 character, which is easy if you aren't careful,
and can lead to some very subtle bugs. Make sure you copy \0 when
you copy strings. If you create a new string, make sure you put
\0 in it. And if you copy one string to another, make sure the
receiving string is big enough to hold the source string, including
\0. Finally, if you point a character pointer to some characters,
make sure they end with \0.

<P>
Dynamic data structures-those that grow and shrink as you need
them to by allocating and deallocating memory from the heap-are
extremely important in C. If you have never seen them before,
pick up a book on data structures so that you can learn about
them in depth.
<P>
Dynamic data structures allocate blocks of memory from the heap
as required and link those blocks together into some kind of structure
that uses pointers. When a structure no longer needs a block,
it will return it to the heap for reuse.
<P>
The following two examples show the correspondence between Pascal
code and C code using the heap. The first example allocates an
integer block, fills it, writes it, and disposes of it. In Pascal,
it looks like this:
<PRE>
program samp;  
var    
    p:^integer;  
begin    
    new(p);    
    p^:=10;    
    writeln(p^);    
    dispose(p);  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
The same code in C looks like this:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main()  
{    
    int *p; 
     p=(int *) malloc (sizeof(int));    
    *p=10;    
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,*p);    
    free(p);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
This code is really useful only for demonstrating the process
of allocating, deallocating, and using a block in C. The <B>malloc
</B> line does the same thing as the new statement does in Pascal.
It allocates a block of memory of the size specified---in this
case, <B>sizeof(int)</B> bytes. The sizeof command in C returns
the size, in bytes, of any type. The code could just as easily
have said <B>malloc(4)</B>, since <B>sizeof(int)</B> equals four
bytes on most UNIX machines. Using <B>sizeof</B>, however, makes
the code much more portable and readable.
<P>
The <B>malloc</B> function returns a pointer to the allocated
block. This pointer is generic. Using the pointer without typecasting
generally produces a type warning from the compiler. The <B>(int
*)</B> typecast converts the generic pointer returned by malloc
into a pointer to an integer, which is what <B>p</B> expects.
The dispose statement in Pascal is replaced by free in C. It returns
the specified block to the heap for reuse.
<P>
The second example illustrates the same functions as the previous
example, but it uses a record instead of an integer. In Pascal,
the code looks like this:
<PRE>
program samp;  
type    
    rec=record      
        i:integer;      
        f:real;      
        c:char;    
    end;  
var    
    p:^rec;  
begin    
    new(p);    
    p^.i:=10;    
    p^.f:=3.14;    
    p^.c='a';   
    writeln(p^.i,p^.f,p^.c);    
    dispose(p);  
end. 
</PRE>

<P>
In C, the code looks like this:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
struct rec 
{ 
    int i; 
    float f; 
    char c; 
}; 
 
void main() 
{ 
    struct rec *p; 
     p=(struct rec *) malloc (sizeof(struct rec)); 
    (*p).i=10; 
    (*p).f=3.14; 
    (*p).c='a'; 
    printf(&quot;%d %f %c\n&quot;,(*p).i,(*p).f,(*p).c); 
    free(p); 
} 
</PRE>

<P>
Note the following line:
<PRE>
 (*p).i=10; 
</PRE>

<P>
Many wonder why the following doesn't work:
<PRE>
*p.i=10; 
</PRE>

<P>
The answer has to do with the precedence of operators in C. The
result of the calculation 5+3*4 is 17, not 32, because the * operator
has higher precedence than + in most computer languages. In C,
the . operator has higher precedence than *, so parentheses force
the proper precedence. See tutorial 14 for more information on
precedence.
<P>
Most people tire of typing <B>(*p).i</B> all the time, so C provides
a shorthand notation. The following two statements are exactly
equivalent, but the second is easier to type:
<PRE>
(*p).i=10;  
p-&gt;i=10;  
</PRE>

<P>
You will see the second more often than the first when referencing
records pointed to by a pointer.
<P>
A more complex example of dynamic data structures is a simple
stack library, one that uses a dynamic list and includes functions
to init, clear, push, and pop. The library's header file looks
like this:
<PRE>
/* Stack Library -  
   This library offers the minimal stack operations for a  
   stack of integers (easily changeable) */ 
 
typedef int stack_data; 
 
extern void stack_init();  
/* Initializes this library. Call first before calling anything. */ 
 
extern void stack_clear();  
/* Clears the stack of all entries. */ 
 
extern int stack_empty();  
/* Returns 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise. */ 
 
extern void stack_push(stack_data d);  
/* Pushes the value d onto the stack. */ 
 
extern stack_data stack_pop();  
/* Returns the top element of the stack, and removes that element. 
   Returns garbage if the stack is empty. */  
</PRE>

<P>
The library's code file follows:
<PRE>
#include &quot;stack.h&quot;  
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
/* Stack Library - This library offers the minimal stack operations  
   for a stack of integers */ 
 
struct stack_rec  
{    
    stack_data data;    
    struct stack_rec *next;  
}; 
 
struct stack_rec *top=NULL; 
 
void stack_init()  
/* Initializes this library. Call before calling anything else. */  
{    
    top=NULL;  
} 
 
void stack_clear()  
/* Clears the stack of all entries. */  
{    
    stack_data x; 
  
    while (!stack_empty())      
    x=stack_pop();  
} 
 
int stack_empty()  
/* Returns 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise. */  
{    
    if (top==NULL)      
        return(1);   
    else      
        return(0);  
} 
 
void stack_push(stack_data d)  
/* Pushes the value d onto the stack. */  
{   
    struct stack_rec *temp; 
     temp=(struct stack_rec *)malloc(sizeof(struct stack_rec)); 
    temp-&gt;data=d;    
    temp-&gt;next=top;    
    top=temp;  
} 
 
stack_data stack_pop()  
/* Returns the top element of the stack, and removes that element.  
   Returns garbage if the stack is empty. */   
{    
    struct stack_rec *temp;    
    stack_data d=0; 
     if (top!=NULL)    
    {      
        d=top-&gt;data;      
        temp=top;      
        top=top-&gt;next;      
        free(temp);    
    }    
    return(d);  
}     
</PRE>

<P>
Note how this library practices information hiding: Someone who
can see only the header file cannot tell if the stack is implemented
with arrays, pointers, files, or in some other way. Note also
that C uses NULL in place of the Pascal <B>nil</B>. NULL is defined
in <B>stdio.h</B>, so you will almost always have to include 
<B>stdio.h</B> when you use pointers.
<H5>C Errors to Avoid</H5>

<UL>
<LI>Forgetting to include parentheses when you reference a record,
as in <B>(*p).i</B> above. 
<LI>Failing to dispose of any block you allocate. For example,
you should  not say <B>top=NULL</B> in the stack function, because
that action orphans blocks that need to be disposed. 
<LI>Forgetting to include <B>stdio.h</B> with any pointer operations
so that you have access to NULL. 
</UL>

<H5>Exercises</H5>

<UL>
<LI>Add a <B>dup</B>, a <B>count</B>, and an <B>add</B> function
to the stack library to duplicate the top element of the stack,
return a count of the number of elements in the stack, and add
the top two elements in the stack. 
<LI>Build a driver program and a makefile, and compile the stack
library with the driver to make sure it works.

<P>
Operator Precedence in C
<P>
C contains many operators, and because of the way in which operator
precedence works, the interactions between multiple operators
can become confusing.
<PRE>
 
x=5+3*6; 
</PRE>

<P>
X receives the value 23, not 48, because in C multiplication and
division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
<PRE>
 
char *a[10]; 
</PRE>

<P>
Is <B>a</B> a single pointer to an array of 10 characters, or
is it an array of 10 pointers to character? Unless you know the
precedence conventions in C, there is no way to find out. Similarly,
in E.11 we saw that because of precedence statements such as 
<B>*p.i = 10;</B> do not work. Instead, the form <B>(*p).i = 10;
</B>must be used to force correct precedence.
<P>
The following table from Kernigan and Richie shows the precedence
hierarchy in C. The top line has the highest precedence.

<PRE>
Operators                                   Associativity
( [ - .                                     Left to right
! - ++  -{-  + *  &amp;  (type-cast)  sizeof    Right to left
(in the above line, +, - and * are 
the unary forms) 
*  / %                                      Left to right
+  -                                        Left to right
&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;                                      Left to right
&lt;  &lt;=  &gt;  &gt;=                                Left to right
==  !=                                      Left to right
&amp;                                           Left to right
^                                           Left to right
|                                           Left to right
&amp;&amp;                                          Left to right
||                                          Left to right
?:                                          Left to right
=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  &amp;=  ^=  |=  &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;=  Right to left
,                                           Left to right 
</PRE>

<P>
Using this table, you can see that <B>char *a[10];</B> is an array
of 10 pointers to character. You can also see why the parentheses
are required if <B>(*p).i</B> is to be handled correctly. After
some practice, you will memorize most of this table, but every
now and again something will not work because you have been caught
by a subtle precedence problem.<HR>

<h1 align=center><font SIZE=+4>UCant Dance</font></h1>

<h2 align=center>(formerly The Latin Dance Club of Canterbury University)</h2>

<p>UCant Dance exists to promote social dance at Canterbury University
and Christchurch. We hold dance classes and organise regular social events.
The club welcomes non-student members. 
<br>
<br>Formerly the Latin Dance Club, UCant Dance teaches a number of different
styles of social dance. NOT Folk dance, NOT Ballroom, NOT Ballet or Jazz
dance, we teach moves you can use at a nightclub or party-yes-with a partner-yes
you. Dances include Freestyle (club music), Latin Merengue and Salsa, and
possibly Rock'n'Roll and Tango. 
<br>The dances are easy, fast, flashy, and fun. </p>

<h2>
<br>Class Times d<b><font SIZE=+2>uring 1997, beginning Monday March 10.</font></b></h2>

<p>Our classes maintain a friendly and fun atmosphere and are held at the
following times:</p>

<h3>Thursdays</h3>

<dl>
<dt>7.30-8.30pm Freestyle dance class</dt>

<dl>
<dt>A fast, flashy Rock'n'Roll based dance set to modern dance music (nightclub
style).</dt>
</dl>

<dt>8.30-9.30pm Latin class</dt>

<dd>Merengue and Salsa, danced to hypnotic rhythms from the Caribbean.</dd>

<dd>Classes will be held in the University of Canterbury Student's Association
Ballroom, 90 Ilam Rd.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Class Format and Charges</h2>

<p>Generally there is instruction for 45 minutes followed by 15 minutes
of free dancing. The style of the class depends on the individual teacher
but mostly the students are arranged in a circle with the teacher at the
centre. Partners change every few minutes with the male moving on to the
next partner in the circle.</p>

<p>Each nights attendance costs $3 for students and $5 for non-students.
You can attend as many classes as you like on a night without having to
pay twice. Club social events, trips, and parties are open to anyone. </p>

<p>
<br><font SIZE=+1>You are <blink>WELCOME</blink> to come along and check
us out any time.</font>

<P>
C on UNIX provides a fairly simple mechanism for retrieving command
line parameters entered by the user. It passes an argv parameter
to the main function in the program. argv structures appear in
a fair number of the more advanced library calls, so you should
understand them.
<P>
Enter the following code and compile it to <B>a.out</B>:
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
 
void main(int argc, char *argv[])  
{    
    int x; 
 
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,argc);    
    for (x=0; x&lt;argc; x++)      
        printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,argv[x]);  
} 
</PRE>

<P>
In this code, the main program accepts two parameters, argv and
argc. The argv parameter is an array of pointers to string that
contains the parameters entered when the program was invoked at
the UNIX command line. The argc integer contains a count of the
number of parameters. This particular piece of code types out
the command line parameters. To try this, compile the code to
<B>a.out</B> and type <B>a.out xxx yyy zzz</B>. The code will
print the parameters, one per line.
<P>
The <B>char *argv[]</B> line is an array of pointers to string.
In other words, each element of the array is a pointer, and each
pointer points to a string (technically, to the first character
of the string). Thus, <B>argv[0]</B> points to a string that contains
the first parameter on the command line (the program's name),
<B>argv[1]</B> points to the next parameter, and so on. The argc
variable tells you how many of the pointers in the array are valid.
You will find that the preceding code does nothing more than print

<h1>UCant Dance - Events</h1>

<h2>1996</h2>

<dt><b>Orientation Party (Thursday 22 February)</b></dt>

<dd>Not bad for a Thursday night! We managed to pack the Upper Common Room
with keen dancers and those that drifted up from the main event in the
Ballroom to escape the bone crushing noise. 
<br></dd>

<dt><b><a href="http://www.mech.canterbury.ac.nz/clubs/latindnc/hanmer.htm">Hanmer
Weekend Trip</a> (11-12 May)</b></dt>

<dd>Twenty latin dancers descended on Hanmer Springs for the weekend in
May. The nice people at the Hanmer Springs Forest Camp Trust let us hold
a very noisy dance party in their dining hall. A couple of dips in the
hot springs and a BBQ plus some outdoorsy type running around kept us all
occupied. 
<br></dd>

<dt><b>Term 3 End of Term Party (Thursday, August 15)</b></dt>

<dd>As part of the end-of-term stein we kept the Lower Common Room rocking
while the Puffins played upstairs. Our mix of dance and latin music went
down quite well with a crowd who weren't familiar with Merengue and thought
Salsa is a sauce. 
<br></dd>

<dt><b>Latin Love Boat Break Up Party (Saturday, November 9)</b></dt>

<dd>With the aid of a fishing net, a rubber life raft, and oodles of cardboard
fish, the break up party was an event to remember. Dug into the coffers
and rented some heavy duty party gear including a strobe light and 400W
Jands amp. More grunt than a copulating pig! Now there's a pleasant image.
An impromptu Tango lesson and Pinata made for interesting distractions.
</dd>

<h2>1997</h2>

<dt><b>Orientation Party &quot;The UCant Dance Party&quot;</b></dt>

<dd>Hoping for another ripper this year. Thursday, 6 March, 8.30pm in the
Lower Common Room. The main event in the Ballroom will be the 3Ds and there
will be a fashion show in the Upper Common Room. Entry to the &quot;UCant
Dance Party&quot; will be by single night ticket or orientation ticket.
Orientation events are open to students and partners only.</dd>

<p><i>THESIS TITLE:</i> An Optimisation of Combustion Systems for Stirling
Engine Cogeneration Systems. </p>

<p><i>SUPERVISOR:</i> <a href="http://www.mech.canterbury.ac.nz/staff/academic/jkr.htm">Dr.
J.K. Raine</a> </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p>

<p>Stirling Cycle engines have been operating since the beginning of last
century, initially as an alternative to steam engines. It wasnt until
the late 1930s that the problems associated with the early engines and
the complex thermodynamics of this cycle started to be solved. This led
to a wide range of possible applications for the cycle including cryogenic
coolers, heat pumps, prime movers, and generators. The characteristics
of the cycle also suit it ideally for cogeneration applications. </p>

<p>The Stirling cycle uses external combustion therefore it is possible
to run the engine on a wide range of fuels and have a high degree of control
over the combustion processes. Similarly all the heat removed from the
engine is done externally. This is in contrast to an internal combustion
engine in which two thirds of the heat removed from the engine goes out
the exhaust. These two properties of the Stirling cycle make it a prime
candidate for cogeneration systems. For example the water circulating through
the cold end of a Stirling engine is essentially the same as a wet back
for a log fire which heats water for the hot water cylinder. Constant combustion
used in the Stirling cycle also enables high control of the heat source
ideally suited for Recuperation and Exhaust heat recovery. </p>

<p>Over the past five years the Mechanical Engineering department has been
engaged in the research of Stirling engine generators. Work done by Dr
Don Clucas lead to a prototype Stirling engine for charging 12 Volt batteries
on yachts. The previous research has concentrated on the design of the
internal workings of the Stirling cycle. This did not include detailed
design of the heat input devices to the engine and the utilisation of heat
removed from the cycle. </p>

<p>The aim of this project is to investigate and analyse the external inputs
and outputs of a Stirling engine generator system. Provision of heat to
the hot end heat exchangers and coolant to the cold end heat exchangers
are the external inputs to the cycle. The external outputs include the
use of exhaust gases for heating, the increase in coolant temperature and
the electrical output. As a result of this analysis an optimisation of
the variables will be undertaken to give an overall system that has minimum
fuel input to achieve the required electrical power output and maximum
waste heat utilisation. This will be applied to a scaled up version of
the prototype engine DM5 developed by Dr D. Clucas as part of his PhD and
it will have an electrical power output of approximately 3kW. This size
of engine fits the required output power for use as a remote area power
supply (RAPS) or for use in a domestic cogeneration application. </p>

<p><b>1. PROPOSED WORK</b></p>

<p><b>1.1 Literature Research</b></p>

<p>A comprehensive search of relevant literature has been and will continue
to be undertaken during the course of the project to ascertain the present
technology in the area of Stirling engine research. This field is large
and covers a wide range of disciplines with a large amount of literature
available, however there is only a small amount of information available
within this field on external systems for Stirling engines so it is necessary
to look at in the wider areas of burner design, combustion, recuperation
and cogeneration. After an initial search into current publications very
few publications were found on the application of overall combustion systems
for Stirling cycle engines. </p>

<p><b>1.2 3kW Engine Design</b></p>

<p>To conduct the research on the combustion system it is necessary to
have a test engine that is designed to incorporate the required control
and data acquisition equipment. As mentioned above a test engine with a
3kW electrical power output will be designed based on the research of Dr
D. Clucas. This size of engine was chosen as a result of studies into the
requirements for electricity generation within the domestic sector and
the possibility of more accurate measurements than the low power 200W engine
developed by Dr Clucas. This size of engine is also much more commercially
viable with a larger market potential. </p>

<p><b>1.3 Burner Configurations</b></p>

<p>LPG has been chosen as the fuel source for the heater to simplify the
analysis Future work could look into the application of different fuels
into the system design. This leaves four major variables to produce an
efficiency heat source for the Stirling engine: </p>

<ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>Burner type (Primary and/or secondary air combustion) </li>

<li>Blower, the need for forced aspiration for combustion. </li>

<li>Recuperation, using exhaust gases to preheat the incoming combustion
air. </li>

<li>Recovery of exhaust heat, for example using the exhaust gases to heat
water. </li>
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Initially several possible configurations for the burner will be decided
upon and prototypes built for testing. The best prototype burner will be
refined and optimised using a computer based finite element analysis. The
design of the burner and the fins on the heat exchanges of the Stirling
engine are closely associated so the test engine must facilitate a variety
of heat exchanger designs. </p>

<p><b>1.4 Computer Modelling</b></p>

<p>Once the burner configuration has been decided upon a model of the entire
system will be developed, including the recuperation and hot water heating
variables. There are two possible applications for the computer model within
the scope of this project: </p>

<ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>Emphasise the experimental side by testing the system under varying
conditions and using a simplified analytical model to back up the test
results. </li>

<li>Emphasise the computational side by developing an extensive computational
model going into the intricate workings of the Stirling cycle to produce
an optimal system solution. The results would then be confirmed on the
test engine. </li>
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The second option requires the use of high level computer software to
calculate the instantaneous conditions within the Stirling cycle. At present
we have a program, the Urieli &amp; Berchowitz model, which is becoming
obsolete and been questioned in its accuracy. It would be highly preferable
to obtain a modern computer program such as GLIMPS or one of its derivative
to do this work for us but these programs are costly. </p>

<p><b>1.5 Optimisation</b></p>

<p>Using the computer model and experimental test rig the Stirling engine
generator system will be optimised. The main variable in efficient burner
design is the amount of air supplied to the combustion. As a result of
this the initial investigation will be concerned with the result of going
from a naturally aspirated air supply through to forced convection. This
will be coupled with different levels of recuperation, exhaust heat recovery
and power control. Other areas of interest during the optimisation of the
system are: </p>

<ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>Effects of Uneven heating of the cylinder heads of a double acting
configuration </li>

<li>Heat transients in the hot end heat exchangers when changing power
levels. </li>

<li>What is and how does the thermal inertia of the burner and the engine
affect the operation? How can this be minimised or used to best advantage?
</li>

<li>Control of burner through changes in stroke, fuel flow and blower output.
</li>

<li>Emissions Control, are there certain standards to comply with and how
will this effect the burners performance? </li>
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>As a result of the optimisation it should be possible to define a complete
system for electricity generation and heat utilisation based on a LPG fuelled
Stirling engine. If the system is to be commercially viable it is necessary
for the system to be self regulating, adjusting inputs and outputs depending
on the system requirements at the time, and easy to operate and maintain.
</p>

<p><b>2. PROJECT RESOURCES</b> </p>

<p>The Stirling engine group of the Mechanical engineering department is
working in conjuction with WhisperTech Ltd. WhisperTech will cover material
costs for the building of a test engine. The majority of manufacturing
for the test engine can be performed within the department. The department
has provided required laboratory space and the majority of the computing
resources required to do the modelling and experimental work.. Most of
the computational modelling will be done on a PC based system while some
finite element work may require a more powerful UNIX or VAX system. It
would be desirable to purchase a modern Stirling cycle computer model such
as the GLIMPS package as mentioned previously. </p>

<H4>Calibration of Parallel Topology Robots</H4>

<P>At present, most robots in industrial applications are serial type robots.
These are characterised by a serial joint-link-joint structure and only
one open kinematic chain. Parallel robots are an entirely different class
of mechanism that uses multiple kinematic chains in parallel. As a result
a characteristic of parallel robots is the closed kinematic loops and the
use of passive (non-actuated joints). <BR>
Click on these illustrations of serial and parallel robot topologies to
see them better (142k). <BR>

<BR>
The advantage of parallel robots is the inherent stiffness of the mechanism
and the fact that one can situate the actuators on an immobile base member
(as with the DELTA robot) thereby reducing the mobile mass. A well known
parallel mechanism is the Stewart platform. <BR>
Calibration of robots is necessary if positioning accuracy is an important
consideration in a movement sequence. Most serial robots are only accurate
to the order of millimetres. Calibration can often improve position and
orientation accuracy by an order of magnitude. Similar improvement is expected
with parallel mechanisms.</P>

<H4>Hobbies and Interests</H4>

<P>As you may have gathered, I spend a lot of time dancing. I have been
a Ballroom dancer since 1989. So far I have sat examinations up to Second
Bar Gold Cross. I have 2 dance partners: Natalie and Justine, both are
top quality women. I've been into Latin Dance for about 4 years. In 1994,
a small group of people (including myself) got together and formed the
<A HREF="http://www.mech.canterbury.ac.nz/clubs/latindnc/latindnc.htm">Latin
Dance Club</A> in order to provide a cheap and friendly place to learn
the dances (Salsa, Cumbia and Merengue). The next year I assumed the President's
post after the first president found a job and left. It's been both a fantastic
experience and a nightmare since I took up the job: lots of work and lots
of things to keep organised and running smoothly. <BR>
I've also done a small bit of Flamenco (a bit hard on the ankles) and,
recently, a bit of CeRock dancing (not so good at that).</P>

<P>Then there's guitar making, which I used to do a lot, but now I have
trouble finding the time for. I make electric guitars (acoustic guitars
are really difficult to make and I haven't got the tools). I've made a
couple of &quot;bitsa&quot; guitars, a Telecaster copy, and a Gibson Les
Paul copy. The GLP sounds pretty good. I used the Gibson L6-S circuitry
because it gives lots of tonal variation. The body and neck are made of
mahogany and I designed and made the bridge out of brass. As a result (and
because I use heavier gauge strings) the sustain is amazing. The guitar
also weighs a ton. The nut is bone because it gives a more mellow sound
than brass, which can sometimes sound twangy. I also have an electric bass
sitting around half finished. <BR>
I play these instruments through a tiny 30W amp that I built as well. It's
amazing how creative you can get if you are too cheap to buy anything.</P>

<P>Last year my friend Hamish and I entered in the annual cardboard boat
race on lake Victoria. Now that was a ball. We were pretty disappointed
that the contestants were allowed to paint their boats in order to seal
them. We had gone to the trouble to design a boat that would float despite
being waterlogged. As a result the boat was quite slow. It floated long
enough to get us across the lake and we reckon it would have taken us quite
a long way further before finally sinking. It was vitally important that
it didn't sink because I couldn't swim at that stage.</P>

<P>A couple of months ago I got sick of not being able to swim so I took
some lessons. It was awesome. The sense of achievement was enormous. I
never learned to swim as a child because I guess I was afraid of the water.
Nowadays I practice swimming at least once a week. <BR>
I've also taken up juggling recently. I spend a lot of time bending over
picking up the balls at the moment. It gets just a bit easier every time.</P>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<DD>The design of mechanical hands has been investigated at many universities.
Most of the hands produced by their research have large actuator packs
which are usually heavy and located remotely from the hand. They are also
complex to control. A number of robotic hand designs are reviewed and their
shortcomings are discussed briefly. A feasibility study in 1993 at the
University of Canterbury on a mechanically linked finger was used as the
starting point for the design of a new finger  the Canterbury finger.
Several combinations of electric drive motors, gearboxes, lead screws and
mechanical linkages were examined before the final configuration was selected.
The result is a human sized finger and hand capable of exerting a reasonable
force at the finger tip, and able to curl through 180&deg; in two distinct
motions. While the dexterity typical of tendon operated fingers is retained,
the new design avoids the elasticity and friction problems of tendon operated
hands. A single mechanically linked two degree-of-freedom (DOF) finger
was designed, built and tested. The design and performance criteria were
met, and the working finger provided insight into areas for improvement
and future development. This thesis includes manufacturing drawings, test
results, and basic control software for the Canterbury finger. </DD>

<h1><b>ROBOTICS AND CONTROL<br><p></b></h1>

<IMG SRC="robot.JPG"><br>

The above robot is being developed for driving an antenna dish. This particular
robot is known as a parallel robot since there are multiple connections between the
moveable platform at the top and the base. Parallel robots are becoming
increasingly popular as they offer advantages over traditional serial robots, such as
higher lifting forces and greater stiffness. This is one of several parallel robots
being designed and investigated by the Department of Mechanical Engineering.<br><p>

Students also have the opportunity of learning computer and micro-processor
control, pneumatics and hydraulics. Mechanical and electrical stability of systems
are also studied.<br><p>

<h2>Other WWW sources:</h2>
<p>
The following list of WWW sources are just provided for general interest. It does in no
way reflect whether the information therein is endorsed by Greenpeace or
not. It is not meant to be exhaustive; some of the sites below provide
 more elaborate listings.<br>
For instance, have a look at:

<ul>
<li>the <A HREF="http://www.webdirectory.com/">Amazing Environmental 
Organization WebDirectory</A>, with a 
<a href="http://www.webdirectory.com/survey_results.html">survey</a> where 
Greenpeace was voted the most popular environmental organisation.
</li>
<li>the directory in <a

<li><A HREF="www.ulb.ac.be/ceese/cds.html">Directory of Best Environmental

It is taking too much of my time to maintain the list below, so there is quite a 
backlog. Many links may be outdated by now. Use them at your own peril!<br>

<H2>About the new Greenpeace Web Navigator</H2></CENTER>
<hr>
<B>The gif below (clicking on it won't do anything) shows how the new navigator works:</B><BR><BR>

<img src="pics/navigate.gif" width=662 height=289>
<P><H3>Principles:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Every icon should be 'clickable'.
<LI>Every icon should be replaced by explanatory text when your web browser is in text only mode or when accessing using a text browser.
<LI>There should always be a box around one icon, which should indicate what area of the web server you are in.
<LI>The navigator bar makes extensive use of tables as implemented in HTML3.  Although most browsers will give some kind of support for tables, and we endeavour to be compatible with all browsers, the navigator bar works best in Netscape 1.1 (or higher). 


 If your view of the navigator bar differs greatly from the image above then you could consider installing Netscape.
<LI> General web tools such as search and gopher should be found in the information section.

<p>  The nuclear waste shipment was prepared at the La Hague
         plutonium "reprocessing" factory near Cherbourg (France). 
<p>  The transport involving two casks holding 40 glass blocks of extremely radioactive
         nuclear waste containing some 20,500,000 curies of radioactivity, left Cherbourg on Monday 13th January. 
<p>This glassified nuclear waste is so deadly that a person within one metre of a single unshielded
         glass block would receive a fatal dose of radiation in less than one
         minute.

<hr>

<p> Greenpeace obtained a confidential document in December, which stated the second
            controversial plutonium waste shipment from Europe to Japan would leave
            France for Japan on 16th January 1997, on board the UK registered ship
            Pacific Teal. 
<p> The route for the ship is given as South Africa - east of
            Australia -south Pacific and finally Japan. 
<p>The document, which  authenticity has not been confirmed yet, also states that en-route
            governments are to be informed on 23rd December of the intended route of
            the waste.

<BR>As part of a wider campaign against dumping, Greenpeace has maintained from the start that it is wrong in principle to dump oil 
installations at sea.
<P>To dump structures, such as the Brent Spar, in areas of high marine biodiversity 
     with poorly understood ecology infringes the precautionary 
     principle and presents unknown environmental risks.  To do so would set 
     dangerous precedents for future dumping of wastes at sea.  
     It ignores the impact of many similar decisions which would be taken 
     in isolation without consideration of their cumulative effect.  It 
     amounts to a reversal of promises made when development of North Sea 
     oil began. 
<P>The availability of the `quick and dirty' dumping option 
     reduces the incentive to pursue innovative decommissioning and 
     recycling options.  Further, it flies in the face of growing 
     international political and public consensus not to use the sea as a 
     dump for wastes.  
<P>The map left follows the course of the new Greenpeace ship M.V. Arctic Sunrise on its fact finding tour of North Sea Oil installations.

What is the role of science in environmental policy? Is science alone enough to assess environmental risk? How should decisions be made when environmental impacts are often so uncertain?



<P>Greenpeace advocates a precautionary approach to environmental protection. Such an approach requires the use of clean production techniques, innovative solutions and social and consumer change to achieve an ultimate goal of zero discharges of harmful substances to the environment.



<P>Sometimes this approach is called "unscientific", by those who argue that industry should continue to produce whatever it wishes unless there is absolute proof that a given substance is causing environmental harm. Greenpeace argues that this is impossible and dangerous - it has already led to a damaged ozone layer, the growing threat of climate change and the build up of persistent chemicals such as PCBs in marine wildlife.



<P>You can now explore these three general themes further or jump to our Hormone Disrupting Chemicals site where we focus upon a specific issue in detail. If you want to comment on any of the articles or evidence you see here, publicise a relevant conference or other event, or express your opinion on any of the issues raised in these pages, you can do so in our <a href="hdc/index.html#debate"> debate zone.</a> </td></tr></table>

<P>Science can inform decisions, but it does not make them. How should we make political or business decisions faced with scientific uncertainty? The Precautionary Principle addresses the link between science and policy. It requires that preventative action is taken against harmful releases into the environment. 



<P>In Article 2 of the OSPAR Convention, the signatories - including the UK - agreed 

that:



<P>2. The Contracting Parties shall apply:



<P>a) the precautionary principle, by virtue of which preventative measures are taken 

when there are reasonable grounds for concern that substances or energy introduced, 

directly or indirectly, into the marine environment may bring about hazards to human 

health, harm living resources and marine ecosystems, damage amenities or interfere 

with other legitimate uses of the sea, even when there is no conclusive evidence of a 

causal relationship between the inputs and effects;



<P>b) the polluter pays principle, by virtue of which the costs of pollution prevention, 

control and reduction measures are to be borne by the polluter

<P>Research priorities are influenced by political decisions and regulations. Political decisions, particularly on environmental matters, are then informed by that research. This process tends to exclude issues and views that lie outside the regulatory framework. 



<P>There are dangers when politicians or industrialists maintain that decisions are purely scientific, especially when they have determined the research priorities in the first place. What is the relationship between science, policy and public concern about the environment? Should scientists take more responsibility for how their research is framed and used?

<P>On 16 February last year, Greenpeace learned that the UK government had granted permission for Shell Oil to dump a huge, heavily contaminated oil installation, the 4,000 tonne Brent Spar, into the North Atlantic despite it being loaded with toxic and radioactive sludge.  Dumping operations, just west of

Ireland and Scotland, were expected to begin in May.  Greenpeace went into action with plans to take over and occupy the rig to

prevent the dumping.  More than two dozen activists from six North Sea countries pulled operations together. 

Video and photo staff were called upon to document the Brent Spar platform and the occupation.  The Moby Dick delivered activists to the platform and remained in the area to provide back up. Following eviction by Shell, Greenpeace activists re-occupied the Brent Spar and continued to protest Shells plans.



<P>Ironically, the planned Shell dump came just one month before North Sea environment ministers were due to meet in Denmark in June to

discuss measures to eliminate the discharge of hazardous substances from all sources into the North Sea and the marine

environment.
Greenpeace believes that if this platform were to be dumped at sea, with some 400 others at work in the North Sea alone, this would

have set a dangerous precedent. At the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPARCOM) meeting, 11 out of 13 countries agreed a moratorium on the 
dumping of offshore installations, pending agreement on a outright ban.

WHAT YOU CAN DO
 
<I><p>As you will see from the Greenpeace International Nuclear pages,
we are campaigning to stop reprocessing, to start the global
phase-out of nuclear power and to bring about nuclear
disarmament.
 
<p>But we need your help.  In this section we will let you know
about demonstrations and activities that you can join, advise you
on letters and faxes that we would like you to send and generally
ask for your help in the global campaign for a nuclear-free
future.</I>

<FONT SIZE=+0 FACE="MS SERIF"><p>The "Atoms for Peace" dream turned out to be a failure. None of its promises have 
been realised. In spite of the massive financial and scientific investments and 
prioritisation above all other energy sources, nuclear power did not solve the energy 
problem. It did not provide the world with an abundant supply of electricity that is  
"too cheap to meter". Ten years after the Chernobyl accident, it has become even 
clearer that nuclear power is an ultimate problem, rather than the ultimate solution...

<P>Since the very beginning of its existance, Greenpeace campaigned to unveil the 
"Atoms for Peace" myth.  Now Greenpeace is helping to contribute to the realisation 
of a realistic, safe and sustainable alternative that will fulfil all the promises which the 
"Atoms for Peace" deal could not.  This "New Energy Deal" is the only way out of the 
dead end street of the nuclear era...

<p>Russia is currently involved in extensive discussions on the future 
energy strategy for the country. The decline in industry over the 
past 7 years has created a decrease in electricity consumption of 
about 20%. This means that there is now a unique chance to get rid 
of dangerous nuclear power plants, replacing them with energy 
efficiency and renewable energy technology...

<p>The shipment involving two casks holding 40 glass blocks of extremely radioactive
         nuclear waste containing some 20,500,000 curies of radioactivity, left Cherbourg on Monday 13th January. 


<p><b>Wednesday January 15th:</b><br>
 New Zealand's Foreign Minister, Don McKinnon has released
another statement on the transport in which he says that New
Zealand is "Extremely disappointed" that the shipment will pass
through the South-west Pacific despite his country's making it
clear that they did not want "it to come anywhere near us."  He
also states that "The Japanese Government can be under no illusion
that it will do so [make the transport] aganst the wishes of the
people of the South Pacific."  He reiterated the demand that the
transport remain outside of NZ's EEZ.
 
<p> A decision was taken by the Malaysian government to ban the
transport and demand that it remain outside of its 200 mile EEZ. 
The decision was taken during a meeting of the Cabinet of the
Malaysian government during its weekly meeting and was announced by
the Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding. 
As an interesting aside, Law apparently stated that as a party to
the NPT and under its Atomic Energy Licensing Act, Malaysia had the
legal right to control the movement of nuclear material within its
national jurisdiction.
 
<p> Despite direct questions from journalists,
COGEMA will not say what it means that the shipment will go via the
"South-west Pacific".  Even with more careful journalists, this is
leading to comments about the "secret" route.

     <p>Are we about to witness the beginning of the end of nuclear power in 
     Russia?
     <p>On December 8th, the people of Kostroma  cast their votes in the first ever regional referendum on nuclear power in Russia.  
     <p>When communities in western Europe have been asked about nuclear 
     power, many have said no to new reactors. National referenda have 
     stopped nuclear power programmes in Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and 
     Italy.  While in Asia, Japanese and Taiwanese residents have also 
     voted overwhelming against new reactors in regional referenda.
     Finally a Russian community has been given the opportunity to say no

The issues can be involved and confusing, - so much is unknown and untested, but as recent news articles testify, and as genetically engineered products appear on supermarket shelves there is widespread and increasing concern about the use of this technology 
and the effect it may have on the natural order. Greenpeace is in the forefront of challenging the fast growing and powerful genetic engineering industry and the threat it poses to the earth's biodiversity...

<P><img align=left border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> This fall, U.S. farmers will harvest the first crop of genetically engineered
soybeans. The soybeans have been genetically altered by chemical giant Monsanto
and contain gene sequences from bacteria and viruses.  Monsanto's Roundup Ready
Soybeans (RRS) represent a crucial step in a massive genetic experiment in
which humans beings and the environment are the guinea pigs.  Although this
year less than 2% of US soybeans will be Roundup Ready, the plan is to mix them
with traditional soybeans and introduce them into many of the hundreds of
products which contain soybeans.

<img align=left border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> Under Monsanto's plan consumers would NOT have the right to choose whether or

<P><img align=left border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> There is only one benefit of RRS: is can survive exposure to glyphosate (trade
name "Roundup"). Against this single benefit weigh the risks of genetic
"pollution," allergies, and rising
dependence on herbicides. Genetic engineering is a vast experiment with unknown
risks.

<I>
<P><img align=left border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> 60% of processed consumer food products contain soybean material -
from margarine to baby food and chocolate bars.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> The U.S. produces most of the world's soybeans and exports about half
its crop to Europe and Asia.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> Roundup Ready Soybeans bring no benefit whatsoever to the consumer --
they are not cheaper, tastier or healthier. 
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif">  A poll shows over 80 per cent of consumers in Germany are opposed to
genetically engineered food. Germany purchases 1 272 300 Metric Tons of U.S.
soybeans per year.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif">  Roundup Ready Soybeans will increase farmer's dependency and use of
Monsanto's chemical herbicide Roundup.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif">  15 per cent of Monsanto's total sales is accounted for by Roundup, and
it is the world's best selling herbicide
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif"> There is significant evidence that Roundup can cause harm to the
environment and human health even at current levels of use.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif">   Other genetically engineered foods have caused unpredicted allergies,
illnesses and even death.
<P><img border=0 width=14 height=15 src="../icons/gexi02.gif">  Genetically engineered organisms have been known to cross-breed with
wild plants causing unpredictable and irreversible changes to natural
ecosystems.

<font size=+1>Worldwide, 76% of the planet's 
original  primary forests have already been destroyed or 
degraded:

<P><a href="../pics/for27.gif">
<img  vspace=7 hspace=12 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for27t.gif" src="../pics/for27s.gif" width=115 height=175 border=0></a>

<P>Still the onslaught continues, primarily through  
destructive logging for wood and paper production by irresponsible transnational corporations. 
Tropical rainforests alone are being reduced at a rate equivalent to an area the 
size of the Netherlands and Switzerland each year.
 
<P><B>The effects are devastating. Anywhere between 4,000 and 6,000 
unique  types of forest-dependent plant, animal and insect 
species are becoming extinct annually. </B> Meanwhile, the 
livelihoods and cultures of numerous indigenous forest-
dwelling peoples and the economies of many forest-dependent 
communities are also in danger of completely  disappearing.

<P>Greenpeace has developed <B><a href="forp&g.html">guidelines for 
environmentally and socially responsible forest use</a></B> and are 
extensively campaigning for their adoption by  governments, 
industry and international regulatory organisations.  

<P>Greenpeace is advocating a ban on the further development of  
monoculture plantations, on clearcutting and predatory 
logging, and on the use of chemical pesticides and 
fertilisers. At the same time, the organisation is urging a 
reduction in the manufacture of wood and paper products and 
promoting the use of non-tree fibres and products  which are 
known to be environmentally and socially responsible. As  part 
of this process, we are supporting the struggles of indigenous  
peoples in securing land rights and the protection of their 
forests  from destructive activities. </font> </td>

humans have thought of the oceans as infinitely resilient and able to
withstand just about anything we can take from them or put into them.  Not so. 
We can now see the telling effects of human activities such as overfishing,
chemical pollution, destruction of coastal habitats and global climate change
 all taking their toll on the diversity and abundance of life in the oceans.

<P>Greenpeace has had a longstanding bond with the oceans.  We began in 1971 on
the ocean when a handful of people set sail for a nuclear test site off Alaska
in an old boat.  Since then, Greenpeace has built up a fleet of oceangoing
ships carrying their signature rainbow to all corners of the world to bear
witness to and prevent environmental abuses.

<br>Subject: Update at 0000 GMT 20/3 - Day 25.

<P><H4>CHILEAN NAVY FORBIDS PINTAIL TO ENTER 200 MILE EEZ;
PINTAIL HEADS THAT WAY ANYWAY
</H4></head><body>
    <P>The position of the Pacific Pintail at 2300 GMT was 55
degrees and 58 minutes south and 65 degrees and 11 minutes west,
on a distance of some 20 miles east of the Chilean Exclusive
Economic Zone. We are sailing at a course of 240 degrees at a
speed of 4 knots.  We could thus reach the Chilean EEZ in
approximately 5 hours, ie. Monday morning at 0400 GMT.

     <P>Today the Chilean Navy issued a statement to the Pacific
Pintail in a radio communication, transcribed below (1).

    <P>Later today at 2242 GMT, the Chilean Navy informed
Greenpeace that they had sent the following telex message to the
Pacific Pintail by Chile's General Director for the Maritime
Territory and Merchant Marine. The text is also below (2).

     <P>The Chilean Government has taken a very strong position on
the looming passage of the Pintail into its waters. Chile's
Government has banned the shipment from all its territorial and
jurisdictional waters and has entrusted the Navy with its
enforcement.  For more information please contact Juan Carlos
Cardenas at Greenpeace Chile (++56-2-737 8140) or Damon Moglen
(++54-9-012-4550).

     <P>The weather around Cape Horn continues to worsen with waves
of 10 meters coming over the Solo's side and winds gusting off
the bow.  It's much as it was when we left France with the crew
having to strap down everything on board, including themselves
come bed time.  Cape Horn is renowned for its bad weather, drift
ice and heave seas.  The further south we and the Pintail go, the
worse the weather will be.  The captain of the Pintail is
knowingly acting irresponsibly by sailing this far south. The
Pintail may cross into the Antarctica Treat Area below 60 degrees
south, in flagrant denial of international agrement to preserve
the pristine continent from environmental threats.  

     <P>For additional information on the Pacific Pintail's voyage
or it's cargo of plutonium waste is required, please contact Bas
Bruyne on the Solo (phone: ++871-1301166--warning $10 per
minute), or Karen Richardson at Greenpeace UK (phone:
++44-171-226-3151). Photo, video or other media requests to Blair
Palese or Mark Warford at Greenpeace Communications (phone:
++44-171-833-0600). 
 
     <P>Media and others interested in tracking the shipment's route
daily should access Greenpeace World Wide Web site at:

1995 1830GMT-
<P>CN = Chilean Navy patrol
     <br>PP = Pacific Pintail
<br>(CN calls Pacific Pintail) 
<br>CN:   Pacific Pintail, this is Chilean Navy Patrol, over
I presume that I'm speaking with the Captain, over
<br>PP:   You are speaking to the captain, sir, good afternoon;
<br>CN:   Good afternoon sir, this is Chilean Navy Patrol; I would
like to notify you that for resolution of the Chilean Navy, the
Chilean Government to the Chilean Navy, you are not allowed to
sail into our Exclusive Economic Zone, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, this is Pacific Pintail, I have statement to read
you as follows:  My passage plan does not transit the territorial
seas of Chile. As my vessel is engaged in lawful trade no foreign
state has a lawful right to interfere with my navigation on the
high seas I repeat I do not intend to pass through your country's
territorial seas. If you wish any further information please
state the nature of your inquiry and I will provide you with any
relevant information that I am able to, otherwise I will seek my
owners instructions and revert. If necessary my owners will refer
the matter to the British Government, over;
<br>CN:   I understood you do not go to sail through our sea
territory. But the resolution of the Chilean Government is that
you are not allowed to sail through our Exclusive Economic Zone. 
The resolution of the Chilean Government, Chilean Navy is number
12600.67 of 16 March 1995, over;
<br>PP:   Yes, but I repeat we are not passing through your
territorial seas we are on the high seas over;
<br>CN:   Yes roger I understood....thank you very much, have a good
trip
<br>PP:   OK we are monitoring Channel 16, Good Afternoon Sir
--- BREAK OF 5 MINUTES--
<br>CN: (Calls Pacific Pintail on Channel 16)
<br>PP:  Chilean Navy Patrol, this is Pacific Pintail
<br>CN:  Channel 12
<br>PP:  Chancel 12
<br>CN:  Pacific Pintail this Chilean Navy Patrol, over
<br>PP:  This is the Pacific Pintail, go ahead please;
<br>CN:  I would like to notify you that if you keep this course and
speed you're going to go inside of our sea territory, over; 
<br>PP:  Yes sir, I would like to repeat that I do not intend to pass
through your country's territorial seas....
<br>CN:  Understood...unintelligible).. that you are going to change
your course later, over;
<br>PP:  ...otherwise I will have to seek my owners instructions and
revert. If necessary it will have to be referred to the British
Government,  over;
<br>CN:  Sir, I understood, but the thing is if you keep this course
you are going to go inside of our territory the question is if
you are going to change your course, your heading, over;
<br>PP:   My present course will keep me out side your territorial
waters, we will pass 15 miles inside Diego Ramirez and 15 miles
from the land-mass, the coast line therefore we are outside
territorial waters and we are carrying out a lawful trade, over;
<br>CN:   Sir, I understood, but one thing is that you are not
allowed to sail through our Exclusive Economic Zone, do you
understand?
<br>PP:    Yes sir, I understand but your economic zone as you know
every ship has the right of free passage and we are engaged in
freedom,free trade free trade and a legal trade and therefore we
are allowed free passage through an Economic Zone, over;
<br>CN:  Roger, but the Chilean Government have a resolution about
that you can not sail through our Economic Zone, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, well this maybe the case but these are my
instructions and I will have to refer the matter to my owners,
and possibly then to the British Government this is a very safe
ship as you know we have very bad weather and we are being very
careful with our passage safe navigation, and we feel that you
have no problem for your safety side of it, otherwise I will have
to revert with further information, over
<br>CN:   Yes, I understood, very clear, listen, but our resolution
from the Chilean Government said that you must stay 200 miles far
away from Diego Ramirez, do you understand?
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I would like to repeat that we
will not transit your territorial seas we will not be within 12
miles of your coast line, and therefore we have freedom of
passage on the high seas, over;
<br>CN:    Yes, I would like to explain that our Economic Zone is not
high sea, is not high sea, it is our Economic Zone, and you are
not allowed to sail through this zone, over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I would like to dispute that, the
territorial waters are 12 miles from your coast line and on
either Diego Ramirez or the main land therefore anything outside
that which will be, will be high seas, the EEZ has nothing to do
with high seas. Any vessel on the high seas according to the
various conventions of the Safety at Seas, and the agreements of
the Law of the Sea allows us freedom of passage, over;
<br>CN:   Ok, that is very clear about that, only 12 mile is the
territory seas. But the Economic Zone is 200 miles and is not
high sea, is not high sea, is our Economic Zone and you are not
allowed ... you are not allowed to sail through our sea, over;
<br>PP:   Well at present we are in a very strong wind here, the wind
is gusting to 70 knots, that is 12 meters per second. I am not
in a position to alter course or argue. Can you tell me your
intentions, because my instructions are to carry on with a normal
route in the high seas which allows me freedom of passage,
freedom of passage, over;
<br>CN:   Yes, I would like you to change your intention. I would
like you to change your course to go outside of our 200 mile
economic zone, please;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, at the moment the wind is gusting
to maybe over 13 to 14 meters per second. We are in no position
to alter course for safety reasons. Sir, I will have to revert,
over;
<br>CN:   OK, I understood, (unintelligible).. time, your ship, it
will be tracked for this authority for this ship and plane will
like you to change your course and go outside our economic zone,
please;
<br>PP:   I am sorry the wind is blowing very strong here, and I had
a job hearing that, such is the noise. We are in a very, very
strong wind-squall, could you repeat that last message please,
over;
<br>CN:   The message is: That our plane and ship is to keep going
to tracking you from this moment from this time because you don't
want to change your course, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, that is quite acceptable, thank you, we are a safe
ship and we want to carry on a free trade, which is a legal
trade. We do not mind at all, we welcome you to escort us and we
would like freedom of passage, over;     
<br>CN:   OK, If you don't want to change your course. You are
intolerant to the international community. Cause we
(unintelligible) do is dissipation, over;
<br>PP:   Yes OK, I would like some information as to what you're
actions might be, over;

that you don't go away from our economic zone we are going report
this situation to the international community, because you don't
comply with our resolution, over;
<br>PP:   Yes sir, I receive that message and as such is the weather
at the moment which is as I say very bad, I can not alter course
at the moment, but I still insist that we are on the high seas
at all times, and we do not intend to pass through your country's
territorial seas. I will have to now inform my owners and they
will refer the matter to the British Government, over;
<br>CN:   Roger, Stand-by for one minute.
<HR>
CN:   Pacific Pintail, this is Chilean Navy Patrol, over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, go ahead sir,
<br>CN:  ..(unintelligible)..till this time we are going to tracking
your position every time because you don't want to change your
mind, you don't want to change the course. I hope, I hope you
change your course to don't go to sail into our economic zone,
over;
<br>PP:   This is Pacific Pintail, I am sorry you were a little bit
broken, again, could you repeat that, please, over;
<br>CN:   Ok I say again, Pacific Pintail, from this time we are
going to tracking your position every time because you don't want
to change your idea, and you don't want to change your course to
sail far away from our 200 miles. I hope that you change your
course, I hope that you change your course to don't go to sail
into our economic zone, over;
<br>PP:   Yes, Ok I think I receive that I will try to repeat it back
that I understand that because we do not want to alter our
position you will track our course. We are very happy to
cooperate in any way we can with that, over;
<br>CN:   I would like to cooperate with you, but the idea of
tracking you is decide that you don't go inside of our economic
zone. The idea is not cooperate with you, it is that you change
your course, over;
<br><H4>PP:   Ok, thank you Chilean Navy, you still insist that we pass
outside your 200 mile zone, over;
<br>CN:   Yes, please, I hope you change your course, over;

this.</H4>

<br>Subject: UPDATE


<H4>CHILEAN NAVY FORCES NUCLEAR WASTE SHIP TO MOVE SOUTH OUT OF ITS
WATERS</H4>

     <P>Around 1400 GMT today the Chilean Navy intercepted the
Pacific Pintail with its cargo of high level radioactive waste
bound for Japan and, after repeated radio exchange, forced the
Pintail to move south out of Chilean waters. 

     <P>The Chilean navy action comes after yesterday informing the
master of the Pacific Pintail that his ship would not be allowed
into the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone of Chile. The Pintail's
master did not acknowledge the Chilean prohibition and continued
to steer his ship into Chilean waters.  Early this morning the
Pacific Pintail entered the waters of Chile and continued on a
course straight west in her attempt to pass Cape Horn at a
distance of some 30 miles.

     <P>Enclosed is a transcript of radio traffic between Pacific
Pintail and Chilean Navy 20 March 1995, 1400 GMT:

<H4>PACIFIC PINTAIL SAILS SOUTH TOWARDS ANTARCTICA </H4>
  
    <P>At 1600 GMT today, the Pacific Pintail agreed to turn south
after the Chilean Navy threatened to use force if necessary to
guarantee it would not travel through Chilean waters.  Since then
the Pintail has been steaming in the general southern direction
on a course of 180 degrees and at a speed of 8 knots. The Pintail
is heading straight down from Cape Horn. The Pacific Pintail
therefore did not sail, yet, into the Southern Pacific Ocean. 

<P>The Pintail's position at 1830 GMT was 56 degrees and 35 minutes
South and 67 degrees and 22 minutes West. 
    
     <P>Enclosed with this update the Part 2 in the latest series
of transcripts between the Chilean Navy and the Pacific Pintail,
while the Pintail's radioactive waste saga continues.

<H6><p>July 8</H6>
 
<p>Sundown on Saturday afternoon on any other South Pacific cruise
and you might expect to be sipping gin and tonics on the poop
deck.  Not this one.  A couple of hours before, the Rainbow
Warrior has made a rendezvous with the yacht Vega, about 30 miles 
north of Moruroa.  Vega is something of a veteran of the campaign
against nuclear weapons testing here at Moruroa, having first
sailed here in 1972, and spent 45 days in the exclusion zone when
atmospheric tests were conudcted here by letting off nuclear
bombs suspended over the lagoon on large balloons.  This is
her fifth time to protest at Moruroa, having returned in 1973,
1981, 1982 and 1985.
 
<p>As the sun goes down the ship's crew continue to transfer food,
water, and fuel to Vega; the resupply takes until after dark. 
Two crew also change between the Warrior and the Vega.  As
darkness evelopes the boats, amongst the to-ing and fro-ing of
inflatables, the Warrior's inflatable number 3 slips into
darkness, complete with its crew of three and supplies and
equipment to last a sustained period at sea.  Three brave people
-- David McTaggart, Henk Haazen and Chris Robinson -- set off to
play an extended waiting game with the French naval forces
guarding Moruroa atoll.  We wish them the very best of luck on
their bold adventure.  Goodbyes to the Vega too as she slips away
after such a short visit: 45 days at sea from Panama and the
Warrior was her first stop!

<img align=top src="rw118t.gif" alt="Skipper clears bridge deck.">94KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw118.jpg">30KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan  

<p>With the crew and boats back on board, final preparations for the
next day's action begin.  All doors, ports and hatches are
secured, only the absolutely necessary ones remaining open in
case we are boarded or rammed during the action.  A final crew
meeting is held, and all hands except the watch head for bed.
<br> 
<H6><p>July 9</H6>
 
<p>0100 hours and all hands are roused from their bunks after what
feels like a brief sleep -- and it was!  Most were lucky to get
three hours.  A meeting in the mess and a prayer of blessing by
Mgr. Gaillot, the Catholic bishop from France, and Pastor
Temarama, a local priest from Moorea takes place.  Then the
action begins.
 
<p>Circling Moruroa at 15 miles, south-east of the pass, two
inflatables (boats 4 and 5) are speedily launched over the side
of the ship and into the darkness.  This was done by the light
of the moon, with no lights on deck: the setting moon, well
muffled by clouds provided enough light for us, but not enough
for the five French warships in the immediate vicinity to see
what was going on.  By 2.15am the Warrior was steaming north at
10 knots, leaving the two boats to play cat and mouse for a
couple of hours with a couple of French warships and their
inflatables.  Four a.m. and the second paif of boats (boats 1 and
3) go over the side of the Warrior.  This time it is pitch black:
the moon has set and the weather has turned squally.  But the
crew are well practiced, and the operation is again over in a
matter of minutes.  The Warrior continues to steam north.
 
<p>Out on the sea, there is a bit of a breeze, and the sea is a
pleasant metre or so high.  The boats stay close together but it
is hard for two reasons: first, more than twenty metres apart and
we lose sight of one another; and second, a French ship is
bearing down on us!  Driving this way and that in a pair, we
manage to elude two French ships and a helicopter with a
searchlight.  After forty minutes of this, and a couple of close
calls, the GPS satellite navigation device  one of the boats is
equipped with is checked and we find we are 18 miles from
Moruroa!  The arrangement is that the Warrior will cross the 12
mile line at five am and at that time so will the inflatables,
so there is no time to lose.  The glow of the Moruroa nuclear
base is visible on the horizon, so both boats turn toward the
light, wish each other good luck, and head full throttle into the
darkness.  It is impossible at speed, in this sea, to stay close
together -- without risking a collision -- so the boats make
their own course.

<P><a href="rw114.gif">
<img align=top src="rw114t.gif">91KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw114.jpg">31KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan  

<p>As we turn toward Moruroa and open the throttle wide, the crew
of boat 1 find that suddenly life gets a lot rougher!  We are now
heading east -- into the sea and wind.  Eighteen miles to go to
the pass, then another fourteen or so down the lagoon to the
drilling rig.  One advantage of the rough ride is that the French
soon lose the stomach for the chase, and the lights slowly
disappear astern.  With the first light of dawn just peaking
through clouds to the north east, the tall masts of the Warrior
are seen a couple of miles to the north, also heading flat stick
for the pass through the reef into the lagoon.  By the time we
reach the reef, it is quite light: the ride has been rough but
fairly uneventful: a French ship was passed about a mile to the
south, and a helicopter passed about half a mile away, but it was
all too dark to see the inflatable.  We have only slowed down
once, to change fuel lines to a fresh tank.

<P><a href="rw107.gif">
<img align=top src="rw107t.gif" alt="french commandoes storm aboard.">72KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw107.jpg">21KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan  

<p>At we reach the reef we see a French warship coming up from the
south at speed, heading for the atoll.  At first the inflatable
turns north, running laong the reef, but within a minute or two
we lose our bearings and realise that the warship is heading for
the pass -- to the south!  Turning around and staying very close
to the breakers on the reef to avoid detection by radar, the
inflatable runs south for a mile then swings in around the nose
of the reef, into the pass.  The warship is coming into the pass
only a quarter mile to the south.  Boat one just goes for it, and
in a couple of hundred metres we are in the lagoon!


<p>Reinvigorated by this successful breach of Moruroa's defences,
and also the calmer waters of the lagoon, the boat speeds off
with the throttle hard against the stops.  The towers of the test
centre are visible in the distance, some fourteen miles down the
lagoon.  The target is the drilling rig, and we don't know
exactly where it will be, but that end seems like a good place
to start.  Halfway down the lagoon a helicopter appears and for
ten minutes or so, buzzes the inflatable, repeatedly coming down
to about 10 metres in an attempt to turn the boat back.  But the
boat is far more maneouvrable than the helicopter, and the crew
take time to give the pilot a few cheeky waves in between
assaults.  Eventualy the pilot decides he is wasting his time and
disappears to try another inflatable coming behind us some way.
 
<p>By now the port at Moruroa is close, and it is time to prepare
for boarding the drilling rig.  This is used to drill the
boreholes in the lagoon floor down which the nuclear bombs are
put to be exploded. The more we can do to disrupt preparations
for testing, the better.  With the rig coming up fast, the lock
box is unlashed from the boat.  Kate, who is not driving, then
fixes the locking devices to my wrists, and I sling the lockbox
over my shoulder on its line -- all while the boat is going full
speed.  The rig is close now.  We scan it for a ladder or other
way to climb abaord, as the deck is ten feet from the water. 
Then we see that it is constructed on two huge pontoons, with a
recess between them rather like a huge catamaran.  Across that
recess, only five feet above the water, is a walkway.  We drive
straight at the walkway, and as Kate grab the steelwork,  I kill
the motor and climb aboard the rig.  Quick as a flash I spring
up the steps to the main deck.  A ladder is right in front.  I
go up the ladder and swing across onto a platform.  Slipping
through the handrail, with French Foreign Legionnaires already
running up the deck, I swing the lockbox off my back, loop my
right arm through the raling, and lock my hands into the lockbox. 
Time, just after 6am.  We have a lock-on!

<p>Meanwhile, on the Warrior the ship is on line - almost literally!
A little after 5am, she crossed the 12 mile limit surrounding
Moruroa; the chief engineer took off the automatic overspeed
controls on her two engines, put his foot to the floor, and the
old girl surged to 11 knots.  Half a mile out from the pass,
the French commandos belatedly make their move.  Boarding the
boat from inflatables, they surround the bridge deck.  Within a
minute or two they realise that all the doors have been bolted
from the inside to prevent them entering and taking control of
the ship.  Things now begin to move very fast.  A moment's
gesticulation by an officer in front of the bridge windows, and
then a hammer exploded glass into the face of the captain and
first mate.  Next instant, a tear gas cannister came flying in. 
Immediately, the bridge was evacuated and everyone went below,
with the skipper turning the engine off as everyone files down
the stairs into the lower accomodation.  But it is no use. The
ship rapidly fills with tear gas. In the confined area of a
ship's alleyways within a minute it was unbearable.  Everyone
assembled in the mess within seconds, as arranged for an
emergency, and as they did to the ship was rammed by the French
tug Rari on the starboard bow-- three times.  The decision was
immediately taken to evacuate the interior of the ship and the
captain went below to tell the chief engineer, while the rest of
those aboard, including two priest, five journalists and the
mayor of the largest city in French Polynesia, left through the
main doorway and spilled out onto the main deck, eyes burning,
gasping for air.

<p>Only three people remained inside as French commandos -
resplendent in black catsuits, balaclavas and gas masks, poured
in.  These three were the radio operator and the two campaigners
who had organised and run this protest right from the beginning. 
As the campaigners conducted live phone interviews to the outside
world, describing what is happening, and the radio operator
drives his computer to pump out the last moments of video before
the cameraman has to drop his video camera and run, the commandos
set about the steel door of the radio room with a fire axe. 
Within a couple of minutes they have managed to chop through the
doubled skinned sea-door and make a slit open into the radio
room.  Through this slit they squirt tear gas from an aerosol
cannister, while continuing to hack at the door with the axe. 
As the radio room is only 12 feet by eight (4 metres by 2.5) it
very quickly become uninhabitable.  The radio operator and one
of the campaigners bolt through the porthole and clamber up the
side of the ship to the deck above, their eyes red and streaming
from the gas.  The third campaigner is too big to get through the
porthole, and spend ten to fifteen minutes with his head out of
hte porthole gulping fresh air -- and continue to tell French
radio what is going on-- until the commandoes finally manage to
break their way in and drag him out.

<p>By now, the Warrior is tied up to a tug right in the middle of
the pass, engines stopped.  Everyone has been "arrested" on board
by the French, or are at least under guard. But the Rainbow has
made it into the pass -- at the cost of huge disruption to the
French base at Moruroa and their testing programme.  Of the
inflatables, all four have made it not only into the lagoon, but
right down the length of it into the heart of the base.  Four
people have boarded the drilling rig, and one successfully locked
themselves to that rig.  The other two boats made it into the
immediate vicinity of the rig, but allowed themselves to be taken
as by then they were faced with a mele of legionnaires, boats and
helicopters around the rig.  From there, we are taken to Moruroa
and held for questioning for more than 14 hours. But that is
another story. In the meantime, I think we might just have
spoiled their Sunday morning!

<H4>Account by Alan Baker and Matthew Whiting, Greenpeace activists
on Moruroa Atoll during the first French test.</H4> 
  
<br>Date:Sunday 10th September 1995 
<br>Subject: Diary update</H4>
<body><br> 
 

<P><I>3rd September 1995</I>

<P>00.05hrs: Dropped from the yacht La Ribaud approx 15 miles from
the exclusion zone (30 miles from the atoll). Travelled in a
zodiac inflatable towing two sea kayaks and carrying flares,
cameras, telephones, navigation equipment and food and water for
two days.
 
<P>0240: Landed at the atoll and leaving the inflatable dragged the
kayaks across the coral and launched them in the lagoon.
 
<P>0400: After paddling for two hours they found bushes to
camouflage themselves, the canoes and the equipment and hid.  
0700: Helicopters circle the bushes close enough for the two to
see the faces of the crew. Both then slept.
 
<P>1810: Matt paddled toward the life zone with an arrangement for
Al to set off distress flares in two hours time as a distraction
tactic.
 
<P>approx 2000: After paddling for a couple of hours Matt
camouflaged the canoe on an unpopulated part of the island and
began to walk towards the Life Zone. Al sets off first distress
flare at campsite.

<P><I>4th September, 1995</I>
<P>approx 0200: Al paddled toward test rig and set off a second
flare 400 yards from the drilling rig. A patrol boat passed
without seeing him.
 
<P>approx 0400: After paddling across the lagoon Al set off a third
distress flare. He continued to paddle towards the inhabited end
of the atoll in choppy waters and surrounded by sharks.
 
<P>approx 0200-0400: About 50 metres away from a military radio
tower, Matt saw a number of people come out of the bushes. He ran
towards the lagoon and began to swim towards the Life zone.  He
swam approx 1km before coming ashore near an industrial complex
in the Life Zone where he walked amongst the buildings sticking
NON stickers on buildings, posts, barrack doors and a telephone
box outside the police station. Took photographs. Headed towards
the airport taking photographs before heading back to where he
had left the canoe.
 
<P>On the way back he was spotted by French parachute marines and
again attempted to hide by jumping into the water. He was grabbed
by the wrists, thrown on to the ground and held at gunpoint. He
was pinned down and his hands tied behind his back and to his
ankles, so that his hands touched his ankles. They put a nylon
cord round his neck and tied it to the rope holding his arms and
feet, swinging him from side to side and dragging him along the
ground. One of the soldiers smashed the butt of the gun against
his elbow and then his knee cap before putting the muzzle to his
forehead and threatening to kill him if he didn't tell where the
other people were. He told them there was only one other. They
also poked him in the back with covered bayonets, cutting his
back.
 
<P>Matt was picked up by the rope that was around his neck and
thrown into the back of a white van. He was taken to the radio
tower and handed over to the gendarmes. He was then taken to the
gendarmerie station and treated at the infirmary for his wounds.
He received four stitches to the elbow, iodine to the rope burns
on his neck and his knee was x-rayed, showing a hairline
fracture. He was then interrogated for several hours at the
gendarmerie and at daylight was taken to a concrete cell.  

<P>0700: Concerned about radiation he may have been exposed to
overnight on the atoll and the possibility of the test taking
place, Al decided to hand himself in. He saw a helicopter fly
over and then pass over again before spotting his canoe. The
helicopter hovered over the canoe destabilising it; Al signalled
to the helicopter to back off, fearing being tipped over. He then
set off a fourth smoke flare and signalled the direction he was
paddling. The helicopter followed. Three inflatables came towards
the canoe, 1 with approx seven armed men and two other with
approx three legionnaires in each. He paddled toward them
signalling to slow down, then came alongside, reached out and
climbed on board.

<P>Both men were left in separate cells when the bomb was exploded
while all other personnel were taken to a safety platform.  
<P>Matt: "I was lying on a mattress on top of a concrete bed and I
literally raised off the mattress when the bomb went off. Imagine
lying on a single bed with someone lying underneath and then
kicking you sharply from under the mattress. There was a
thunderous bang and then you could feel the shockwaves cruise
through the land."  

Al: "I could hear over the intercom a countdown every ten minutes
or so, I was waiting for them to come and get me and put me on
the safety platform when the bomb went off. The place was
deserted. I heard a siren and then the floor appeared to drop and
then come up and then drop again. I heard a very loud muffled
bang and at the same time I could hear the room settling down and
the timber and concrete creaking back into place. I couldn't
believe that they didn't come and get us so that we could be on
the safety platform when the test went off."  
 
<P>After 48 hours both men were handed over the Foreign Legion
because the gendarme could not hold them for any longer without
charging them. They were held for a further two and a half days
before being flown to Papeete and then escorted by a dozen riot
police armed with pump action shot guns to the Papeete
gendarmerie. They were searched and handcuffed and then taken
before a judge who told them they were to be deported to Paris.
They were then held in a garage for six hours with Matt's ankle
cuffed to Al's hand. They were then handed over to the Tahitian
national police who loaded them onto a commercial Air France
flight. At Los Angeles they attempted to leave the plane but were
again detained before being flown to Paris where they were met
by French special branch and uniformed police officers who drove
them to a twin-propped plane. They were flown to London City
airport, arriving at approx 18.30 on 10th September, 1995.

<h1>MV Greenpeace Amazonian Expedition</h1>

<a><IMG SRC="4decki.gif" alt="MV Greenpeace"></a>

During October 1994, the environmental ship MV Greenpeace made 
an expedition from the mouth of the Amazon up to the Rio Negro and 
thence back down to the Atlantic Ocean.  This trip was part of a
long campaign for the forests which took the ship from Siberia to British
Columbia to Central America to Brazil. The purpose of the 
journey was to publisise some of the many threats to the future of the 
forests in these areas.

<p>

While in Brazil, the activities of the MV Greenpeace included 
public outreach and non-violent direct actions to highlight 
the following issues.

<h3>>> MV GREENPEACE HELICOPTER PILOT SAVES A WHALE</h3>

SOUTHERN OCEAN, ANTARCTICA, 18 February 1995 (GP) As
confrontations between the 
<a href="mvgp.html">MV GREENPEACE</a>
 and the Japanese whaling
fleet <a href="0214kyo2.gif">
<img align=middle src="214kyo2i.gif" alt="(Front view) ">188KB GIF</a> or
<a href="0214kyo2.jpg">57KB JPG,</a>
escalate in the Antarctic whale sanctuary today, 
US citizens aboard the Greenpeace ship called on Vice President Al
Gore to honour his commitment to the sanctuary by protesting to
Japan.
<p>
The MV GREENPEACE crew have saved another minke whale from the
Japanese harpoons in their latest in a week-long series of
confrontations with the whaling fleet in the newly created whale
sanctuary.
<p>
Earlier today, Greenpeace helicopter pilot Paula Huckleberry
found the Japanese catcher boat Toshi Maru No. 18 chasing a minke
whale just ahead of the catcher's bow.
<p>
Exclusive Greenpeace footage shows Huckleberry swooping down
toward the scene, calling the whalers on VHF radio.

<img align=top src="whaler2i.gif" alt="Helicopter in front of whaler catcher ">212KB GIF</a> or
<a href="whaler2.jpg">64KB JPG.</a>
<br></br>
"Toshi Maru
No. 18,this is the Greenpeace helicopter on your starboard side,"
Huckleberry told them. "Do not shoot the whale, move your crew
away from the harpoon."
<p>
The whalers quickly lost interest in the hunt and the minke
turned sharply and swam away. 
<p>
Huckleberry is one of five US citizens onboard the MV Greenpeace
who today wrote to US Vice President Al Gore's Internet address,
asking him to formally protest to the Japanese Government.  Vice
President Gore last year publicly backed the establishment of the
Southern Ocean Sanctuary. 
<p>
The sanctuary was created by a vote of 23-1 with Japan completely
isolated, at last year's meeting of the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) in Mexico.  The Japanese fleet has continued its
so-called "scientific" whale hunt -- the meat it produces retails
in Tokyo's markets and restaurants for up to $US160 a pound.  
"Over the past 10 days we have shown the world what the Japanese
whaling fleet does not want it to see -- <br>

<img src="0215nm1i.gif" alt="Whale being flensed ">147KB GIF</a> or 
<a href="0215nm1.jpg">44KB JPG</a> minke whales killed in
the name of science but flensed and processed for market," said
Greenpeace whales campaigner Kieran Mulvaney onboard the MV
GREENPEACE.
<p>
"Greenpeace will continue to put ourselves between the whalers
and whales for as long as we can stay here in Antarctica," said
Mulvaney.

<a href="0215tm18.jpg">51KB JPG,</a>
<br></br>
 "But we obviously can't stop the whale hunt by
ourselves.  It's up to the 23 governments and their citizens who
created the sanctuary this year to convince Japan to stop its
hunt and call back its whaling fleet."

<title>GREENPEACE TRACKING NUCLEAR WASTE SHIPMENT</title>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Nuclear Waste Shipment</h1>

<P>

The countries marked in green in this 

<a href="pintail.gif">

<img src="worldi.gif" alt="World ">map in GIF (12KB)</a>

have voiced opposition or taken action to prevent the high level nuclear waste shipment from passing through their territorial waters.  They include: Uruguay, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Portugal, Equador, Fiji, Dutch Antilles, Jamaica, Philip

pines, Chile, Spain, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Commonwealth of Dominica, Dominican Republic, Federated States of Micronesia, British and US Virgin Islands, Honduras, Aruba, Hawaii, Ethiopia, South Africa, Republic of Nauru, Mauritius, Antigua and Barbuda.



   <P>Greenpeace's fastest and longest-range ship, MV Solo, is

currently tracking a shipment of plutonium waste on its still

undisclosed route from a French reprocessing plant to its country

of origin, Japan.  The waste ship, the Pacific Pintail, left

France on 23rd February amidst protests by Greenpeace and local

people living near the plant.  As of early March some 25 nations have voiced 

opposition to the nuclear waste shipment or denied the ship access through their territorial waters.

<P>This is the first time high level nuclear waste from reprocessing has been 

returned to its country of origin.  However, the French and British 

reprocessing industry plans to return over 3,000 blocks of plutonium waste to 

Japan in the course of the next 10 to 15 years.  Although they originally 

promised to be open

about the shipment, France, Japan and the United Kingdom -- those

responsible for this trade -- have refused to reveal the nuclear

waste shipment's secret route. 

 <P>Despite the tremendous risks involved in such shipments, 

the authorities involved in this trade have been unwilling to

conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of their

program.  They have also been unwilling to provide the necessary

information to nations along the potential routes and may be

put at risk.  As a result, countries in Africa, Asia, the

Caribbean, Central America, Latin America and the South Pacific

have protested and/or banned the transports.

	Nuclear weapons technology is an extremely sensitive
	subject.  Not only is a veil of secrecy drawn across the technical details of nuclear weapons and their means of 
production, but there is much concealment about the nuclear ambitions and activities of individual countries, if 
and how these countries might be attempting to develop nuclear weapons and, indeed, if they already have a 
stockpile of nuclear weapons. <P>
	This report identifies the means of production and outlines the technological 'know how' required for a country to 
embark upon a nuclear weapons programme, but it is not claimed that  any country that has developed or is 
developing such civil nuclear facilities  has the intent to procure nuclear weapons by these means.  The views 
and findings expressed in this study are those of the author and not necessarily shared by Greenpeace.<P>
<P>


<H2>		DUAL CAPABLE NUCLEAR 
TECHNOLOGY</H2>
<H2><A NAME=h_summary> </A> 
</H2>
<H2>		SUMMARY</H2>
	This reports reviews the potential use of civil nuclear power reactors and fuel plants in procuring 
materials for a nuclear weapons arsenal.  <P>
	The findings are, that as civil nuclear power technology advances and is passed to  nations who, from 
this, might themselves  develop their own independent, domestic nuclear industry, it is  becoming 
increasingly more suited to fulfilling a dual capable role. It is also clear that these plants can directly 
and openly, or by diversion, produce the nuclear materials required for a nuclear warhead.  It is  shown 
that the conventional materials, required for a nuclear weapons programme, may be directly 
manufactured by most countries who already have or who are in the process of establishing a civil 
nuclear industry.<P>
	The need to demonstrate nuclear capability by nuclear testing is considered.  It is concluded that for 
countries with relatively advanced scientific and technological infrastructures, nuclear weapons testing 
is not an essential prerequisite to nuclear weapons capability.<P>
	A  nuclear warhead is a complex, precision assembly requiring very high quality  refined materials.  
These technological and material production demands would seem to set back acquisition of practical 
nuclear weapons, of significant explosive yield, to sub- national and terrorist groups by several years or 
more into the future.  Of course, this does not mean that such groups, in possession of even sub-grade 
nuclear materials and relatively primitive fabrication facilities, could not produce 'radiation' bombs 
capable of a slight nuclear yield sufficient to disperse fission products and radioactive debris over a 
large area. This type of terrorist weapon would, perhaps, be more threatening and damaging than the 
conventional explosive devices available today.<P>
	The real risk of further proliferation of nuclear weapons remains with countries who have or who are 
developing a civil nuclear power industry.  As advanced civil nuclear technology is traded from the 
established nuclear civil power nations, countries developing nuclear power are striking for 
independence in the fuel cycle, building up their own domestic nuclear fuel industries. These plants, 
including  uranium conversion and enrichment facilities, research and power reactors, and reprocessing 
plants,  are all capable of producing the military grades of fissile materials required for nuclear 
warheads.  Several  countries, excluded from the 'club' of nuclear weapons nations, now have the 
technology of nuclear weapons material production that has been safeguarded by the nuclear weapons 
nations for the last 40 to 50 years.  Like the nuclear plants and fissile materials, the intellectual know-
how  needed to design and assemble a nuclear warhead, also of 50 years vintage, has also slipped 
through the non-proliferation safeguarding system.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	In effect,  the time scale required to switch nuclear production facilities from civil to military use is 
relatively short (a few years or less depending on the capacity of the plants), so any country  that has the 
means of production and nuclear weapons 'know how' can pose a proliferation threat at some point in 
time, given a situation in which motivation for this arises.<P>
	Finally, this report briefly examines the technical safeguards implemented by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) in discharging its responsibilities of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 
conclusion is that not only are the safeguards technically inadequate but that, moreover, the parallel 
role of the IAEA to encourage technology transfer and application of civil nuclear power compromises 
and endangers its non-proliferation role.<P>

<H2>	DUAL CAPABLE NUCLEAR 
TECHNOLOGY</H2>
<H3><A NAME=h_military_use_of_nuclear_materials_a> </A> </H3>
<H3>Military Use of Nuclear Materials and 
Processes</H3>
In its simplest from, all of the nuclear materials required to build a nuclear warhead derive from natural  
uranium.   The  energy  that  produces  the   explosive yield is the culmination of the very rapid, near 
instantaneous, fissioning of these materials.  <P>
An atomic or A-bomb may be constructed using a few tens of kilograms of highly enriched fissile uranium. 
 This requires an enrichment plant to raise the low content of the fissile isotope of uranium (U235 at 0.7%) 
existing naturally, to  a very high level of concentration (> 90%) by displacing the normally non-fissile 
isotope U238.  Large quantities of natural uranium, in the form of milled uranium, refined to yellowcake 
and then converted to uranium hexafluoride, are required for this process. The depleted uranium (U238) by-
product can be used as part of the fissile core of a nuclear warhead, first to contain the nuclear process and, 
instants later, contributing to the fission energy release.<P>
To increase the yield and  reliability of yield of an A- bomb,  the enriched uranium can be replaced with a 
few kilograms of highly fissile plutonium.  Plutonium is produced by reprocessing natural or low-enriched 
uranium spent fuel that has been irradiated in a nuclear reactor. This requires a fuel fabrication plant, a  
moderated or thermal reactor, and a reprocessing or chemical separation plant.<P>
To advance the design of an A-bomb, it is advantageous to boost the initial fissioning of the plutonium. 
This is achieved by introducing a spurt of neutrons to the fissile heart of the warhead, either with a small 
pea- sized source of radioactive polonium combined with beryllium, or by creating neutrons from the 
fusing a few grams of radioactive tritium and deuterium.  Both of these techniques require a nuclear reactor 
to generate the radioactive materials, and conventional chemical plants to isolate either the deuterium or 
beryllium, and to provide  lithium as a source of tritium.<P>
The yield of the warhead can be increased if the atomic fission stage, the A-bomb, is used to trigger a 
second stage involving fusion. This is the basis of a thermonuclear  or H-bomb. For this, the intense and 
almost instantaneous energy of the A-bomb is deployed to fuse a few kilograms of tritium and deuterium.  
The tritium is generated within the warhead from a fusion fuel of lithium-deuteride, a simple hydride of 
lithium metal and heavy water, produced by conventional chemical processes.  Further increase in the 
nuclear yield is gained if the energy from the fusion stage is applied to fissioning a mantle of depleted 
uranium (U238).<P>
<p>

</B> schematically illustrates the nuclear and conventional chemical plants required to 
produce the materials for a nuclear weapon arsenal programme.  <B>APPENDIX II</B> provides further 
details of the types and quantities of nuclear and conventional materials required for the construction of 
atomic and thermonuclear warheads.<P>
<H3><A NAME=h_civil_use_of_nuclear_materials_and_> </A> </H3>
<H3>Civil Use of Nuclear Materials and 
Processes</H3>
In a nuclear power station, electricity is generated from the heat liberated by uranium fission.   This heat is 
extracted from the core of a  nuclear reactor charged with natural or low-enriched uranium fuel.  The heat 
is used to raise steam to drive conventional turbo- alternator plant.<P>
For civil nuclear power, facilities and plants are required for prepare and enrich the uranium, to fabricate 
this into fuel and, to fission this fuel, a thermal or moderated nuclear reactor.  These processes and plants 
give rise to low enriched and depleted uranium, ceramic and metal fuels, and from the reactors spent or 
irradiated fuel.  The fuel cycle can be extended to include reprocessing spent fuel to separate depleted and 
any remaining enriched uranium, and fissile plutonium and radioactive wastes.  The uranium and 
plutonium yields of reprocessing spent fuel can be recycled as fuel, particularly the plutonium which can be 
deployed, in low concentrations, as mixed oxide fuel with uranium (MOX) in more advanced thermal 
reactors (such as pressurised water reactors), and in greater concentration in fast reactors, or in 
combination with depleted uranium in fast breeder reactors.<P>
<B><A HREF="fig02.gif">FIGURE 2</A></B> shows the civil nuclear plants required to operate the nuclear fuel cycle with power 
generating reactors.<P>
<p>


Alongside civil nuclear power generation research, development and industrial applications also involve a 
number of nuclear processes and materials.  Research reactors are, typically,  small, low powered reactors 
fuelled with highly enriched uranium metal fuels contained within a beryllium reflector shielded core;  
radio-isotopes for medical and industrial applications, including tritium and polonium, are produced in 
reactors and accelerators; and a few nations operate marine reactors in nuclear-powered icebreakers and 
submarines, fuelled by moderately and highly enriched adaptations of the pressurised water reactor 
(PWR).<P>
 <P>
<H3><A NAME=h_nuclear_industrial_infrastructure> </A> </H3>
<H3>Nuclear Industrial Infrastructure</H3>
The first point to note is that  military and civil nuclear activities share, for the atomic bomb and the atomic 
trigger of the thermonuclear warhead, the same nuclear processes and materials.  In a  nuclear warhead the 
uranium and plutonium fissile materials are highly enriched and refined, and the process of fission is 
achieved very rapidly for the nuclear detonation.  In civil applications, notably in nuclear power stations 
and research reactors, the process (intensity) of fission is drawn out, and the enrichment of uranium 
relatively modest, although the refined purity of both uranium and plutonium is very high.<P>
The second point is that the processes of manufacture, procuring, refining and enriching these materials 
are exactly the same for both military and civil needs.  It is only the level of enrichment of uranium and 
degree of isotopic refinement of plutonium that distinguishes these materials between military and civil 
uses.  This means that, essentially, the same plants can be used to isolate and process these materials, it is 
only the extent of processing and the controls applied that distinguishes between military and civil grades 
of these materials.<P>
The third point is that as civil applications of nuclear power advance there is a wider crossover  into the 
domain which has been until recent years almost exclusive to the military. This particularly applies to 
plutonium which  had virtually no civil nuclear power application as a reactor fuel, other than in a few 
research and development fast reactors and for which there is little chance of commercial application in the 
near and medium- term future. However, during the last few years plutonium has been adopted as a mixed 
oxide fuel (MOX) fuel for the relatively commonplace PWR civil power reactors.   If the use of plutonium 
in civil nuclear power stations becomes established, the transfer and use of plutonium throughout the 
World could become common currency.<P>
<p>


 <P>
It is the emerging use of plutonium in civil nuclear power that is the primary cause of concern with regard 
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons capability throughout the World.<P>
<H4><A NAME=h_nuclear_technology_transfer> </A> </H4>
<H4>Nuclear Technology Transfer</H4>
It used to be that the largest and most difficult part of the preparation for a nuclear warhead programme  
was the need for individual countries to establish a specialised industrial base to develop and produce the  
technologies and materials needed for nuclear weapons.  The, once the technology had been established 
and prototype nuclear weapons manufactured, it was necessary to prove the devices by nuclear test.<P>
In other words, in the early years and in the absence of wide-scale civil nuclear power, progression  towards 
acquisition of nuclear weapons was readily transparent by the large scale and speciality of the plants and 
factories required and, ultimately, by nuclear weapons testing.<P>
For example, in the post World-War II years, the United Kingdom expended considerable effort in its 
nuclear weapons development programme. Because of post-war shortages, the UK was forced along the 
plutonium fissile pit route, being unable to develop the highly enriched uranium weapon designs (which 
were much more certain in achieving a successful outcome)see Note 1 since it could not, then, procure the 
plant to produce highly enriched uranium at the rate and in the quantities required.  For this, the United 
Kingdom invested in massive factories at Windscale, Aldermaston and Springfields aligning these to 
plutonium production and, as its warhead programme developed, it committed the design and operation of 
a whole series of graphite moderated reactors at civil nuclear power plants, the Magnox power stations, to 
plutonium production. This combined civil-military programme  required considerable investment of both 
economic and scientific resource.2   <P>
<p>


<P>
				Now, nuclear technology and the nature of industrialisation has changed, so 
much so that it is quite practical for relatively non-industrialised countries to complete nuclear materials 
supply and procurement  in support of a  civil nuclear power programme but which, by intent or 
incidentally, provides  capability and opportunity for nuclear weapons development.  The  overlap of civil 
and military nuclear technologies  increases as a result of the established nuclear nations providing 
advanced civil reactor and nuclear processes to countries stepping into nuclear power, and then by  these 
countries themselves casting off dependence upon the established nations with the introduction of their 
own plants, particularly  nuclear fuel cycle facilities including uranium enrichment and irradiated fuel 
reprocessing plants. These emerging nuclear countries have, in recent years, commenced nuclear trading 
between themselves, transferring materials, technicians and technology.<P>
The outcome of these changes is that, whereas all of the key design and manufacturing technologies of 
nuclear weapons were controlled by and kept within the boundaries of a few nations, now the technologies 
are dispersed over many countries who are free to trade amongst themselves. Indeed, it could be argued 
that the technology of design and construction of nuclear warheads has been well within the grasp of most 
technologically based countries during the last 10 to 15 years,3  so now that the supply of nuclear materials 
has been freed any country with a relatively advanced civil nuclear programme could, if it had the intent, 
develop and manufacture nuclear weapons.<P>
<H4><A NAME=h_nuclear_weapons_testing> </A> 
</H4>
<H4>Nuclear Weapons Testing</H4>
Nuclear weapons testing, first atmospheric and, later, underground detonations, demonstrated the nuclear 
capability of individual nations.  Remote monitoring of atmospheric fall-out and the seismic disturbance 
provided a reliable indication of the status of weapons development achieved by individual nations.<P>
Following the US atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, other  nations rapidly joined the nuclear 
warhead club, proving nuclear capability with successful nuclear test detonations:<P>
<p>


                                              <P>
<pre><B>	Country				A-Bomb		H-Bomb</B><P>

	However,  the omission of nuclear weapons testing<P>
	should not be taken to mean an individual country has not acquired nuclear weapons capability.6  
It is quite possible for a nation to develop a nuclear capability in the absence of testing, especially 
if there has been design and data transfer from an established nuclear nation that has tested.<P>
<H4><A NAME=h_dual_capable_nuclear_plants> </A> </H4>
<H4>	Dual Capable Nuclear Plants</H4>
	As previously discussed, the fissile components of a nuclear warhead can be made up of either 
highly enriched uranium-235 or from a smaller quantity of plutonium which is rich in the 
plutonium-239 isotope. For both plutonium and uranium designs,  a few kilograms of depleted 
uranium are required to contain the early stages of detonation, a few grams of tritium-deuterium 
or, alternatively, polonium to initiate the nuclear sequence, some conventional beryllium and high 
explosives and, if the warhead is to include a fusion stage, a fuel pack of lithium- deuteride, a few 
more kilograms of plutonium or enriched uranium, and  a further 20kg of depleted uranium for 
the fusion-fission mantle.<P>
	First, consider the primary fissile materials options for the core of a nuclear weapon:<P>
	  <P>
<H4>	Enriched Uranium</H4>
	For a high yield (10 to 20kt) nuclear detonation fuelled by uranium, the fissile mass at the heart of 
the warhead needs to comprise uranium metal enriched to a level in excess of 90% U235.  This 
applies to both 'gun' and 'implosion' configurations of the warhead fissile pit, although with 
considerable loss of detonation efficiency, say perhaps achieving a 0.5 to 2-5kt yield, it is possible 
to construct a 'gun' configuration with  fissile core components of about 70% to 80% U235 
enrichment level.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	There are a number of means of enriching natural uranium to higher levels.7  The primary means 
used for civil fuel production are cascaded gaseous diffusion and centrifuge plants.  Other 
enrichment techniques, such as the  earlier jet and vortex wall separators  have fallen into 
commercial disuse because of the very high energy consumption and uneconomic conversion 
rates achievable.  <P>
	The general rule is that the efficacy of the uranium separation process reduces for both extremes, 
that is  enrichment becomes increasingly more difficult the higher the enrichment of the product 
and the lower the content of U235 in the feedstock.8  Another difficulty is that as the enrichment 
level rises, the stages have to be reduced in volume to avoid criticality, this generally requires that 
processing through the final thousand  or more stages  has to be continuous and not batched.<P>
	Nevertheless, apart from the difficulties of scale of both the enrichment  and the associated  
uranium hexafluoride feed plants, uranium enrichment to nuclear warhead levels is entirely 
practicable in plants designed to produce moderately low levels of  enrichment for civil power 
station and R&amp D reactors (2% to 20%).  Essentially, it is a matter of batching the process, by 
stretching and/or recycling,9 at the penalty of rendering an already lengthy cycle even lengthier.  
For example, a civil gas diffusion type plant of 5,000 stages, capable of annually producing, say, 
500kg of 20% enriched uranium for research reactor fuel, could be readily adapted to yield 25kg 
or so of 90% enriched uranium per year -  this is sufficient for the manufacture of a single, 
enriched uranium A-bomb warhead per year. <P>
	  <P>
	In effect, all enrichment plants are dual capable in that low, moderate and highly enriched 
uranium can be produced for both civil and military applications.<P>
<p>


	 <P>
<H4>	Depleted Uranium</H4>
	Depleted uranium arises in very large quantities as a by-product of the enrichment process.  All 
that is needed is to reduce uranium from the uranium hexafluoride to an oxide, and finish this in 
a metal plant.<P>
	Depleted uranium is a dual capable material.<P>
<H4>	Plutonium</H4>
	Again for about a 20kt yield atomic warhead, a core<P>
	containing between 3kg to 5kg of plutonium is required - for an implosion type warhead this 
would comprise a hollow plutonium sphere of about 80mm external diameter.<P>
	Plutonium is produced in a nuclear reactor by the U238 capture of a neutron.  The nuclear 
sequence requires, first, a fission of U235 in the reactor fuel to release a neutron, capture by U238, 
and transformation of this through a short-lived decay chain to the relatively stable Pu239 with a 
half- life of 24,300 years.15  So long as fissile and fertile material (U235 and U238) are available in 
the core, any reactor will produce a proportion of plutonium integrated within the fuel matrix.  
Since Pu239 is a fissile material it, once established, will also be subject to fissioning, so under the 
right conditions the Pu239 also transmutes to Pu240 which will subsequently be available to fission 
to Pu241 and Pu242.<P>
	This interplay between the uranium isotopes and fissioning of the plutonium produces an 
exponential relationship in the decay and growth of U235 and Pu239 respectively in the reactor core 
over time. Essentially, the aggregate increase of Pu239 reaches a saturation point as the fission rate 
of the Pu239 increases, this is accompanied by a greater content of the other plutonium isotopes, 
whilst the U235  decreases down to a level at which the reactor requires refuelling to maintain 
criticality.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	Ideally, the plutonium required for a nuclear warhead should maximise the Pu239 content,1 so  
subsequent fissioning of Pu239 has to be inhibited by either removing the plutonium yielding fuel  
from the reactor at a very low burn-up and/or by constraining this fission whilst the plutonium 
bearing fuel remains in the active core of the reactor.  <P>
	For the first of these objectives, the ideal period for plutonium breeding in a relatively low power  
reactor core is between four to eight months.  Accordingly, it would be very disruptive to have to 
close down the reactor for dismantling at this frequency so, for this reason, the large, high- 
powered light water reactors (PWR and BWR) are not well suited to plutonium production since 
these types of reactor require 6 to 8 weeks outage at each refuelling outage.  Selective fuel channel 
withdrawal  can be achieved by using reactors that are capable of refuelling whilst on load, such 
as the UK Magnox power station reactors that, in the past, contributed strongly to the UK's 
plutonium production programme.  Other reactor core configurations, such as on-load refuelling 
heavy water moderated reactors are also suited to maximise Pu239 production.  The second 
objective of constraining plutonium fissioning can be met, to a limited extent, by control of the 
neutron absorption window at which Pu239 is more amenable to fission, although this is not a 
really practical proposition in a larger electricity generating power station in which the reactor is 
also utilised for plutonium breeding.<P>
	Generally, both graphite moderated gas-cooled and heavy water moderated reactors with on-load 
refuelling are dual capable, in that these reactors are designed (or may be adapted) for breeding 
plutonium as well as power production. It is these types of reactors, both research and civil power, 
that strongly feature in the reactor inventory of countries nuclear weapons programmes - the UK's 
1950- 60s research and power reactor programmes included both types, which are now 
acknowledged to have been used to support nuclear weapons development.10<P>

<H4><A NAME=h_plutonium_recovery> </A> 
</H4>
<H4>	Plutonium Recovery</H4>
	Unlike  enriched uranium, which only requires conversion to its elemental metal form for use in a 
nuclear warhead, the plutonium has to be extracted from the spent reactor fuel by chemical 
separation or reprocessing.<P>
	In outline, a reprocessing plant receives irradiated fuel  withdrawn from nuclear reactors, it 
mechanically breaks down the fuel, dissolves it in acid, and then sets about separating the three 
constituent parts depleted uranium, plutonium and highly radioactive waste fission products, by 
passing the  fluid mix between aqueous and solvent phases in batches.  Of the three products, the 
fission waste is sent to storage for ultimate disposal, the depleted uranium to storage and possible 
re-use as fuel blend for reactors, and the plutonium recovered as a oxide powder.  The  processes 
of chemical separation cannot distinguish the various isotopes of plutonium, so plutonium 
extracted by reprocessing comprises the  plutonium isotopic signature as generated in the reactor 
core.<P>
	Commercial or civil reprocessing plants are very large installations, such as the  Magnox and 
THORP plants operated by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield. However, such plants are not 
dependent upon scale for success and quite efficient chemical separation can be achieved by small 
sized plants.  The range of scale of reprocessing plants can be gauged by comparison of BNFL's 
Sellafield   Magnox plant at 1,500 spent fuel tonnes/year and THORP at 1,200t/y compared, for 
example,  to the 30t/y plant at Trombay in India and, recently  commissioned, the pilot plant at 
Ezeiza in Argentina at 5t/y. <P>
	Once recovered, plutonium is usually stored in  oxide powder form waiting to be passed to a 
finishing plant.  If used for reactor fuel the powder is sintered into small ceramic pellets which are 
assembled into fuel pins. For fast reactor fuel the plutonium is neat within a carrying matrix, and 
for MOX fuel the plutonium is blended at about 7% concentration with uranium oxide before 
being sintered into a pellet.  <P>
<p>


	<P>
	To form the fissile core or 'pit' of a nuclear warhead, the plutonium oxide is reduced to its 
extremely dense elemental metal form. This yields small buttons which are then cast into an ingot 
of plutonium alloyed with a trace metal, such as gallium, to ease subsequent machining.11  The 
metal uranium components of a nuclear warhead are finished using similar processes.<P>
	Such post fuel-irradiation reprocessing and finishing plants are all dual capable. Since these are, 
essentially, small batch-quantity plants, consignments can be processed separately to suit the end 
use, be it fuel for advanced civil reactors or plutonium metal for nuclear warhead production.<P>

<H3>	Military Use of Enriched Uranium and 
Plutonium</H3>
<H4><A NAME=h_enriched_uranium> </A> </H4>
<H4>	Enriched Uranium</H4>
	The level of enrichment of uranium is an index of the content of the fissile U235 isotope with the 
remaining fraction comprising, almost entirely, the relatively stable U238 isotope.  The application 
of the level of enrichment for nuclear warhead applications is straightforward, being that 
enrichment levels of 90% and greater are required for a successful and high yield nuclear 
detonation.12<P>
	 <P>
<H4><A NAME=h_plutonium> </A> </H4>
<H4>	Plutonium</H4>
	The application of plutonium in nuclear warheads is not so straightforward.  This is because the 
plutonium recovered in reprocessing spent fuel contains the same isotopic mix of  all the 
plutonium created and subsequently fissioned in the reactor core (238, 239, 240, 241 and 242 
isotopes of plutonium).<P>
	Ideally, plutonium for a nuclear warhead should almost wholly  comprise the highly fissile isotope 
Pu239.  This is because other plutonium isotopes are gamma- emitters generating heat, certain 
absorb neutrons  and/or cause pre-detonation.  These undesirable characteristics present radiation 
exposure difficulties during the manufacture and storage of the weapons, excess heat in the 
warhead core will accelerate degradation of other components and pre-detonation precludes 
certain warhead configurations being adopted.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	The isotope Pu240 is particularly problematical for two reasons:  First, it can be generated in the 
fissile mass by Pu239 absorption of a neutron without fissioning, thus impeding full fission, and, 
secondly, it itself undergoes spontaneous fission which can generate sufficient energy during the 
compression process to 'pre-detonate', blowing the fissile pit apart before the Pu239 fissioning can 
reach the optimum rate to progress to a full nuclear yield.  For this reason, Pu240 bearing 
plutonium is not  used in 'gun' type warheads since the fissile mass 'assembly velocity' is not fast 
enough to preclude pre-detonation.<P>
	In fact, although a correctly sequenced fission process will yield  enormous energy, the assembly 
itself is relatively frail in  physical containment, crucially dependent on the correct sequencing, 
needing the initial and staging geometries to be precisely maintained.  The magnitude of pre- 
detonation energy to disrupt and halt the fission process is small, believed to be of the explosive 
energy equivalent to about 4 lbs (~2kg) of conventional TNT. <P>
	Generally, plutonium is graded in terms of its civil and military applications by the Pu240 content. 
 For nuclear weapons, 'Weapons Grade' plutonium is defined to include no more than 6% to 7% 
Pu240 with a maximum of 93.5% Pu239 - over this  Pu240 level  the pre-detonation problem 
becomes significant. For recycled reactor fuel, the  so-called 'Reactor' or 'Fuel Grade' might 
include from between 8% to 10%  up to 18% to 19% Pu240 and, higher, at 24% for a high burn-up 
fuel source, say, from  a commercial PWR power station. <P>
	Since reprocessing is a batch process it is quite practical to be selective in the fuel reprocessed, 
that is batching low burn-up fuels which will yield the lower Pu240 content - this is why the on-
load refuelling reactors, such as the Magnox and heavy water reactors (both research and power), 
are so important in plutonium breeding.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	Quite obviously the advanced nuclear weapons nations (US, Russian Federation, Britain, France 
and China) can be selective with plutonium, since these nations operate dedicated military 
facilities. The question is whether countries developing nuclear weapons, with limited access to 
'Weapons Grade' plutonium, can utilise lower grade material to establish a nuclear weapons 
arsenal ?<P>
<H4><A NAME=h_acquiring_and_converting_civil_plut> </A> 
</H4>
<H4>	Acquiring and Converting Civil Plutonium</H4>
	If a  country has either research and/or power nuclear reactors and a spent fuel reprocessing 
facility, then it has both the source and means of extracting plutonium.  Providing, it is able to 
dodge around  the IAEA surveillance and monitoring of 'safeguarded' installations then with 
ingenuity, but at considerable trouble, inconvenience and  expense, it should be able to manage 
the fuel cycle to produce high quality, weapons grade plutonium.<P>
	For a  country that does not have spent fuel cycle facilities but which receives plutonium  from the 
overseas reprocessing of its civil reactor fuel, or as fresh MOX fuel consignments which contain a 
small proportion of plutonium, a number options are available, again dodging IAEA 
surveillance.16  <P>
	To extract the plutonium content of MOX fuel a small scale dissolution plant is required to 
dissolve the fuel, then separate out the uranium/plutonium streams, possibly using ion-exchange 
but more probably by a small reprocessing-like plant, and then oxide-to-metal conversion. At the 
current levels of plutonium content,17 3 to 4 tonnes of MOX fuel would have to be processed in 
this way to provide sufficient plutonium to reduce to  metal for a single, relatively advanced 
nuclear warhead. Of the uranium split from the MOX fuel, further separation of the U235 and U238 
would require passing the blend through an enrichment plant, although at LWR fuel enrichment 
levels of 2% to 3.5% U235, this might not be considered worthwhile.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	The recovery and conversion of plutonium oxide is relatively straightforward, requiring a oxide-
to- metal conversion plant11 which, with high efficiency, would recover metal from the oxide, 
roughly, on a weight for weight basis.<P>
	<U>Use of Plutonium Recovered from MOX or Pu Returns</U>18<P>
	Assuming the recovered plutonium has an unacceptably high  Pu240 content,  then a technically 
advanced country might develop and deploy laser separation to purify (isotopic isolation) the 
recovered plutonium. In the absence of laser separation facilities, lower grade plutonium metal 
might be deployed in a composite fissile pit with a primary core of enriched uranium, arranged to 
inhibit pre- detonation.<P>
	So, in summary, the acquisition and conversion of plutonium from MOX or overseas 
reprocessing fuel returns, albeit likely to be a lower 'reactor grade' quality, could be recovered and 
converted within a reasonably well equipped civil nuclear fuel cycle plant.  However, successfully 
deploying  lower quality plutonium in a reasonably high yield (a few kilotons) nuclear warhead 
demands that a  number of technical hurdles be overcome.  In effect, a country developing such a 
warhead would have to advance both warhead pit and conventional high explosive technologies 
beyond that presently  achieved by the established nuclear weapons nations over their five decades 
of intensive development;  such a warhead would be large, requiring a parallel programme of 
development for its delivery system; and it would be unproven, most probably unreliable,  so full 
scale nuclear testing of a prototype would be essential.<P>

		<P>
		Example 2:	United States provided Iran with a 5MW research reactor in 1967,  but not 
believed to possess reprocessing capability, although concern recently expressed by United

		Predominantly, fuel core charge for civil nuclear power station reactors at natural (0.7% U235)

In earlier Magnox type of reactors, natural uranium in the base metal form as a single rod

moulding.  The brisance of modern HE lenses has not particularly advanced since the 1950-
60s (for example, TNT at a detonation velocity of about 6,600m/s and energy of 4,500J/g 
compares to current Triaminotrinitrobenzene of 8,000m/s and 5,200J/g), so the fission stage 
can be achieved with moderately advanced explosives.  However, there are considerable 
advantages in deploying high brisance explosives, particularly in thwarting pre- detonation  if 
Pu240 contaminated plutonium is used in the fissile pit, and a chemical composition 
minimising neutron absorbers is preferable.<P>

<H4>	Tritium-Deuterium</H4>
	Tritium (H-3) and Deuterium (heavy water).<P>
		<U>Military Use</U><P>
		<P>
		Combined, tritium and deuterium fusion boosting the fission trigger (also used as kindling in 
the thermonuclear blankets).  <P>
		<P>
		Deuterium used in a number of plutonium breeding reactors in the United States and UK 
during early years of nuclear weapons programmes. Combined with lithium as lithium-
deuteride, used as fusion fuel in thermonuclear warheads.<P>
<p>


		 <P>
		<U>Civil Use</U> <P>
		<P>
		Tritium has extensive application  in industry and laboratories, for offshore oil and gas field 
monitoring, forensic analysis and for self- illuminated signs, etc. - UK 'trimphone' (1970s) 
utilised self-illuminated dial containing tritium, now withdrawn but collected scrap telephones 
now considered to be radioactive waste.<P>
		<P>
		Deuterium as a moderator for civil power and research reactors, notably CANDU type power 
and R&amp D reactors.<P>
		 <P>
		<U>Availability</U><P>
		Generally, both tritium and deuterium restricted. <P>
		<P>
		Tritium is a by-product of nuclear reactor processes but difficult to isolate in the purity and 
concentrations required.  <P>
		<P>
		Deuterium is deployed in large quantities in heavy water moderated reactors (eg CANDU), so 
small quantities readily diverted.  <P>
		 <P>
			Example:	Alleged that Israel and South Africa<P>
			swapped tritium for uranium in late 1970s-80s in mutual support of nuclear weapons 
programmes.<P>
		<P>
		<U>Means of Production</U><P>
		<P>
		Tritium: Irradiation of lithium  capsules in a high pressure loop of a nuclear reactor, also 
generated by  neutron accelerator targeting of lithium in radio-isotope industry. <P>
		<P>
		Deuterium:  Naturally occurring at about 0.015% in water, the extracted deuterium oxide is 
electrolytically decomposed to yield deuterium gas.<P>
		<P>
			Example 1:  India operates a production plant at Nangol to provide heavy water for the 
Cirus reactor which is likely to include a cryogenic distillation plant to separate tritium 
from deuterium.<P>
<p>


			<P>
			Example 2: Israel believed to produce tritium in restarted IRR2 research reactor or 
similar.<P>
			<P>
			Example 3:	Pakistan believed to have tritium stripping facility at CANDU reactor 
facility.<P>
			<P>
			Example 4:	Other non-weapons countries that operate heavy water plants include 
 Argentina, Canada and Norway.	<P>
			<P>
	<U>	Advantages</U><P>
		<P>
		Tritium-Deuterium maximises yield (can also be used to select yield) and reliability of A-
trigger stage<P>
		 <P>
		<U>Disadvantages</U><P>
		<P>
		Tritium difficult to contain at the high pressures required for nuclear warhead applications, 
can cause embrittlement of capsule.   12.3 year half- live results in relatively rapid decay, 
reducing stockpile life of warhead before refurbishing is required.  Has caused difficulties in 
disassembly of stockpile nuclear warheads.<P>
		<P>
		<U>Surveillance</U><P>
		<P>
		Military tritium production reactor discharges can be disguised alongside tritium  discharges 
from civil nuclear power plant. Small quantities involved for nuclear warheads give rise to 
difficulties in both accountancy and detection  tritium and deuterium.<P>

hollowed-out control rods of the IAEA inspected research reactor at Rawalpindi.<P>

	APPENDIX I provides an outline list of the civil nuclear power and research facilities 
operated by various countries world-wide.  The list is not exhaustive, nor is it implied that any of 
these countries diverts the use of these facilities to military application, although the list does 
indicate what key facilities are in place for dual capable transfers to a military programme, that is, if 
there was intent to pursue the military option.<P>

<H3><A NAME=h_iaea_safeguards__technical_supervis> </A> </H3>
<H3>	IAEA Safeguards - Technical Supervision of 
the NPT</H3>
	A good indicator of the capability of a country to proceed along the nuclear warhead development 
route,  that is if it has the intent, is the size and diversity of its  activities in the civil nuclear power 
and research fields.  Of course not all  countries that develop their civil nuclear industry do so to 
acquire nuclear  weapons capability, but the direction and scale of the nuclear activity can indicate 
the potential for such development. Also, some countries simply do not declare nuclear plants that 
are dedicated to military production. <P>
	A sample of countries with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared and 
undeclared nuclear facilities is given in <B>APPENDIX I</B>, although not all of the countries 
listed have been or are full signatories of the NPT.  Of these countries, India has already 
detonated a 'peaceful' nuclear device so must be assumed to retain the capacity; South Africa 
admitted that it had constructed six deployable nuclear warheads but subsequently dismantled 
these; Iraq was accused of developing a nuclear warhead programme to a relatively advanced 
state; North Korea has been accused of preparing nuclear materials for nuclear weapons; and, 
generally it is acknowledged that Israel, who neither confirms nor denies, has succeeded in 
building a nuclear arsenal.   <P>
<p>


	<P>
	The underlying trend of change illustrated by <B>APPENDIX I</B> is that the number of 
individual countries that have, or are about to, reach independence in civil nuclear power has 
dramatically increased in recent years. A second feature hinted at, is that certain countries have 
pooled resources, including the exchange of materials and knowledge, in order to complement 
their civil nuclear industries. In line with this, it is alleged although not confirmed by either 
country, that Israel and South Africa exchanged nuclear materials directly for development of 
their respective nuclear warhead programmes.<P>
	These changes have introduced difficulties for and compromised the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's (IAEA) dual role of, on one hand, policing non- proliferation of nuclear weapons 
technology and materials and, on the other hand, encouraging the peaceful use of nuclear power.  
Maintaining the former role becomes  more demanding as  civil nuclear power plants advance, 
with the key technologies of nuclear power and nuclear munitions overlapping and becoming 
increasingly entwined.<P>
	The IAEA undertakes its function of maintaining the non-proliferation safeguards by monitoring 
the use and transfer of  materials within and from nuclear installations - the keystone to this 
IAEA safeguard system is to control the availability and use of  fissile materials, namely highly 
enriched uranium and plutonium.  This requires the IAEA to have access to all parts of the 
nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining through to the production and post irradiation 
management of nuclear fuel, including monitoring of radioactive discharges and wastes.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	For effectiveness, this system requires that virtually all nuclear installations within any single 
state must be within the IAEA monitoring system - these monitored installations are referred to as 
'safeguarded'.  However, a number of states operate key installations that are 'unsafeguarded' and 
not open to IAEA monitoring; and certain states remain outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty for 
which signatory states accept (or pledge) that all nuclear installations might be considered to be 
safeguarded.<P>
	Even for safeguarded plants, particularly uranium enrichment plants, the material throughput 
tonnages are so great that the quantities required to support  a moderate nuclear warhead 
programme might be readily diverted undetected.  In irradiated fuel reprocessing for plutonium 
extraction, which is completed in batches each taking a few days to  process, not only does the 
reprocessing plant have to be continuously monitored but, also, the fuel core inventories of all of 
the supporting reactors (declared or otherwise) have to be logged on a very frequent basis.<P>
	If the conviction exists, an individual country can play a cat-and-mouse game within rules and 
safeguards of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The country can advance its own civil nuclear power 
technology without constraint; it can establish independence for its own nuclear fuel supplies, 
including enrichment of uranium stocks and reprocessing of irradiated fuel; it can receive 
overseas technological assistance for civil nuclear projects; and it can conduct research and 
development in advanced nuclear techniques and processes, including fusion.  In other words, a 
determined country can acquire the processes, physical facilities, technological know-how and 
fissile materials required for nuclear munitions by proceeding along a quite legitimate civil 
nuclear power development route.  Since the fundamental requirements of civil nuclear power 
and nuclear munitions share a great deal in common, an advanced civil nuclear power 
programme must have, by its very nature, a dual capability.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	On its part, the IAEA can only inspect and monitor.  It has to ensure that it has full access to all 
plants that might be involved, it has to physically measure and account all materials involved, 
wherever these might be located.  In monitoring radioactive wastes and discharges from 
operational plants, it has to distinguish between quite legitimate civil and possible clandestine 
military applications, a differentiation which is now becoming increasingly more difficult as the 
two technologies merge.<P>
	As the earlier example of the United Kingdom  demonstrated, an effective way to develop a 
nuclear weapons arsenal is to direct the civil nuclear power programme to the military needs - 
South Africa built its now dismantled weapons arsenal employing much the same duplicity.  It 
follows, therefore, that if world-wide nuclear weapons proliferation is to be halted, the civil 
nuclear power industries have to be rigorously controlled and, if this is not practicable, then these 
facilities have to be dismantled.<P>

<H2>				APPENDIX II</H2>
<H2>Nuclear Warheads - Materials Utilised</H2>
A nuclear warhead may assume the form of either an atomic <U>fission</U> device, that is the atomic or A-Bomb, or a hydrogen <U>fusion</U> device, the thermonuclear or H-Bomb, which includes a fission stage A-Bomb.<P>
<U>A-Bomb Fissile Material</U>  Pu239/U235<P>
The fission warhead achieves nuclear detonation by either firing together (a gun type) or uniformly compressing (implosion type) a core of fissile material. This fissile material will comprise either highly enriched uranium (U235) or, more likely, a core 
of plutonium metal (Pu239).19  In some warhead designs a 
combination of  U235 and Pu239 is used.  The quantities of fissile materials deployed varies with the design, for a Pu239 fissile pit about 3 to 5kg is required, for a U235 device about 15 to 25kg and for a fissile pit using a combination of U235 and Pu23
9 smaller quantities of both fissile materials (~2.8kg Pu and 
around 5- 7kg U235) are required.<P>
<U>Conventional High Explosive Lenses</U><P>
Until the moment of nuclear detonation the fissile core is held in a sub-critical spatial arrangement.  In the more common implosion design of warhead, to initiate nuclear detonation, conventional explosive charges or lenses are fired to violently compres
s the fissile mass sphere to a super-critical arrangement 
at which neutrons are internally generated, causing fission and a rapidly escalating chain reaction by generation of more neutrons.  During the full compression process the density of the fissile material increases about 10 to 25 times over its original c
omponent assembly density.<P>
The HE lenses are manufactured by moulding segments of fast and slow explosives to generate a shaped explosive front.  Depending on the warhead design, between 20 and 50 lenses may be used to completely enclose the fissile pit.<P>
 <P>
<U>Other Materials</U><P>
A number of 'tricks' involving engineering and physics are required to ensure that this process occurs sequentially, very rapidly and successfully. <P>
<p>


<P>
First, the high explosive lenses act on a 'tamper' shell of <U>beryllium</U> and/or <U>depleted uranium</U> U238 in which the fissile mass, the form of a hollow sphere, is suspended or 'levitated'.  The explosive shock  liquefies the tamper, driving the v
ery strong explosive pressure front inwards to compress 
the fissile mass. <P>
Secondly, as the fissile mass compresses,  beams of neutrons are fired into the fissile pit from an array of <U>neutron generators</U> (high voltage vacuum tubes), providing an abundance of neutrons to accelerate the onset of critical reaction in the fiss
ile mass.  <P>
Thirdly, the very high pressure and temperature generated by the fission process creates hydrogen fusion in the 'booster' charge of the <U>tritium-deuterium</U> filled capsule within the fissile mass sphere.20  The vaporised beryllium tamper is, at this t
ime (just ten-millionths of a second into the nuclear 
sequence), held as a standing shock front which serves to reflect and generate more neutrons into the fissile core.<P>
For a Pu239 hollow sphere of about 85mm diameter (~5kg), the fissioning process releases enough energy to raise the temperature and pressure to about 10.106 to 100.106 (million) oC and 100 million atmospheres within the atomic trigger - this is equivalent

explosive being released virtually instantaneously.<P>
<U>H-Bomb Fusion Materials</U><P>
Fission splits heavy atoms, in doing so liberates energy and additional neutrons to accelerate the process.  The fusion or joining together of small, light nuclei into heavier atoms, also liberates energy but this can only be achieved at very high tempera
ture and pressure.  The atomic or A-bomb trigger creates 
these conditions for a sequenced fusion process.  <P>
The fusion stage comprises cylindrical blankets of fusion fuel of <U>lithium 6-deuteride</U>,21 encased within an outer wrap or mantle of <U>depleted uranium</U> (U238).  In some warhead designs, the fusion fuel is in the form of a second series of sphere
s wrapping the fission trigger.<P>
<p>


<P>
In the cylindrical design, some of the  fissioning energy from the trigger is channelled down a tube or '<U>spark plug</U>' fabricated of Pu239 or U235 - in advanced designs, particularly for multi-staged fusion devices, the spark plug is encased in a '<U
>pusher</U>' of U238 or U235.  Another component of this 
energy is focused, via a <U>paper/resin</U> honeycomb lens, to the very dense <U>polystyrene</U> wrap that encloses the fusion blankets. The plasma created in the polystyrene wrap radially compresses the fusion fuel and inner spark plug tube and its pushe
r, both fissioning, creates conditions to convert 
the lithium-6 fusion fuel component into <U>tritium</U> which then fuses with the deuteride under the intense pressures created by the outer plasma and inner spark plug fissioning.22 Although the fusion process is self- sustaining, more advanced fusion de
signs include micro- encapsulated tritium-deuterium 
(T+D) to kindle the lithium- dueteride reaction via a lithium hydride or beryllium moderator.<P>
Finally, the neutrons released in the fusing of the tritium and deuteride are of sufficient high energy to fission the outer mantle of depleted uranium. <P>
The fission-fusion-fission processes deployed in a thermonuclear warhead can be cascaded by increasing the number of blanket wraps in the fusion-fission stage.  In a single stage fusion design with T+D kindling, if the depleted uranium mantle is omitted t
he high energy fusion neutrons are released to 
produce the so-called 'neutron' bomb.<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>
1	The plutonium used in nuclear warheads is not totally 100% Pu-239 but includes other isotopes of plutonium, including <U>Pu-240</U> and Pu-241.  The plutonium is also alloyed with traces of other metals, usually gallium, to facilitate machining, and inc
ludes traces of other impurities (chiefly 
uranium) which were not removed during reprocessing of the irradiated fuel. Pu-240 is more radioactive than Pu-239 and has a higher critical mass, being fissionable by fast neutrons like all other plutonium isotopes.  Pu-238 is an undesirable inclusion du
e to its high heat generation rate.<P>
	So called 'weapons grade' plutonium normally contains 7% or less Pu-240 at the time of production, essentially no Pu-238 (0.07%), about 92% to 93.5% Pu-239, and about 0.5% to 0.7% Pu241.  The short half-life of Pu-241 (some 13.5 years) means that stockpi
les plutonium will develop a 
significant amount of Americium-241 (from Pu-241 decay), so that typically a 13-year old plutonium source (which is roughly the age of the plutonium in US and UK warheads) the proportion of plutonium and americium will be approximately 0.07% Pu-238, 6% Pu
-240, 0.35% Pu-241, 0.35% Am-
241 and the remainder Pu-239.  The radioactivity of such 'aged' weapons grade plutonium is 0.09Ci/g or 11.1 g/Ci, about x1.47 more hazardous to health than pure Pu239 and about one-quarter as hazardous as 'reactor grade' plutonium.<P>
	The quality of the plutonium for nuclear warheads is important but not vital.  In the mid-1960s the United States developed and successfully tested a plutonium warhead in which relatively impure (> 7% Pu-240) reactor grade plutonium was utilised - this p
lutonium was extracted from fuel 
irradiated in Britain's civil Magnox nuclear power stations, which suggests that the Pu-240 content was no more than 12% if the then current commercial power station burn-fuel was the source of the plutonium.<P>
2	Initially, Britain's plutonium was produced in the two Windscale atomic  piles(graphite moderated, air-cooled low temperature reactors) which operated from 1952 but which were abruptly closed down in 1957 following the Windscale Fire.  The plutonium pro
duction was transferred to the four 
Magnox reactors at Calder Hall (also at Windscale) but to meet increasing demand for plutonium, a series of Magnox civil power stations were specified in the late 1950s and brought into operation from 1962 at Bradwell, Berkeley, Hinkley Point, Dungeness, 
Hunterston and Trawsfynydd, in 
addition to another four dedicated military plutonium Magnox reactors at Chapelcross, commissioned in 1959.  It has been acknowledged that plutonium recovered from the irradiated fuel of the civil power stations supplemented the military or 'unsafeguarded
' plutonium stockpile certainly through 
the 1960s and, possibly, into the early 1970s.<P>
<p>


<P>
	In fact the roots of Britain's nuclear industry, much like that of France, stem from and have been very much determined by its nuclear military needs.  The UK nuclear industry centred around plutonium breeding and reprocessing and, to offset the enormous
 cost of reprocessing, it has vigorously 
sought overseas fuel contracts for its reprocessing plants.  In fact, the currently operational Magnox reprocessing plant at Sellafield (Windscale) is openly acknowledged to be a dual capable plant, reprocessing batches of 'civil' power station irradiated
 fuel in parallel to short-burn irradiated fuel from 
the Calder Hall and Chapelcross reactors which are dedicated to plutonium production.  <P>
	For the declared nuclear weapons states, all of this early development effort  resulted in a nuclear industrial infrastructure that was readily detectable.  These states, like Britain, had to establish and prove then new technologies, committing sizeable
 fractions of scientific and technical personnel, 
material and economic resources across the diverse areas of 'factories', research and development, and higher education establishments.13<P>
3	This is, of course, a somewhat over simplified statement since there are a number of considerable technical hurdles to be overcome.  For example, the high explosive lens materials require considerable refinement, moving away for the neutron absorbing hi
ghly hydronated and nitrogen based 
explosives since these are effective neutron absorbers which would inhibit the fissile stage; the timing of the neutron injection is absolutely critical, requiring arrival at the compressing  fissile mass just when it has reached supercriticality; and, fo
r a thermonuclear device, there are some very 
significant synchronising problems to be mastered in progressing the 'spark plug' fissioning at a rate to match the fusioning of the lithium-deuteride charges.<P>
<p>


	<P>
4	This refers to the South Indian Ocean double flash of September 1979, believed to be, but subsequently denied, a joint test venture between Israel and South Africa. <P>
5	India detonated a 12kt 'peaceful' nuclear device in the Rajasthan desert in 1974.<P>
6	The first atomic or A-bomb was detonated  in July, 1945 by the United States in Nevada as a precursor to the Nagasaki bomb of August, 1945. The first thermonuclear or H-bomb configured device was detonated in November, 1952   on the Marshall Islands, ag
ain by the United States.  For the 
Hiroshima A-bomb, the United States did not nuclear test the design.<P>
	Over the last  two decades the importance of nuclear weapons testing has diminished.  This is because advances in computer modelling, so- called cold testing of the non-nuclear components, and techniques enabling  small scale fission and, particularly, f
usion processes to be undertaken separately in 
reasonably advanced laboratory facilities.  This is reflected by the decline in the rate of testing by the declared nuclear weapons states (US, Russia, etc), who now tend to use testing for yield predictions, to ratify design changes and, more generally, 
to improve their understanding of the physical 
processes involved so that benchmark and cold testing may be completed more reliably. There is also a need to demonstrate the nuclear hardness of military equipment and for the nuclear weapons themselves when deployed in a nuclear battlefield environment.
<P>
		<P>
7	All of these uranium enrichment techniques rely of the physical fact that the<P>
	velocities of molecules of different mass differ and that, the minuscule different between U-235 and U- 238, gives the U-235 a slightly higher velocity, kinetic energy and, hence, pressure - this is used to differentiate and separate molecules either by 
diffusing these through a membrane (diffusion), 
skimming the outer layer of a rapidly rotating mix (centrifuge and vortex), or by targeting the higher velocity molecules of a distended jet (jet and Calutron).  Since the enrichment gain produced by a single separation is very slight, a very large number
 of separations (hundreds and thousands with, as 
a result, enrichment plants covering the area taken up by a dozen or so football pitches) are necessary for substantial enrichment.  This requires the separator stages to be cascaded with, at each separator, about one half the feed gas passing through, no
w slightly enriched, to be passed to the next 
higher stage for a repetition of the cycle. The gas that does not pass through, slightly depleted, is returned to the previous  lower stage for repetition.  At  each cascade of stages, compressors and heat exchangers are stationed to maintain the temperat
ure and pressure conditions required, these are 
energy intensive processes.<P>
<p>


	<P>
8	During the staging a small proportion the feedstock undergoes hydrolysis to form a solid uranyl fluoride compound, which depletes the enrichment, and, similarly, the some of the uranium hexafluoride converts to uranium pentafluoride (by loss of an atom 
of fluorine), again depleting the enrichment 
particularly in the  higher level stages. Also, a small amount of adsorption involving the deposit of uranium hexafluoride on the surfaces of the vessels and interconnecting piping occurs, which although small per unit are, totally it is a significant los
s since the thousands of stages making up the plant 
represent many square kilometres of exposed surfaces.<P>
9	There are two means of expediting uranium enrichment, these are 'stretching' and 'recycling', both of which break down the normally continuous process into batches.  In stretching the cascade flow is 'blocked' by lowering the differential pressure over 
the stage, this increases the enrichment level of 
each stage but reduces the flow rate, thus lengthening the overall processing cycle time to obtain very small amount so of enriched product.  In recycling, the outputs of several  cascades are reintroduced  as feed to a single cascade, again this is time 
consuming and can create criticality problems.<P>
10	In reactors that are designed for power generation and  plutonium breeding, the core may be  divided into two regions, an inner fuelled power section and an outer blanket which contains the fertile material - some research reactors utilising enriched u
ranium fuel cores are configured in this way.  
Neutrons produced by fission diffuse into the blanket and are captured by the fertile U- 238 to produce Pu-239 which can be extracted or further fissioned in-situ if required.  Neutron capture in the moderator, structural core materials and leakage from t
he core has to be reduced to a minimum to 
maintain a high breeding ratio. Graphite and heavy water moderated cores have a low capture cross section, so neutron absorption is low, whereas water (light) moderation (as in a PWR) has a high capture cross section reducing the breeding ratio which, wit
h the difficulties of arranging on-load 
refuelling for PWRs, further detracts from the use of PWR and BWR designs for the dual capable role.<P>
11	Metal finishing of plutonium involves a number of processes, including precipitating plutonium peroxide and conversion to plutonium tetrafluoride by anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, calcium and iodine added for reduction to metal buttons which are pickled 
in a dilute nitric acid to remove slag and 
these are cast into gallium alloyed ingots by gravity or pre-machining shapes (hemispheres) in rapidly rotating moulds, thereafter the final pit component (two hemispheres) are precisely machined by cutting, bead blasting and/or electrolytic reduction to 
the final components which are surface plated 
to inhibit oxidation.<P>
12	It is also theoretically possible to produce  fissile detonation using U-233. A number of US nuclear tipped artillery shells were considered for this material in the 1950s, although these never seemed to have been developed to service deployed munition
s.<P>
13	During the early phase of its nuclear weapon development programme the United Kingdom engaged a number of private companies for specialised aspects, these included:<P>
		Hunting Engineering with the case design<P>
		<P>
		EMI for the firing and safety circuits, electrical generators, etc - similarly, Langham Thompson for these components for parallel bomb development marks -  Hunting Percivals Aircraft Co and Southern Instruments Ltd<P>
<p>


		<P>
		Elliot Bros for the radar trip, barometric and impact switches<P>
		<P>
	Wayne Kerr, GEC and DFM developed and manufactured the trigatron (the firing activation)<P>
	and, it is believed,<P>
	ICI were involved in the tuballoy and oralloy (Uranium components) and HE lenses.<P>
		<P>
	During the nuclear detonation tests academics from Oxford and Cambridge Universities were involved.<P>
14	The isotopic content of plutonium blended in MOX fuel is a sensitive topic, although it would be expected that the Pu-240 content would be low because of its high spontaneous fissioning rate.  If, as mooted, salvaged plutonium from dismantled nuclear w
eapons is burnt in MOX fuel, the quality 
would be high since so-called 'denatured' plutonium (introducing the undesirable plutonium isotopes) seems to be neither a practical or economic proposition.<P>
15	In a uranium fuelled reactor some neutrons, as many as 30 to 40% of those produced by fissioning U-235, are captured in U-238 and produce U-239.  This is the start of the radioactive decay chain that yields plutonium:<P>
	238U+n  239U -/23m  239Np -/2,3d  239Pu /24,300y<P>
	In a reactor containing a large amount of fertile material, that is a natural or slightly enriched uranium reactor, the creation of the new fissile material Pu-239 offsets the burn-up of the original fuel.  For plutonium production the important processe
s are, starting with the abbreviated decay chain 
above:<P>
	235U+n  238U + fission<P>
	238U+n  239U  239Np  239Pu<P>
		<P>
	but then a proportion of the created plutonium fissile isotope reacts then the following event occur:<P>
<p>


	<P>
	239Pu+n  240Pu + fission<P>
	240Pu+n  241Pu<P>
	 <P>
	241Pu+n  242Pu + fission<P>
	This interplay between the uranium isotopes and fissioning of the plutonium produces an exponential relationship in the decay and growth of U-235 and Pu-239 respectively in the reactor core over time. Essentially, the Pu-239 reaches a saturation content 
whilst the U-235 continues to decrease until 
a level at which the reactor requires refuelling to maintain criticality. The number of fissions occurring in the reactor can be measured indirectly by the heat output of the reactor, appropriately modified for the position of the fuel in the reactor core
, so plutonium production is given by a conversion 
ratio, such as<P>
	Pugrams/Utons = aEe-bE<P>
	 <P>
	where <B>'a</B>' and <B>'b</B>' are constants and <B>'E</B>' is the fuel irradiation or burn-up in MWday/ton.<P>
	Since the higher plutonium isotopes (240-242) are undesirable for weapons grade plutonium,1 because these absorb neutrons, give rise to pre-detonation and/or are strong gamma emitters, the subsequent fissioning of Pu-239 has to be inhibited by either rem
oving the plutonium yielding fuel (or 
reactor blanket elements) from the reactor at a very low burn-up and/or by limiting the neutron absorption window of the Pu-239 by temperature control of the moderator.  Reactor features that aid weapons grade plutonium production include facilities to re
move short-burn irradiated fuel whilst the 
reactor is on load, where the reactor core is wrapped in a blanket of U-238 fertile charge and/or where the fuel is of natural or low U-235 enrichment, and graphite moderation in which the temperature is relatively low.  Ideal fuel irradiation rates for p
lutonium production are very low, at about 200-
250MWd/t and to limit the shift of thermal neutron spectrum of Pu-239 the outer moderator region temperature is maintained between 150 to 300oC.<P>
<p>


	 	<P>
16	At this time there are no running contracts to return plutonium or provide MOX to the	so-called 'developing' countries.<P>
17	Currently, MOX fuels contain no more than 7% plutonium and MOX fuel should not be greater than one-third of the entire reactor core, so the equivalent plutonium 'enrichment' in a fully integrated MOX fuel core is a little over 3%.<P>
18	There are claims that a  nuclear weapon could be fabricated from MOX fuel oxide, without  reduction to a metal form and need to separate out the U-235/238 components.  The only stipulation being that  the MOX plutonium concentration should exceed 4%. J
ust how a supercritical fissile mass 
could be achieved with such a voluminous and lightly fissile material is obscure and, even if it could, the amount of mixed oxide required would be enormous.<P>
19	Of the two types of nuclear warhead configuration, the fissile material deployed in the 'gun' type is generally limited to enriched U- 235.  This is because the small Pu-240 content of plutonium masses (even the limited fraction in 'weapons grade' plut
onium) precludes its use because of its high 
spontaneous neutron emission rate pre- detonates, destroying the fissile mass geometry before a full fission reaction can occur.  The higher content of Pu-240 in reactor grade plutonium makes a successful Pu gun geometry even more difficult and, indeed, a
pplies quite severe limitations on the upper 
yield of implosion designs utilising reactor grade plutonium.  The United States is believed to have developed small diameter atomic weapons, suited for artillery shell casings, by fashioning the plutonium fissile component as a collapsible tube.<P>
20	Exact timing is crucial for successful tritium-deuterium boosting.  For this, the highly pressurised (about 300b) capsule of D+T is introduced to within the pit after the primary fission reaction has begun, just at the time when conditions are commensu
rate to fusion (almost at the point of maximum pit 
compression) which is determined directly by transducing the number of events and timers occurring in the pit. Another technique of boosting, which is deployed in late Soviet designs, is that the fissile mass void encloses a grid-like structure with a  li
thium- deuteride substrate, providing a fusion fuel 
to be prompted by just tritium injection, thus saving on the quantity of tritium deployed.<P>
<p>


	<P>
	The fusion boosting, and its accompanying neutron initiation, does not directly contribute to the yield, but serves to enhance the primary fissioning for improved yield.<P>
	The tritium-deuterium capsule and external neutron gun source is not the only means of boosting the initial fission reaction and early warhead designs utilised a less effective neutron source in the form of a small, spherical capsule of beryllium-poloniu
m composition.  This device comprised two 
beryllium  spheres (<B><A HREF="fig07.gif">FIGURE 7</A></B>): about a 10mm diameter  outer hollow sphere, machined with a serrated inner surface (formed from four-sided pyramid indents), was plated with a nickel/gold coating.  The nickel/gold plating of t
he  solid inner sphere received an overcoat of polonium kept 
insulated from the beryllium by the nickel/gold substrates, with the two spheres  separated by a series of radial pins projecting inwards from the outer sphere.  When the fissile mass compressed, the shock wave was 'jetted' by the serrations, shattering a
nd mixing the polonium and beryllium for the 
prompt neutron emission.  The short radioactive half-life of polonium (Po-210 ~138 days) required this capsule  to be changed frequently, thus shortening the stockpile life of the warhead.<P>
21	Lithium-6 is deployed in various forms of hydride (lithium-protium, -deuterium and -tritium) to provide the fusion fuel. Lithium-7 can also be used as a fusion (tritium) source with the added advantage of an additional neutron generation. Lithium-hydri
de is also used as a fusion fuel in combination 
with lithium-deuteride.<P>
	In the fusion process, 1kg of lithium-6 has the potential to create about 60kt, that is if all of the lithium converts to tritium and, then, all the tritium fuses with deuterium - in practice, the lithium fuel realises between 10 to 30kt of the yield. <P
>
22	Only the principal fusion reactions 	are referred to in the main text, but <P>
	additional fusion reactions (including tritium-tritium, deuterium-deuterium, helium-deuterium, lithium-deuterium, etc) are also energy liberating.<P>
23	A significant difference in the later designs is that the US favours externally mounted, high voltage neutron generators and tritium- deuterium sources, contrasted to the Soviet design where the generators and tritium boosters are integrated within the
 casing of the warhead.  The internal components 
of <B><A HREF="fig05.gif">FIGURE 5</A></B> mimic the  Soviet design trend.<P>
24	These quantities of materials are the general measures for nuclear warheads, although a rough and ready guide to the actual quantities to produce a set yield can be readily derived.  <P>
	Consider for example a 200kt nuclear device in which it is reasonable to assume that about 50% of the yield derives from the fusion of deuterium and tritium (D+T) atoms and the remainder 100kt from fissioning of the depleted uranium U-238 mantle. 1kt req
uires 1.45.E23 fission events so  1.45E25 
neutrons have to be generated by the fusion process to fission the U-238 mantle.  The energy equivalent of the fusion 100kt is about 0.26E28Mev and each D+T fusion releases 17Mev, so   2E26 fusion events have to occur.  This results in over ten times the 
number of fusions required to completely 
fission the uranium mantle.  For the full fusion of the warhead, the fusion stage requires  320 gram moles of deuterium and tritium, or about 0.7kg deuterium and 1.3kg tritium, or a lithium-deuteride pack of about 4kg to 6kg which is sufficient to fission
 12kg of U-238, but since the fission is unlikely 
to totally complete, about 2 times this amount will be required.  Stepping back to the fission trigger, each D+T reaction requires 0.5Mev so the trigger must produce  1E26 for which  0.6 gram moles about  0.1kg of plutonium needs to completely fission, wh
ich is well within the fission efficiency of 
the atomic trigger stage.<P>
	So, very roughly, the 200kt yield thermonuclear warhead requires the minimum critical mass of plutonium, about 2.5kg, in the atomic trigger stage, 4-6kg lithium-deuteride in the fusion stage, a minimum critical mass of plutonium in the spark plug, say 2.
5kg, and 24-30kg of depleted uranium in 
the mantle, together with a few grams of tritium-deuterium gas for fusion boosting and kindling.  Because the efficiency of the atomic trigger stage is not particularly demanding, there is some benefit in stepping directly to a thermonuclear device as aga
inst developing a highly efficient and fully 
yielding atomic bomb warhead.<P>

<title>GREENPEACE REPORT SHOWS FISH OILS CONTAIN ORGANOCHLORINES</title>
</head>

<H1>COD LIVER OIL CONTAMINATED BY TOXIC CHLORINE  CHEMICALS SAYS
GREENPEACE  
</H1>




<body>



<HR>



<P>LONDON, 7 June 1995--Cod liver oil and other fish oils sold as
health products contain dangerously high levels of toxic 
chlorine chemicals, known as organochlorines, Greenpeace 
revealed in an independent research report released today.    

<P>This research reveals for the first time one of the major
pathways where pollutants are entering the human food chain.
Pollution of the seas by the chlorine industry is now clearly
linked to human health.

<P>Greenpeace scientists have sampled 22 brands of fish oils,  such
as cod liver oil, 17 of which are sold in health food  shops as
dietary supplements.

 or <a href="fish02.jpg">27KB JPG.</a>Commonly used fish oil products. Greenpeace/Warford.

<P>Fish oil samples were obtained from Norway, Japan, Spain, UK, 
Iceland and Germany. Of the 22 sampled, 21 contained high  levels
of hazardous contaminants, namely the organochlorine  pesticides
DDT and lindane and polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs).  

<P>Anyone taking the recommended dose of the worst contaminated  oil
capsules, obtained from Norwegian salmon, would receive 128 times
the UK estimated daily intake of PCBs (as published by the World
Health Organisation).  Anyone taking a therapeutic dose would
reach 80 percent of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
recommended daily maximum consumption for these pollutants.    

<P>These chemicals are entering the sea from rivers and industrial
discharges and run off from contaminated land. The pollutants are
then carried by the atmosphere and oceanic currents to remote
areas of the oceans. The main area where cod liver oil comes from
are the waters of the North Atlantic. Fish pick up the toxic
chemicals through the food chain and  their livers concentrate
the residues.

 or <a href="fish01.jpg">22KB JPG.</a>Who takes cod liver oil?. Greenpeace/Testa.
<P>A report recently released by Greenpeace documented the potential
human health effects of these chemicals which include
infertility, birth defects and altered levels of sex  hormones.
Organochlorine toxins are now known to be accumulating in human
blood, breast milk, muscle and body fat [1].

<P>The Greenpeace research clearly shows a widespread failure by 
governments to prevent contamination of the oceans and to ensure
that contaminated fish oils do not reach the market place. 

<P>There is little regulatory control for organochlorines in food 
in many countries. Yet there is now mounting evidence that even
small intakes of these chemicals by humans can pose a threat to
health. 

<P>"Cod liver oil has long been regarded as being beneficial to  
health," said Greenpeace Scientist Paul Johnston. "But our
research clearly shows that there  is now serious cause for
concern about the contamination of  fish oils with toxic chlorine
chemicals.  There is a real danger that people  who take these
products for medicinal purposes are contributing substantially
to their intake of toxic chemicals."

 or <a href="fish03.jpg">19KB JPG.</a>The familiar capsuleof cod liver oil. Greenpeace/Warford.  
<P>The widespread use of fish oils used by the food industry in 
products such as biscuits and margarine is also another route 
where people will take in these chemicals, said Dr Johnston. Fish
oils are widely used by the European baking industry,  
accounting for two percent of the total world fat and food oil 
production. They are also used in the manufacture of foods  such
as margarine and ice cream.  
   
<P>This week there is a major international conference on the 
protection of the North Sea in Esbjerg, Denmark (2). The meeting
will discuss a Dutch  government proposal to ban the discharge
and production of all  hazardous chemicals within one generation
particularly organochlorines from the sea.
  
<P>This proposal has currently been opposed by a number of
governments including the UK, France, Belgium, Sweden and the 
European Union. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, the
European Chlorine Industry umbrella group, Eurochlor, denies that
the  discharge of toxic chlorine chemicals into the environment
are  harmful, and is aggressively lobbying the North Sea States 
to block the proposal [3].   
   
<P>Greenpeace supports the Dutch proposal to ban the discharge of 
and production of hazardous chemicals and in particular the 
organochlorines. Until an agreement is reached on this the  seas
will continue to be used as toxic dumps by the chlorine  industry
and contamined fish oils will contine to poison  people.

<h1><I><center>De Facto Nuke Dump?</I></center></h1>
<p>
<b>THE THREAT:</b> Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a consortium of
European and American nuclear industries, has plans to build a
uranium enrichment plant between Forest Grove and Center Springs,
two rural, impoverished communities 50 miles from Shreveport.
<p>
<b>TOXIC RADIOACTIVE WASTE WITH NOWHERE TO GO:</b> The proposed plant will
produce over 4,000 tons of radioactive toxic waste annually-adding
up to an estimated 100,000 tons during the plant's thirty year
life.  Some residents fear that the radioactive waste will be
stored on site at the plant because there is no known means of
permanent and safe disposal of this waste.  If LES is permitted to
construct and operate this enrichment plant, Forest Grove and
Center Springs will become de facto toxic dumping grounds for
radioactive waste.
<p>
<b>NO NEED FOR ENRICHED URANIUM:</b> The enriched uranium produced by the
plant is used in civilian nuclear reactors, but there is no need
for another plant to create enriched uranium as there has not been
a proposal for a new reactor in over 15 years.
<p>

ALT="photo of protest"><b>RESPONDING TO THE THREAT:</b> When the citizens of 
Forest Grove and Center Springs learned that they had been targeted to host the 
proposed plant they organized as CANT, (<I>Citizens Against Nuclear 
Trash</I>).  Since 1989, CANT has fought to prevent the construction of 
this dangerous nuclear facility. 
<p>
<h2><i><center>Join the Battle for Environmental Justice!</i></center></h2>
<p>
<b>THE DECISION IS NEAR:</b> In March of 1995, a three judge panel form
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) heard testimony about the nuclear facility
proposed between the African American communities of Forest Grove
and Center Springs, in northern Louisiana.
<p>
Opponents argued that the siting is another example of
environmental racism - a shameful pattern of dumping America's
hazardous wastes in low income communities of color.
<p>
Every legal brief has been filed and the NRC judges are now in the process of making their final
decision on whether or not to grant a license to LES. 
<p>
<i><b>A public hearing on the LES wastewater discharge has been scheduled for January 11th, 
1996 in Homer, Louisiana. If you live close enough to attend, please do.  DON'T LET THE NRC

We have the power to prevent yet another low income community of

<ul>
<li>The uranium enrichment plant proposed by Louisiana Energy

<li>It is totally unnecessary</li>

<li>The siting of this facility between two, low income African-

Greenpeace began on the sea. It earned its first fame by sailing into the US 
atomic test site in the North Pacific and through the fights to save the seals 
and the whales. The sea -- with its vast expanses and murky depths, home of 
leviathan, burial ground for atomic reactors and toxic wastes, its very 
immensity a cloak for the unscrupulous, belonging to everyone but no one, and
so to be seized and used at the will of the mighty -- the deep sea and its 
inhabitants have no neighbours and no witnesses to protest what is happening 
to them.

<p>
The Greenpeace fleet attempts to be that witness and good neighbour, checking 
to see that agreements are observed, to protest and when possible prevent 
destruction of marine life and resources. Greenpeace's eight ships - and some 
30 of the fast and manoeuvrable inflatable dinghies that have proved so 
effective in Greenpeace protest actions - are the organization's unique 
contribution to the environmental movement. The larger ships are all equipped 
with complete satellite communications facilities.

<B>Rainbow Warrior</B></a> was inspired by a North American 
Indian legend which prophesies that when man has destroyed the world through 
his greed, the Warriors of the Rainbow will arise to save it again. The new 
Rainbow Warrior replaces the original sunk by the French secret service in 
1985. The three mast schooner was rebuilt on the hull of the former fishing 
vessel "Grampian Fame", and launched on July 10, 1989, the anniversary of the 
sinking of her predecessor. Equipped with the latest in electronic navigation, 
sailing and communication equipment, she is an oceangoing  vessel intended for 
assignments in the Pacific.

<B>Sirius</B></a> is named for the star Sirius, the 
brightest star in the firmament and a positive potent since ancient times.
The Sirius was built to naval specifications at "Boele" shipyard in the 
Netherlands in 1950 as one of 7 pilot vessels. In early May of 1981, the ship 
was dry-docked in Scheveningen, where a handful of volunteers  cleaned the 
hull below the waterline and applied fresh coats of anti-fouling paint. The 
following week, in Amsterdam, the former pilot ship began to be transformed 
into a Greenpeace vessel. The former owners - the Royal Dutch Navy - had 
maintained the ship well and the engine room appeared to be in good condition, 
but getting the ship ready for her first campaign in just 10 weeks was a 
haunting task. During this period volunteers of all ages and from many 
countries came on board for a few days or a few weeks to help out. The ship's 
colour scheme was soon changed to a green hull and rainbow colours and a white 
dove of peace with an olive branch was painted on the bow. Many companies and 
suppliers contributed their advice and goodwill to help the transformation 
take place. The galley was equipped; additional navigation and communication 
equipment was installed on the bridge; and inflatables, life rafts and fire- 
extinguishers were put in place. One of the pantries was transformed into an 
outboard-engine workshop; the forward mess room was changed into a store-room 
for campaign equipment and inflatables, when not in use; and the wash room 
midships was made into a fresh food store. On July 13, the Sirius left the 
berth in Amsterdam and the volunteers, who had made the maiden voyage possible, 
wished it 'bon voyage' at the locks to the North Sea. In 1985 the aft 
mast was removed  and the hydraulic system renovated, so that the old cranes 
could be scrapped and replaced by one new one. In 1986, to prepare the ship 
for a long campaign in the Mediterranean, the midships food stores were 
changed into a chill room, a satellite communications system was purchased and 
the small mess room was converted into a campaign  office with a computer. 
Since that time the vessel has operated almost continuously in the 
Mediterranean, with occasional campaigns in the North Sea.
Over the course of the years, the engine room wasn't forgotten: apart from 
normal maintenance and upgrading, the old auxiliary engines were replaced by 
new ones and an oily-water-separator and  sewage treating plant were installed. 
Since starting with Greenpeace in 1981, the Sirius has built up its own 
reputation as an action and information ship. It is well known all from 
Iceland to Italy. Even the Soviet harbour of Leningrad had the pleasure of a 
visit.

<B>MV Greenpeace</B></a>, a Dutch-built former deep sea salvage tug, was 
bought by Greenpeace in 1985. Built in 1959, 58 metres long, 905 tons 
and with 32 berths, the vessel was strengthened against ice and equipped with a 
helicopter pad and satellite communications system in preparation for the 
Antarctic expedition.  A veteran of three voyages to the Antarctic and
disablement through ramming by US Navy ships while protesting the Trident 
missile program in 1989, the Greenpeace now sails primarily in the North 
Atlantic.
<p>
The MV Greenpeace was originally build as an ocean-going tug and salvage 
vessel, owned and operated by Smit Internationale in the Netherlands. In 1977, 
Smit sold the ship to the Association of Maryland Pilots in the USA; it was 
converted from a tugboat in Verolme dockyard, Cork, Ireland, newly equipped 
and provided with additional accommodation. It operated as a Pilot Station 
vessel in Maryland, USA until 1985. When the Association of Maryland Pilots 
became an ashore-based operation and no longer needed the ship, Greenpeace 
acquired it. At this time Greenpeace was planning an expedition to the 
Antarctic to establish a base camp and have the continent declared a "World 
Park" to preserve it from exploitation.  In May the MV Greenpeace sailed to 
London for a press conference on the campaign and then on to the Amsterdam 
shipyard. In consultation with a naval architect and after research into the 
conditions,the ship might meet in the Ross Sea by Antarctica, the hull was ice 
strengthened and the ship was refitted and equipped for polar conditions. The 
deck was rearranged to allow for more storage space above as well as below 
decks and was fitted with hatches, lifting beams and a crane. Satellite 
communications and sophisticated communication and navigational aids were 
added. 
<p>
In 1986, a 
<a href="chopper.jpg">
<img width=110 height=58 border=0 src="chopprbw.gif" alt=" ">helicopter</a>
 pad was built in New Zealand. The ship has been 
continually upgraded since and has completed 3 voyages to the Antarctic. 
Further campaigns of the MV Greenpeace include some of Greenpeace's most 
successful and daring. In late 1989 the ship was rammed by the US Navy, while 
protesting the test firing of Trident missiles on the high seas. Perilously 
damaged, with a large hole just above the waterline, the ship nevertheless 
made it to port and crossed the Atlantic for permanent repairs in Hamburg. In 
October 1990 the MV Greenpeace sailed to Novaya Zemlya, the nuclear test 
island north of the USSR, where it successfully set four activists on the top 
secret test site for 10 hours, where they measured radioactivity. Though 
boarded by armed KGB agents, who destroyed its communications equipment, the 
ship and crew were quickly released. In 1991 the Greenpeace to the Arabian 
Gulf to conduct measurements of environmental damage caused by the Gulf War. 
She departed Singapore in November for the Antarctic whaling grounds.  This 
very successful action was the longest voyage ever attempted by a Greenpeace 
ship.  
After a nine month lay-up in Fremantle, Australia, the Greenpeace departed in 
November 1992 for the Antarctic in support of a campaign to have a whale 
sanctuary declared in the Southern Ocean. She returned to New Zealand in March, 
1993. After  refitting the mv Greenpeace went left New Zealand for a tour 
around SE Asia and Russia, followed by campaigns in Alaska, the West Coast of 
the USA and on via the Panama Canal to Central America, the Amazone River and 
Argentinia. The end of 1994 the MV Greenpeace went once again into the 
Antarctic waters for the Whaling Campaign.
In June 1995 the mv Greenpeace arrived in the Mediterranean.

<B>Solo</B></a>, a 8,600-horsepower Dutch tugboat built in 1977, was 
purchased in 1990 . Greenpeace refitted her with a helicopter deck, an animal 
hospital, a laboratory, a darkroom and an exhibition room. The initial task of 
the Solo was to perform a watchdog position in the North Sea, one of the 
busiest seas on the globe. Over the years the Solo got more and more involved 
with other campaigns both inside the North Sea as outside. Campaigns to Nova 
Zemblaya against radioactive dumping, and to Japan against  Nuclair Wast Trade, 
changed the Solo's original assignment.

<li><a name="Moby"> </a>
<a href="moby.html">
<img width=110 height=61 border=0 src="mobybw.gif" alt=" ">
<B>Moby Dick</B></a> was built in the Netherlands in 1959 and spent 27 
years as a fishing vessel before joining Greenpeace. Greenpeace bought her in 
1986. In just two weeks Greenpeace converted the ship to a Greenpeace ship. 
The trawler winch was removed, additional berths were put in up forward, the 
fish-hold was re-ballasted, communication equipment was installed and cradles 
were welded on deck to carry the indispensable Greenpeace inflatable dinghies. 
With a fresh coat of green paint on the hull, the rainbow and white whale on 
the bow, the Moby Dick left Hamburg for its first campaign on 31 May 1986. 
Moby Dick operates mainly in the North Sea and  in the Baltic although she 
also spend a long time in the USA, campaigning on the Great Lakes, the 
Mississippi and in the Gulf of Mexico.

<p><li><a name="Beluga"> </a>
<a href="beluga.html">
<img width=110 height=78 border=0 src="belugabw.gif" alt=" "> 
<B>Beluga</B></a>, a 
river ship, is named for the small white whales that 
used to appear in European rivers before pollution. The Beluga was built in 
1960 and purchased from the city of Bremen in 1984. 
Greenpeace workers and some 40 volunteers spent over 10,000  hours converting 
the former in-shore fire-fighting patrol boat into a laboratory ship for work 
in rivers, estuaries, harbours and coastal waters. 
They removed service pipes and fire-fighting apparatus and strengthened the 
aft part of the cabin so that the deck can support a rigid-hull inflatable. 
They built in a hydraulic crane to lift the inflatable in and out of the water 
and made improvements in the ship's communications and steerage systems. Twin 
propellers make the ship particularly manoeuvrable and ideally suited for 
river work.
The mess area for the crew doubles as a reception room where the press and 
public are informed about protest actions and research.
Her territory has been the Rhine, Elbe, Schelde, Weser, Thames, Humber, Tyne, 
Tees, Mersey, Meuse, and Seine rivers; the Westerschelde and the Waddensee; 
the coasts of England, Sweden, and Denmark; the Great Lakes and the 
Mississippi.
The Beluga, being an inshore vessel, is usually berthed overnight. Only on 
rare occasions, like crossing the North Sea, will it sail all night. In heavy 
weather the Beluga stays in rivers and canals or in port.

<p><li><a name="Vega"> </a>
<a href="vega.html">
<img width=59 height=110 border=0 src="vegabw.gif" alt=" "> 
<B>Vega</B></a> is the ship that has been with Greenpeace the longest.  
Vega is a 38-foot ketch built in 1948 in Whangarei, New Zealand. Alan Orams,
one of New Zealand's finest boat builders,constructed the yacht without the 
aid of any power tools entirely of native timbers. Vega is a very strong, 
seaworthy yacht, a classic "blue water cruiser," with an 11' 9" beam and a 
6'6" draft. It's design  is derived from a Colin Archer Norwegian Pilot Cutter. 
With large  diesel fuel and water tanks and plenty of storage space,  it  can 
cross any of the world's oceans. In trips to Mururoa, circumnavigation of 
Australia, Pacific Peace voyage and involvement in the North Pacific 
whaling campaigns,  Vega covered  over 50,000 sea miles for peace and the 
environment.
The Vega was purchased by David Mc Taggart, former Chairman of  Greenpeace 
International, in 1969, before he became involved in Greenpeace. Vega was 
later sold and remained privately owned until 1981 when Greenpeace repurchased 
it and prepared to sail to Mururoa.
Recently the boat has been handed over to David McTaggart, upon his resignation. 
Vega will be based in the Mediterranean, and is still available for Greenpeace 
work.

<a  href="altair.html">
<img width=110 height=60 border=0 src="altair.gif" alt=" "> 
<B>Altair</B></a>  is  the  latest 
addition to the Greenpeace fleet. In the early spring of 1995  it 
became  clear that an extra vessel was needed on short notice  in 
the  North Sea.  For that purpose the mv Altair, a  former  Pilot 
vessel  from  the Dutch Government that had been converted  to  a 
yacht, was chartered for the summer. The vessel became well known 
in the months to come  campaigning against in the dumping of  the 
Brent  Spar. After she had accompanied the Spar back  to  Norway, 
the  Altair  took  up  a  new task  and  sailed  south  to  start 
campaigning the Mediterranean.

CHLORINE PLANT IN UNIQUE NATURE CONSERVATION AREA </TITLE>

<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=450><TR><TD>

<p></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>The highest administrative court in 
the Netherlands 'Raad van State'
overruled the environmental licences given to the 
American company BF Goodrich. The
court stated that BF Goodrich has to reduce the 
plant's discharge of chlorinated
substances with a factor ten, by lowering the 
standard from 1 mg per liter to 0,1. The 
request for suspension by Greenpeace and the 
Dutch Society for the Preservation of
the Wadden Sea has not been honoured.

<p>BF Goodrich can now build their CPVC 
(postchlorinated PVC) plant, it will be situated
on the edge of the Wadden Sea, an unique 
internationally recognised wetland and nature
conservation area. Environmental groups are 
appalled that the discharge of chlorinated
substances has not been forbidden. An increase in 
emissions of hazardous organochlorines
is contrary to recent internationally made 
agreements such as North Sea Ministers
Conference 1995 to prioritize hazardous 
organochlorines for elimination within one
generation (in other words by 2020). 

<p>During 1997 the 'Raad van State' will deal with 
the appeal of Greenpeace and the Dutch
Society for the Preservation of the Wadden Sea 
opposing the issued environmental
licences.

<P><B>Norwegian transnational <a href="am03.html">Resource Group International (RGI)</a> last
October launched the world's most efficient factory supertrawler. 
Almost 100 metres long with state-of-the-art fish finding
technology, the American Monarch is capable of fishing and
processing up to 1,200 tonnes of fish each day -- more than any
other fishing vessel in the world.  
 
<P>The $56 million vessel is to be put to work on the world's oceans
at a time when the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation says
70 per cent of fish stocks worldwide are either fully exploited,
over exploited or depleted.  The American Monarch's first
destination was to be the over-exploited <a href="chile01.html">fishing grounds of southern
Chile</a> where, according to RGI, it was to fish for southern blue
whiting and hoki (Patagonian grenadier).
 
<P>The American Monarch is the first of 25 new monster fishing
vessels to be built by RGI shipyards -- all subsidised by the
Norwegian Government to the tune of US$56.3 million (366 million
NOK).

<p>This report will show conclusively that the addition of the American Monarch to the fishery in Chilean
waters would result in overfishing and possible collapse of the stock and thus the communities dependent

<hr>
<br><p>WATCH THIS SPACE AS THE CAMPAIGN HOTS UP!

<p>GREENPEACE DEMANDS THAT:
 
<p>1. RGI withdraw its plans to send the American Monarch to Chile
or any other fishery on already fully- or over-exploited fish
stocks, or any region not covered by a strict management and
conservation regime, based on the precautionary approach;
 
<p>2. the Chilean government keep the American Monarch out of
Chilean fisheries;
 
<p>3. RGI cancel its plans to build 24 new fishing vessels;
 
<p>4. the Norwegian government cancel subsidies for the new vessels
RGI is planning to build;

 
<p>5. The Chilean government must establish and implement, as a
matter of urgency, a management plan for the Chilean southern
fisheries that will allow the recovery of the collapsed stocks
of southern hake and Golden conger (cusk eel). This process must
include formal mechanisms to ensure transparency and citizen
participation.  The plan must have as its primary objective to
ensure conservation of the marine environment, based on the
precautionary approach, and the socio-cultural integrity of
coastal communities;
 
<p>6. The Chilean government must also:
 <UL>
<LI> ensure the protection of critical habitats - nursery and 
spawning grounds - for southern fish stocks;
 
<LI>establish moratoria on those fishing operations where it cannot 
be demonstrated that they do not threaten the marine
biodiversity, for example, those which damage the benthos or 
species composition of the marine foodweb;
 
<LI>ensure the use of more selective fishing methods and gears;
 
<LI>ensure the reduction of bycatch to levels approaching zero;
 
<LI>undertake better and regionally coordinated research of 
Southern Cone fisheries, including the impact of fishing 
activities on fish stocks and marine ecosystems;
 
<LI> ensure that fisheries management decisions are transparent and 
open to public scrutiny and participation;
 </UL>

<p>7. The Chilean and Argentinean governments must:
 <UL>

<LI>combat illegal fishing in waters around the Southern Cone of 
Latin America and in Antarctic waters under the jurisdiction of 
CCAMLR;
 
<LI>impose the use of satellite control as well as strict at sea 
and on land control of fishing operations and fleets by all 
fishing nations in the area;
 </ul>

<P>8. Chile, Argentina and Norway must ratify the UN Agreement on 
the conservation and management of Straddling Fish Stocks and 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks;
 
<P>9. Chile and other states of the Southern Cone of Latin America 
must expeditiously negotiate a legally-binding regional
agreement, as called for in Article 8 of the UN Agreement, in 
cooperation with CCAMLR member countries, and in particular South 
Africa.

<BR>As part of a wider campaign against dumping, Greenpeace has maintained from the start that it is wrong in principle to dump oil 
installations at sea.
<P>To dump structures, such as the Brent Spar, in areas of high marine biodiversity 
     with poorly understood ecology infringes the precautionary 
     principle and presents unknown environmental risks.  To do so would set 
     dangerous precedents for future dumping of wastes at sea.  
     It ignores the impact of many similar decisions which would be taken 
     in isolation without consideration of their cumulative effect.  It 
     amounts to a reversal of promises made when development of North Sea 
     oil began. 
<P>The availability of the `quick and dirty' dumping option 
     reduces the incentive to pursue innovative decommissioning and 
     recycling options.  Further, it flies in the face of growing 
     international political and public consensus not to use the sea as a 
     dump for wastes.  
<P>The map left follows the course of the new Greenpeace ship M.V. Arctic Sunrise on its fact finding tour of North Sea Oil installations.

"Running Man" Millennium 2000 Appeal</H3></center>


On Saturday 7 December 1996 Robert Garside, "The Running Man," set off  from Londons Piccadilly Circus in a twin record-breaking attempt. If he suceeds he will be the first person to run around the world and in doing so will also cover the greatest distance ever run.<P>

As he attempts to achieve his own personal ambition he will also be raising money for Greenpeace UK and carrying with him the global Greenpeace values and messages:-<P>

<UL>
<LI>To protect biodiversity in all its forms
<LI>To prevent pollution and abuse of the earths oceans, land, air and fresh water.
<LI>To end all nuclear threats.
<LI>To promote peace, global disarmament and non-violence.
</UL>

Roberts journey will take him through 53 countries, across 5 continents and covers 54,000 kilometres (33,000 miles) and will take him over 3 years to complete. <P>

You can help Greenpeace and  "The Running Man" by making a donation or by sponsoring him as he crosses the world.  E-mail us at <A HREF="MAILTO:running.man@uk.greenpeace.org"><b>running.man@uk.greenpeace.org</b></A> with your name and address for a sponsor form.  <!--Download our sponsor form now. --><P>

<tt>SUBJECT: TRANSPORT OF GLASSIFIED RADIOACTIVE WASTE TO JAPAN

<p>SUMMARY: It has been agreed with the Japanese and British Authorities to make a tripartite approach to the State Department to inform the American Authorities confidentially of the date and the itinerary of the next transport of glassified radioactive waste to Japan.

<p>XXX


<p><p>Please contact the British and Japanese Embassies who should have received the same instructions.  The approach has to take effect as soon as possible (it should in effect take place before the industries COGEMA, BNFL, ORC, publish at a first press release in which the precise date of the transport will be announced).

<p>Please indicate confidentially that:

<p>- A ship with radioactive glassified waste, the "Pacific Teal", of the float of PNTL (Pacific Nuclear Tranport Limited), will leave the port of Cherbourg on 16 January 1997 with the destination of Japan (Mutsu Ogawara).

<p>- It will sail past the Cape of Good Hope, the East of Australia and through the South Pacific.

<p>- The Authorities of the States along the route will be informed, confidentially, on 23 December of the passage of the boat through their region.

<p>- The Authorities of the States along the two alternative routes will be informed in the west of 6 to 11 January.

<p>- An information campaign in the countries along the chosen route.

<B>NUCLEAR WASTE SHIPMENT TO GO VIA SOUTH AFRICA AND SOUTH PACIFIC.
THIS LATE ANNOUNCEMENT IS AN INSULT TO EN ROUTE STATES - says
GREENPEACE 
</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>AMSTERDAM,  January 14th, 1997 </B>



<p>One day after the departure of their
controversial nuclear waste shipment (1), representatives of the
French, Japanese and British plutonium industries have simply
announced that the transport will go to Japan via South Africa and the
South- West Pacific.  Greenpeace has called the late announcement an
"insult" to foreign nations. Despite protest by countries around the
world and their requests for prior notification and consultation
regarding the shipment, the "Pacific Teal" left Cherbourg on Monday,
January 13th without public disclosure of its route. 

<p>"Given that dozens of nations have demanded prior notification and
consultation regarding this shipment, this after-the-fact announcement
is like an arsonist who yells fire after burning down a house," said
Damon Moglen of Greenpeace International.  "Given the breadth of
concerns raised, this empty gesture is too little and too late to stem
the tide of international protest."

<p>While potential en route nations have demanded prior consultation and
requested basic information about the shipment's routing, safety
provisions, emergency planning, the industry's statement today only
states that the transport will go via "the Cape of Good Hope and the
South-West Pacific" and will arrive in Japan mid-March. 

<p>On Monday the 13th, hours after the transport slipped out of France,
the former French Environmental Minister, Segolene Royale announced
that the shipment posed "unacceptable risks."  Ms. Royale served as
France's Environmental Minister in 1992/93.  

<p>Controversy in France has also been fanned by the publication of new
evidence linking the La Hague plutonium reprocessing plant with
leukaemia cancers in the area around Cherbourg. In the article
published on January 10th in the British Medical Journal, Professor
Viel, the French epidemiologist who conducted the study, suggests that
the plant's radioactive contamination of beaches and local fish and
shellfish may be the cause.

<p>Most immediately threatened by the nuclear waste shipment is France
itself, followed by Spain and Portugal. and then the nations of the
Western African coast.  In February 1995, when France conducted its
first plutonium waste shipment to Japan onboard the British- flagged
"Pacific Pintail", Portuguese and Spanish naval vessels were deployed
to protect their 200-mile exclusive economic zones from the shipment.

<p>Footage is available from:
<p> WTN, London, +44 171 410 52 71
<br> Reuters, London, +44 181 965 77 33

<br><br><hr width=400 nowrap size=2><br>

<p>Note: 
<P>(1) The British-flagged freighter "Pacific Teal" left the French port
of Cherbourg yesterday with a cargo of forty blocks of glassified high
level nuclear waste bound for Japan.  The cargo of intensely
radioactive plutonium waste is a by-product of the separation of
weapon-usable plutonium from Japanese irradiated nuclear reactor fuel
processed at the French La Hague reprocessing plant.  Each block,
containing 150 litres of glassified fission products, weighs some 490
kilogrammes.  The waste is so intensely radioactive that a person
standing nearby a single unshielded glass block would receive a lethal
dose of radiation in less than 60 seconds.

<P>The transport on the Teal is the second of a series of global waste
shipments involving the movement of over 3,000 blocks of plutonium
waste in the course of the next ten to fifteen years.  Greenpeace has
warned that it expects two more plutonium waste transports from French
to Japan within the next 14 months.

<B>PLUTONIUM WASTE SHIPMENT LEAVES CHERBOURG.
GREENPEACE WARNS EN-ROUTE STATES OF IMMINENT THREAT</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>AMSTERDAM,  January 13th, 1997 </B>

<p>At around 7.00 am today, the
controversial high level nuclear waste shipment departed the port of
Cherbourg, France, bound for Japan.  The transport has left under a
veil of secrecy and sails directly into the growing opposition of
countries around the planet. 

<p>As the "Pacific Teal" left Cherbourg, Greenpeace warned all potential
en-route governments that the departure of the plutonium waste
shipment meant that the environment of their coastal waters was now
under imminent threat. Most immediately threatened was France itself,
followed by Spain and Portugal. 

<p>"Despite their promises, the Japanese and French Governments have as
yet given no indication of what route this ship will take and they
have failed to alleviate concerns raised around the world about the
safety of the transport," said Damon Moglen of Greenpeace
International.

<p>The hazardous nuclear cargo on-board the Pacific Teal contains 40
glassified blocks of highly radioactive nuclear waste. The material is
so intensely radioactive that a person standing nearby a single
unshielded glass block would receive a lethal dose of radiation in
less than 60 seconds. The transport on the Teal is the second of a
series of global waste shipments involving the movement of over 3,000
blocks of plutonium waste in the course of the next ten to fifteen
years.  

<p>The first shipment in February 1995 on-board the Pacific Pintail
witnessed Portuguese and Spanish naval vessels deployed to protect
their 200-mile exclusive economic zone from the shipment.

<p>The Teal's departure coincides with new evidence linking the La Hague
plutonium reprocessing plant with leukemia cancers in the area around
Cherbourg. In the article published on January 10th in the British
Medical Journal Professor Viel, the French epidemiologist who
conducted the study, suggests that the plant's radioactive
contamination of beaches and local fish and shellfish may be the
cause.

<p>"With the departure of the Teal, the health threat posed by plutonium
reprocessing inflicted upon the people of northern France is today
being exported to countries around the planet. The nuclear industry
has decided to disregard political and public opposition to this
unjustified and dangerous shipment. Governments should act immediately
to prohibit the Teal and all other nuclear waste and plutonium
shipments from their coastal waters. Ultimately, the only way to end
this nuclear nightmare is for the international community to stop the
global plutonium economy," said Jean-Luc Thierry, nuclear campaigner
of Greenpeace France.

<p>Since December, the MV Greenpeace ship has been touring Caribbean
nations to highligh the threat posed by nuclear shipments through the
region. In addition, the Rainbow Warrior has been campaigning in
southern Argentina and Chile near Cape Horn in opposition to nuclear
shipments. In 1995, the Pacific Pintail routed around Cape Horn on its
way to Japan. end

<B>GREENPEACE RELEASES CONFIDENTIAL FRENCH GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT ON
RADIOACTIVE SHIPMENT ROUTE</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>AMSTERDAM,  December 18th, 1996 - </B>



<p>According to a confidential document
obtained by Greenpeace, the second controversial plutonium waste
shipment from Europe to Japan will leave France for Japan on 16th
January 1997, on board the UK registered ship Pacific Teal. The route
for the ship is given as South Africa - east of Australia -south
Pacific and finally  Japan. The document, which authenticity has not
been confirmed yet, also states that en-route governments are to be
informed on 23rd December of the intended route of the waste.

<p>The same document appears to have been sent by the French Foreign
Ministry in Paris to its embassies in Tokyo, London and Washington, as
well as to senior officials in the French nuclear industry.

<p>"If the information in this document is correct, then it highlights
the desperation of the governments of France, Japan and the UK to
avoid the strong public and political opposition to nuclear shipments
in the Caribbean, Central and South America. Those responsible for
imposing this dangerous shipment on tens of countries around the world
should confirm immediately whether or not they intend to use the South
Africa /Australia route," said Shaun Burnie from Greenpeace
International.

<p>Since the beginning of December, Greenpeace has been campaigning in
the Caribbean and Panama Canal to oppose the shipment from using that
route. Today the vessel MV Greenpeace leaves Puerto Rico for the U.S.
Virgin Islands. On December 16th, the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior
arrived in the Argentine port of Ushuaia near Cape Horn to protest
against the waste shipment.

<p>The route given in the French document  is the same as the 1992
plutonium shipment on board the Akatsuki-maru, which caused many
countries to oppose the ship passing through their territorial waters.
In 1995, the Pacific Pintail, carrying plutonium waste to Japan, went
round South America despite being opposed by the governments of
Brazil, Argentina and Chile.

<p>"All routes for this particular shipment are unacceptable from an
environmental and security perspective. The governments involved have
to realise that it is not just these shipments that should be stopped,
but their entire plutonium programmes," said Burnie.

<B>NEW SEA SHIPMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE POSES THREAT TO HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENT, NEW REPORT WARNS</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>KINGSTON, Jamaica, Dec. 9th, 1996 - </B>

<p>If an imprending shipment of
intensely radioactive, glassified nuclear waste were to sink in
coastal waters, it could pose a long-term threat to people and
marine life because of unresolved packaging and salvage
problems, according to a Nuclear Control Institute (NCI) study

released today at a press conference with Greenpeace
International.
 
<p>The report by Dr. Edwin Lyman, NCI's scientific director, found
that in the event of a collision at sea resulting in damage to
the shipping casks, substantial radioactive contamination could
result unless salvage operations were carried out immediately. 
However, salvaging a damaged, highly radioactive cargo would be
"immensely difficult," and there is no evidence that a credible
salvage plan exists.
 
<p>A shipment of 40 contains of the highly radioactive waste is
expected to leave France for Japlan shortly.  Theis will be the
second shipment of vitrified waste, and it is to be followed by
dozens of shipments, each carrying 150 such containers.  The
most convenient route is through the Caribbean Sea and the
Panama Canal and across the Pacific Ocean -- the route used for
a 1984 shipment of plutonium from France to Japan.
 
<p>"En-route nations are justified in keeping this ship 200 miles
off shore," commented Dr. Lyman. "There is the potential for
severe health consequences if an accident led to chronic
exposure."  
 
Cesium-137, americium-241 and curium-244 are the key

radionuclides most likely to escape from the waste in an
accident.  The vitrified high-level waste (VHLW) is a byproduct
of chemically extracting plutonium from spent fuel of nuclear
power reactors in reprocessing plants.
 
<p>The report cites data from a 1987 study by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (NEA/OECD) that explored
sub-seabed disposal of nuclear waste.  In assessing potential
consequences of an accident involving a waste-transport vessel,
the study concluded that "coastal transportation accidents are
unacceptable."  
 
<p>Dr. Lyman found that the wrong type of stainless steel is being
used for the canisters of VHLW, making shipments of this waste
especially vulnerable.  "If a damaged VHLW cask were lost at sea
in shallow waters," according to Dr. Lyman's report, "contact of
the stainless steel VHLW canisters with highly corrosive
seawater would begin almost immediately.  Because the Type 309
stainless steel has been extensively sensitized it will undergo
pitting and stress-corrosion cracking at an accelerated rate,
exposing the glass underneath within a couple of months [p. 4]."
 
 
<p>Exposure of the glass to sea water would result in initial,
rapid leaching of the radionuclides, making immediate salvage
both imperative and difficult.  For example, "as much Cs-137
[cesium] would be released in the first month following contact
of the VHLW surface with water as would be released in the
following eleven months," Dr. Lyman determined [p. 5].
 
<p>Last year's shipment had been expected to take the Caribbean
route, but was forced instead to take a different course due to
widespread opposition throughout the Caribbean.  Instead, the
transport went around South America's Cape Horn, where it also
met with condemnation.  Argentina and Brazil ordered the ship to
remain outside their coastal waters, and Chile used a gunboat to
force the ship out of its exclusive economic zone.
 
<p>Earlier this year, at a meeting of the International Maritime
Organization, coastal nations along three potential routes of
the nuclear shipments asked for a binding code requiring prior
notification of voyages, advance consultation on
emergency-response planning, a clear-cut liability regime, and
a demonstrated ability to salvage lost cargos.

<B>GREENPEACE WILL DEMAND REGIONAL DECLARATION IN VIEW OF POSSIBLE
CROSSING OF NUCLEAR WASTE SHIPMENT</B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA. December 6th, 1996 - </B>

<P>
Greenpeace informed today that a demand will be put forward
requesting from the 34 nations gathered at the Continental
Summit of Sustainable Development the adoption of a joint
declaration and a stronger position in view of the possible
crossing of a new maritime shipment carrying radioactive wastes
along the American coastal countries.
 
<P>The environmental organization that is at present attending the
Hemispheric Tribune, a parallel meeting of NGOs that is taking
place simultaneously in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, warned about
the need for an urgent regional response in view of a new threat
that constitutes the imminent shipment of 40 highly radioactive
waste blocks from France to Japan.
 
<P>" This cargo is larger than the one carried on board the Pacific
Pintail in 1995 through the Cape Horn and again, the ship will
take the route that will mean less costs and  offer slight
political opposition" warned Juan Carlos Villalonga, Greenpeace
Southern Cone`s Energy Campaigner.

<P> Villalonga stressed that " the region is seriously involved in
this highly risk operation that France, Great Britain and Japan
want to carry out because the most probable routes for this new
shipment are the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal, and Cape
Horn in the Southern Cone region".
 
<P>Greenpeace sent its ship, MV Greenpeace, to the Caribbean region
with the intention to warn publicly about the risks of this
imminent nuclear shipment. This new cargo is being finished up
in the plutonium reprocessing plant in "La Hague", near
Cherbourg, France and, it is due to depart bound for Japan in
the forthcoming days"
 
<P>The shipment will carry two casks containing 40 blocks of

vitrified radioactive wastes of 20.500.000 curies of
radioactivity level (6.000 times larger than the level of the 
Russian satelite  that recently fell near the Chilean coast).
 
<P>" Maritime shipment of highly radioactive wastes is a practice
that involves potential catastrophic consequences for the
inhabitants and the economy of coastal countries situated along
the shipment route. Consequently, it is absolutely legitimate to
reject its crossing in order to prevent a new antecedent like
the Akatsuki Maru in 1992 and the Pacific Pintail in 1995"
declared Villalonga.
 
<P>In the last few years, countries from the Caribbean and Latin
America expressed their concern and opposition to  transboundary
movement of nuclear materials. Some nations from this region -
Argentina among them-  as well as regional organisms as the
CARICOM and the OPANAL, issued statements opposing to nuclear
wastes and plutonium shipment.

<B>  GREENPEACE SENDS SHIP TO CARIBBEAN TO WARN COUNTRIES 
                           OF IMMINENT NUCLEAR WASTE SHIPMENT
 </B></font>
 
<!--END TITLE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--INSERT DATE,TEXT---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><B>WASHINGTON, December 4th, 1996 - </B>           

 
<P>Greenpeace announced today that it has sent
its ship MV Greenpeace to the Caribbean ahead of an imminent Japanese
nuclear waste transport.  
 
<P>Greenpeace organized the tour to alert the public about the dangers of
nuclear transports between France, Britain and Japan which transit the
region despite broad public and political opposition.  The MV Greenpeace
was released earlier this year after being seized by French military forces
while campaigning against nuclear weapons testing at Moruroa atoll in the
Pacific.
 
<P>"A secret nuclear waste shipment is no Christmas present," said Greenpeace
Campaigner Bruce Hall.  "People put at risk in the Caribbean have a right
to know about these dangerous shipments.  If France and Japan won't warn of
the dangers, we will."
 
<P>The MV Greenpeace left Galveston, Texas, Tuesday evening and will arrive in
the Caribbean within a few days.  The ship's first port of call will be

<P>Kingston, Jamaica on December 9th.  After Jamaica, the ship will visit
Puerto Rico.  The 61 meter converted tugboat will remain in the region into
January.
 
<P>The imminent nuclear waste shipment is being prepared at the La Hague
plutonium "reprocessing" factory near Cherbourg, France and is expected to
leave for Japan within the next few weeks.  The transport will involve two
casks holding 40 glass blocks of extremely radioactive nuclear waste
containing some 20,500,000 curies of radioactivity (6,000 times more
radioactivity than contained in the Russian plutonium powered satellite
which recently crashed off the Chilean coast). This glassified nuclear
waste is so deadly that a person within one meter of a single unshielded
glass block would receive a fatal dose of radiation in less than one
minute.  
 
<P>While the final arrangements for the upcoming waste shipment have yet to be
disclosed, the most likely route appears to be through the Caribbean Sea
and the Panama Canal.  Japan has used this route to ship irradiated nuclear
fuel from its reactors to la Hague and Sellafield/THORP (UK) reprocessing
factories.  In turn, it is widely believed that the companies involved
would like to use the same route for the return shipments to Japan of
nuclear waste and weapons-usable plutonium.  In April 1995, the first
shipment of glassified waste steered away from the Carribbean and Panama
Canal in the face of loud opposition.  The shipment went around South
America also to much protest.
 
<P>During recent years Caribbean and Latin American nations have repeatedly
voiced concerns with and opposition to the transboundary movement of
nuclear materials.  Countries throughout both regions as well as regional
bodies like the CARICOM and OPANAL have made declarations of opposition to
transports of nuclear waste and plutonium.  Greenpeace is calling on these
nations and regional fora to formally reiterate their opposition.
 
<P>"Countries which do not oppose these transports may well find themselves
innocent bystanders in the midst of an environmental catastrophe," Hall
said.

<P><B>SHELL'S PROPOSALS FOR BRENT SPAR: 21 OUT OF 29 ARE OK GREENPEACE TELLS LONDON CONFERENCE
     
 <p>LONDON, SEPTEMBER 25th 1996</B>

<tt>
    
 <p>    Greenpeace supports 21 out of 29 of the proposals being considered by 
     Shell for disposing of the Brent Spar oil installation, a conference 
     in London heard today.
     
 <p>    Speaking at the `Brent Spar and After' conference organised by 
     Greenpeace Business, Chris Rose, Communications and Programmes 
     Director of Greenpeace UK, highlighted the fact that only one of 
     Shell's options now involved dumping the structure at sea.
     
 <p>    This was the only option which Greenpeace had an in-principle 
     objection to.  A further seven are too unclear for the environmental 
     organisation to support or comment on.
     
  <p>   Addressing an audience of leading UK business executives and 
     government officials, Chris Rose said that Shell's options showed 
     there was no engineering obstacle to bringing oil installations on 
     shore and recycling them.  It increased the case for Ministers at next 
     June's OSPARCOM (Oslo and Paris Commissions) meeting to convert the 
     current moratorium on dumping old oil installations at sea into a 
     permanent ban.
     
  <p>   Chris Rose said, "Based on Shell's options it seems clear that the 
     Spar is heading back to land.  The signs are that Shell is now 
     following the logic of environmental responsibility and public 
     opinion.  Governments should rule out all dumping as an option."
     
  <p>   Chris Rose also revealed that Greenpeace is contacting the major 
     engineering companies and consortia, unions and communities which 
     might receive the decommissioning work.  The aim is to encourage these 
     groups  to seek a consistent programme of decommissioning on land in 
     preparation for the 70 facilities in the North Sea which will need 
     decommissioning over the next decade.
     
<p>     Notes to correspondents:
<p>     1) Copy of the Greenpeace statement on the Brent Spar disposal options 
     available on request.
<p>     2)  Greenpeace has an in-principle objection to the Jan de Nul NV 
     (Belgium) proposal.  This proposal involved dumping the structure in a 
     dredged trench.
     
<p>     3)  The seven which Greenpeace is unable to support because of lack of 
     detail or likely problems are: 
 <ul><li>
    Wood-GMC (UK) - removal of topsides as training facility onshore, use 
     of column section in foundation of new quay facility at Mekjarvik 
     harbour.
<li>     AKER Offshore Partner a.s. (Norway) - towing and dismantling in 
     vertical, to Stord, Norway.
<li>     AMEC Process and Energy (UK) - re-use as coastal defence on UK east 
     coast, or causeway and marina on UK west coast 
 <li>    Brown and Root Energy Services (UK) - upending to horizontal and 
     towing to decommissioning for reuse and recycling at Nigg.
<li>     UMOE Haugesund AS (Norway) - towing with barge after movement by 
     semisubmersible crane to Haugesund for dismantling.
<li>     Land and Marine Engineering Ltd [Costain] (UK) - vertical dismantling 
     and disposal onshore.
<li>     Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering (UK) - towing to dry dock for 
     refurbishment, re-use or recycling at Hunterston.
</ul>     
<p>     4)  `The Brent Spar and After' Conference was organised by `Greenpeace 
     Business' to examine the changing relationship between governments, 
     industry and environmental groups as a result of the Brent Spar 
     controversy in 1995. It considered Greenpeace's solutions work which 
     seeks to address the problems of the environment as well as 
     confronting the industries responsible for creating them. 
     <p>
     5)  The Brent Spar is currently moored in a Norwegian Fjord after the 
     successful 1995 Greenpeace campaign to stop Shell dumping it in the 
     North East Atlantic.  Shell UK has been running a public consultation 
     process while it decides which decommissioning option to propose to 
     the UK Government.
     <p>
     6)  PLEASE NOTE:  `The Brent Spar and After' conference is not open to 
     the general media and we are unable to admit crews or photographers.

<P><B>GREENPEACE WELCOMES START OF OPERATIONS TO BRING ODIN ASHORE
 
<p>AMSTERDAM, SEPTEMBER 23rd 1996</B>

<tt>

<p>Greenpeace today welcomed
the start of the operation to bring ashore for dismantling the
recently decommissioned Odin platform off the West coast of
Norway.  
 
The operators of the platform, Esso, had previously proposed
to dump the jacket in situ as a solution for disposing the
installation.  The Norwegian government then refused

permission to dump and stated that the entire structure should
be brought ashore, a decision which Greenpeace strongly
supported.
 
<p>"The fact that the Odin platform and jacket are being brought
ashore illustrates the feasibility of on-shore dismantling,

recycling and re-use of large decommissioned offshore
structures" said Paul Horsman, Greenpeace International Oil
Campaigner. "The Norwegian government should be congratulated
in making Esso remove their industrial waste from the sea to
be dismantled in a controlled environment ashore."
 
<p>Greenpeace recognizes that the best possible practice is to
bring these installations ashore. This view has been reflected
at the last North Sea Ministers' Conference (1) and in the
Decision 95/1 made by the Member states of the Oslo Commission
(2) last year.  These decisions (3) were made in the knowledge
of the increasing number of offshore installations which are
approaching the time of their decommissioning. 
 
<p>More than 400 platforms exist in the area of the North Sea

between the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and the
Netherlands, consisting of a total of 2.5 million tonnes of
steel, 190,000 tonnes of alluminium,
 
180,000 tonnes of stainless steel and 170,000 tonnes of
copper. Among them, there are 70 potential candidates for
dumping at sea and, in order to recognize the full potential
for recycle and re-use, all these platforms should be brought
ashore.
 
<p>Following last year's successful campaign to prevent the
dumping of Shell's Brent Spar offshore installation,
Greenpeace noted that all installations decommissioned since
then have been
brought to shore for dismantling. end

<BR><HR>

<p>NOTES:
 
<p>(1)      The 4th Ministerial Conference on the Protection  of
the  North  Sea in Esbjerg, Denmark, on June 8-9 stated that:
<br>
[...]  The  Ministers are aware that an increasing  number  of
offshore  installations in the North Sea are  approaching  the
time  of  their  decommissioning.  Even  if   the  offshore 
installations  are emptied of noxious and hazardous 
materials,  they  might still if dumped or left at sea, pose a 
threat  to  the marine environment. Disposal of such
installations on land  by 

recycling recyclable materials and by ensuring  safe and 
controlled  disposal  of  unavoidable  residues  would  be  in 
accordance   with   generally  agreed  principles  of  waste
management policy. (4th Ministerial Declaration on the
Protection  of the North Sea, Paragraph 54)
 
<p>(2)     The Oslo Commission (OSCOM) regulates the dumping of
wastes at sea in the North East Atlantic. In adopting the
OSCOM Decision 95/1 at their meeting in Brussels in June 1995,
the Member states decided: To  agree  on  a  moratorium  on 
the  disposal  at  sea of decommissioned offshore
installations  until   the   Oslo  Commission or a Commission

in its succession has adopted a Decision  on  the disposal of
offshore installations with a view to banning the disposal of
such
installations at sea. (Operative Paragraph 1 of OSCOM Decision
95/1)
 
<p>(3)     Norway and the United Kingdom both filed reservations
on Paragraph 54 of the 4th North Sea Declaration and OSCOM
Decision 95/1. The fact that Odin is being brought ashore
illustrates that there are no technical reasons for continuing
with these
reservations.

<P><B>GREENPEACE STATEMENT: SHELL BRIEFING- THE NEXT STEPS FOR THE BRENT SPAR

<P>LONDON, 4th July 1996</B>

<tt>


<P>Greenpeace welcomes Shell's announcement of progress towards a 
     solution for the decommissioning of the Brent Spar. 
     
    
<P> Greenpeace scientist Dr Helen Wallace said, "The Brent Spar campaign 
     was about precedents.  Shell set one when it agreed not to dump the 
     installation at sea - everything since has come on land.  It can do so 
     again by investing in best environmental practice, something which can 
     never include dumping at sea".
     
  
<P>   "The Brent Spar represents something much bigger than one oil platform 
     or a battle between Greenpeace and Shell.  It represents the future of 
     our oceans and the public's desire for industrial responsibility.  


<P>    People won't accept oil companies dumping their rubbish in the sea, 
     they want serious, careful solutions to the problems of waste".
     

<P>     The main impediment to a best environmental option continues to be the 
     UK Government which defies international political and public opinion 
     by retaining sea dumping as an option.  In June the UK Government once 
     again failed to join the majority in reaffirming OSPAR's (Oslo and 
     Paris Commission) decision to implement a sea dumping ban in 1997.
     
 
<P>    Greenpeace will continue to monitor the process and to cooperate in 
     finding an on shore decommissioning solution.

<P><B>GREENPEACE CATCHES SHELL DUMPING OIL ON ANNIVERSARY OF ITS BRENT
SPAR VICTORY  -  CALLS FOR PLATFORM DUMPING BAN.

<P>NORTH SEA, 20th JUNE 1996</B>

<tt>


<P>Just one day before the anniversary
of Shell Oil Company's decision not to dump its Brent Spar oil
platform at sea, Greenpeace has discovered two oil spills
emanating from  Amoco and Shell company platforms.


<P>The new Greenpeace campaign ship, Arctic Sunrise, discovered the oil
slicks while patrolling the waters near platforms which may soon
themselves be destined for ocean dumping.


<P>Shell initially down-played the oil spill, claiming it was only
9.6 litres of oil that washed overboard.  However after
Greenpeace measured the slick as being 300 metres wide and four
kilometres long, they were forced to admit their mistake and
issue a news release on 19 June revising the figure to "an upper
estimate of 300 litres."

<P>"These slicks are part of the thousands of tonnes of routine or
accidental discharges of oil which take place each year," said
Greenpeace Executive Director Thilo Bode.  "They illustrate the
offshore oil industry's continuing disregard for the marine
environment which became so painfully obvious last year."  
Greenpeace has escalated its campaign this year to ensure that
the political decision taken at the Oslo Paris (OSPAR) 
Convention last year to ultimately ban the dumping of offshore 
rigs is achieved.

<P>Norway and the United Kingdom were the only countries in the 
region to fail to commit to adopting the ban in last year's 
decision.  During this week's OSPAR meeting taking place in 
Oslo, UK and Norway continue to stand alone against the strong 
wishes of all of the 11 other nations bordering the North-East 
Atlantic for a full ban.

<P>"Until ocean dumping is completely prohibited, the oil and gas
industry will continue to look fondly at the seas as their own
private dustbin," said Greenpeace Campaigner Rick Le Coyte. "Yet it is
now obvious to all but the most stubborn, and irresponsible polluters
that land decommissioning is the vastly preferable option from an
environmental and economic viewpoint."


<P>There are over 400 rigs in the North Sea with about 75 coming e 
to the end of their working lives in the next ten years.  
Greenpeace demands that they all be recycled on land.

<P><B>GREENPEACE DISCOVERS OIL SLICK AT SHELL NORTH SEA PLATFORM
  
<P>NORTH SEA, 19th JUNE 1996</B>

<tt>
<P> The Greenpeace vessel , Arctic Sunrise, 
discovered an oil slick coming from a Shell operated platform in the North Sea yesterday afternoon, during a tour of  oil and gas i
nstallations which may be dumped at sea. 


<P>Greenpeace campaigner Christian Bussau, from aboard the Arctic 
Sunrise, said the slick was 300 metres wide and four kilometres long . It was heading on the ocean current away from the 
Dunlin Alpha platform operated by Shell UK,  in the Dunlin field 120 
miles north-east of the Shetland Islands.


<P>The Shell operator of the platform confirmed by telephone that there 
had been an accident on Tuesday morning and said they had informed the British authorities about it. A Shell spokesperson told Gre
enpeace that the slick  involved  9.6 litres of oil and the company 
estimated this quantity of oil would cover an area about 1 km by 20 metres.


<P>This week a  meeting of the Oslo Paris Commission (OSPAR) in Oslo 
confirmed the current moratorium on the dumping of oil and gas platforms at sea,  with the view to a permanent ban, expected in 1997.
 


<P>It is one year since a direct action by Greenpeace and a massive 
public protest and boycott forced Royal Dutch Shell on June 20, 1995,  to reverse its decision to dump the Brent Spar oil platform in 
the North East Atlantic. The Brent Spar is one of  400 oil and gas 
platforms to be decommissioned from the North Sea. 


<P> Following the Brent Spar campaign OSPAR,  which regulates  marine 
pollution, passed a moratorium on the dumping of  platforms at sea. The  moratorium was passed on June 29, 1995  by 11 votes to 2  (
Norway and the United Kingdom). 


<P>Since the Brent Spar campaign last summer Shell has announced that it 
will bring its Leman BK 
platform ashore rather than at sea. Three other platforms will now 
also be decommissioned on land: the North-East Frigg (Elf), the Viking A (Conoco/BP)  and the Odin platform, after the Norwegian gov
ernment  turned down an application by Esso to dispose of the 
structure at sea. 


<P>Continuing on the work from the Brent Spar campaign, Greenpeace is 
currently conducting a tour of oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. The new ship, Arctic Sunrise, is documenting North Sea oil pl
atforms whose owners have publicly stated that they want to dump 
their installations at sea including North West Hutton (Amoco) and Heather  (Unocal).

<P><B>NEW GREENPEACE SHIP LAUNCHED TO OPPOSE DUMPING OF NEXT 'BRENT
SPAR'
  
<P>AMSTERDAM, 6th JUNE 1996</B>

<tt>

<P>Greenpeace unveiled its newest environmental action ship, ARCTIC SUNRISE, today from the docks
at the Oosterlijke Handelskade in Amsterdam. The ship will depart
Friday for a tour of British and Norwegian oil platforms that are
planned to be decommissioned in the near future. Greenpeace
intends to ensure that the British and Norwegian governments do
not allow the dumping of these platforms.
 
<P>The Arctic Sunrise was originally built in Norway in 1975 for use
as a seal hunting ship. Such ships were the targets of Greenpeace
actions in the 1980s.
 
<P>"Today's launch is indicative of the fact that good things can
come of formerly bad ideas," said Greenpeace International
Executive Director Thilo Bode at a press conference today. "Just
as a former seal killer has been transformed into an instrument
for environmental protection, so have we demonstrated that
offshore platforms can be recycled to provide jobs and useful
resources, rather than be dumped at sea."
 
<P>Last year, in one of the organisation's most publicised
campaigns, Greenpeace stopped Shell in its attempts to dump the
Brent Spar installation into the sea. Following the public outcry
over oil companies using the seas as their private industrial
waste dustbins, the majority of governments from North Sea states
responded responsibly by passing a decision at the Oslo
Convention meeting in June last year for a moratorium on the
ocean dumping of offshore installations with a view to a future
ban. Only the British and Norwegian governments expressed
reservations to this decision.
 
<P>Next week, at this year's meeting of the Oslo Commission in Oslo,
governments are expected to take the next step in translating the
moratorium into a permanent ban, expected in 1997. Greenpeace
will be attending the meeting to ensure the full implementation
of last year's decision.
 
<P>"Despite the great victory last year, the fight is not over yet.
Greenpeace will not drop this case until the United Kingdom and
Norway join the majority of nations now agreeing to put an end
to dumping.", said Greenpeace Campaigner Simon Reddy.
 
<P>"Our tour takes place one year after Shell decided not to dump
the Brent Spar on the 20th June 1995," said Reddy, "Since then,
five other decisions have been made to bring platforms ashore
instead of dumping them. We are sailing to ensure that this trend
becomes law."
 
<P>There are over 400 rigs in the North Seas. Approximately 75

<P><B>Notes to Editors:</B>
 
<P>Since Shell decided to not dump the Brent Spar on 20 June 1995,
Shell also announced the decision to bring the Leman BK platform
ashore. Other installations in British waters to come ashore are
the Viking Complex and Frigg Flare. The Norwegian government
decided to bring Elf's North East Frigg and Esso's Odin
installation ashore (despite Esso's original plan to dump).
 
<P>Earlier this year, Greenpeace sent letters to all of the major
oil companies operating in the Norwegian and British sectors of
the North Sea asking them if they would comply with the Oslo
Commission Decision. Greenpeace also asked to visit any platforms
that were intended to be dumped. Although Greenpeace has received
responses from 14 of the companies, not one of these companies
stated that it intended to comply with the Oslo Commission
Decision and not one invited Greenpeace to visit their platforms.
 
<P>Photographs of the platforms that will be visited during the
Greenpeace tour in June are available form Greenpeace
Netherlands. Greenpeace intends to visit North West Hutton
(Amoco); Heather (Unocal), Maureen (Phillips) and the Ekofisk
Complex (Phillips). The operators' current preferred option for
decommissioning North West Hutton and Heather platforms involves
dumping.

<P><B>The Brent Spar Sets the Industry Precedent</B>

<P><B>The 20th of June, 1995 was a great day for Greenpeace and the 
environment. </B>This was the day when the occupation by Greenpeace of the disused Brent Spar oil platform, a massive public protest and boyc
ott,  forced Royal Dutch Shell  to reverse its decision to dump the 
installation in the north-east Atlantic. However this was only a provisional victory . The Brent Spar is one of  400 oil and gas installations to be decommissioned from the North Sea.

<P> Following the Brent Spar campaign the nations of the Oslo Paris 
Commission (OSPAR),  which regulates  marine pollution, passed a moratorium on the dumping of  platforms at sea. The  moratorium was passed on June 29, 1995  by 11 votes to 2  (Norway and the United 
Kingdom). The next step, a permanent ban by 1997,  will be discussed at  the OSPAR meeting this week (June 17-21) of  government offic
ials in Oslo. Greenpeace's marine policy expert Remi Parmentier and 
offshore  industry campaigner Simon Reddy will be attending the OSPAR meeting.

<P>Since the Brent Spar campaign last summer Shell has announced that it 
will bring its Leman BK 
platform ashore. Three other platforms will now also be 
decommissioned on land: the North-East 
Frigg (Elf), the Viking A (Conoco/BP)  and the Odin platform, after 
the Norwegian government  
turned down an application by Esso to dispose of the structure at 
sea.  (The Brent Spar is currently in the Erfjord in Norway and Shell has received 400 proposals on what to do with it. A decision on
 the fate of the Brent Spar is expected in 1997).

<P>Continuing on the work of the Brent Spar campaign <a href="prjun06.html">the new Greenpeace 
ship, the  Arctic Sunrise</a>, is documenting North Sea oil and gas platforms whose owners have publicly stated that they want to dump their installations at sea. These include North West Hutton (Amoco) 
and  (Unocal).    

<P>For over 20 years, Greenpeace has demonstrated its commitment to 
protect the oceans and the diverse forms of life which depend on them. Successful campaigns have led to the global ban on the dumping 
of radioactive and industrial wastes at sea. If the Brent Spar had 
been dumped at sea it would have undermined these existing bans.

<P>The alternative to dumping these installations is to take them ashore 
to be dismantled and recycled. this would not only be best for the environment but would safeguard or create jobs in a decommissi
oning industry with global market potential. It would allow the 
re-use of vast quantities of materials - including 2.6 million tonnes of steel from the 400 installations in the North Sea alone.

<P><B>The Greenpeace Mistake in the Brent Spar Campaign</B>

<P>Greenpeace campaigned to stop the dumping of  the Brent Spar  
primarily on the basis of the concern 
over principle and precedents. However we also recognised that there 
were deficiencies in the waste 
inventory supplied by Shell. This inventory stated that the structure 
contained 100 tonnes of toxic sludge, including heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury, 30 tonnes of low level radioactive wast
e and a quantity of waste oil. Had identical wastes been created on 
land and packed in barrels, rather than on an oil installation, it would have been strictly illegal to dump them in the sea.  

<P>A political response to Greenpeace's Brent Spar campaign began on 
June 8-9, 1995,  when the North Sea Conference called for a ban on disposal at sea offshore installations.  

<P>Four days before Shell announced it would not dump the Brent Spar on 
June 20, 1995,  and seven 
weeks after the campaign had begun, Greenpeace attempted to address 
one of the deficiencies in Shell's waste inventory for the Brent Spar by trying to measure the quantity of waste oil. This also fol
lowed a decision by the Ministerial Meeting of the North Sea 
Conference to call for a ban on disposal at sea of offshore installations, which must be implemented by OSPAR. Unfortunately Greenpeace ma
de a mistake in its oil sampling which led to an overestimate of the 
amount of oil on board. Greenpeace publicly released these estimates on June 16 stating that up to 5,500 tonnes of  oil was aboard
 the Brent Spar.  When this error was  discovered, Greenpeace 
apologised for the error to Shell by letter. Later analysis of the Brent Spar by independent experts, the Norwegian certification company
 Det Norske Veritas (DNV),  revealed there was only about 75-100 
tonnes of oil on board.  Shell  originally estimated there was 50 tonnes of oil on board. 

<P><B>However the Greenpeace letter to Shell was reported in the media as 
an apology which 
completely undermined the whole basis for the campaign. This could 
not be further from the truth. The estimates of oil on board the Brent Spar were incidental and not central to Greenpeace's argument
s against dumping the structure at sea. The Brent Spar campaign was 
based on the information Shell provided to the UK government, the necessity of avoiding a precedent being set for other platforms a
nd the principle that the ocean is not a dumping ground.  </B>

<P>The fact that Greenpeace was arguing a case on principle and 
precedent did not mean that we did not or do not still have specific criticisms of the science used by Shell in the case of the Brent Spar.

<P>The use of science by Shell and the Government was influenced by a 
different set of principles - primarily self-serving commercial expediency.  Where there were scientific uncertainties, the benefit 
of  the doubt always went to Shell at the expense of environmental 
precaution.

<P><B> Shell's scientific case for deep sea dumping had serious failings 
including: </B>
<UL>
 <LI>- the omission of a proper inventory of the wastes on the structure.
 <LI>- an incorrect appraisal of the marine environment at the dump site.
<LI>- an unconvincing projection of how the structure would degrade 
during and after dumping.
<LI> - inadequate consideration of alternatives to sea dumping and 
benefits  of recovered materials
<LI> - unsubstantiated assumptions, confidentiality of supporting 
evidence and poor consultation
</UL>

<P>For each of these reasons there can have been no proper assessment of 
 the environmental impact. Scientists from the Scottish Association of  Marine Sciences with great expertise in the marine enviro
nment of the proposed dump site have described aspects of Shell's 
environmental assessment as "very far fetched and shoddy" and described the local ecology as having species diversity that "may rival
 that of the tropical rainforest".
<P>
 More recently in April 1996, the Scientific Group on Decommissioning 
Offshore Structures, a panel of scientists  set up by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council at the request of Mr T Eggar,
 the Energy Minister, concluded:

 <UL>
<LI>-  Both cumulative and case by case impacts of the disposal of  
offshore oil installations should be assessed, because continued  disposals with small individual impact might give rise, by small  in
crements, to an unacceptably large overall impact.

<LI> -  Some means should be sought to take public acceptability into 
account in evaluating future marine environmental impact assessments

<LI> -  Nothing in [their] report should be taken as promoting the deep 
sea  disposal of decommissioned offshore structures, or of any other wastes.  

<LI>  -  Any decision to proceed, or not to proceed, with dumping oil 
structures or other wastes in the ocean involves social, economic,  ethical, and aesthetic considerations which are outside the compe
tence  of the group, and judgements in which the technical assessment 
of the  environmental impact is only one factor, and not necessarily the most  important one.
     
<LI> -  From an engineering point of view the difficulties and hazards of 
 onshore disposal are no more than have already been encountered and successfully overcome for other installations.
    
<LI> -  Many factors should influence a decision on whether disposal of  
offshore structures as waste is an appropriate course of action. They  should have included such general considerations as the nee
d to      conserve energy and natural resources by reducing, re-using 
and  recycling potential waste whenever practicable.
     
<LI> -  The deep sea environment can be surprisingly biologically rich, 
but our level of certainty regarding the environment, and hence our  predictive ability with regard to environmental impacts, is mu
ch lower  (in the deep sea) than for inshore areas on the continental 
shelf.  
</UL>

<P>These scientists reserve judgement on the best fate for the Brent 
Spar, but they are clear that the scientific work done so far has serious shortcomings.  Therefore the dispute between Greenpeace and
      Shell should not be seen as only one of 'emotion' versus 
`science'. 


<P><B>Rigs to Reefs: Not in the North Sea</B>

<P>Some representatives of the oil  industry have suggested that the 
"Rigs to Reef" programme in North 
America could be adopted by North Sea states to produce reefs that 
would benefit North Sea fish 
stocks. Greenpeace does not consider that this is a serious option. 
Neither does the fishing 
community.

<P> In America, over  1000 platforms have been decommissioned. 
Approximately 900 to land and 
 100 to reefs. Reefs have been created in designated areas. These are 
warm water areas with reef 
forming species in water depths of 30 metres. Their primary benefit 
has been for the sports angling 
organisations.

<P>In the North Sea the same ideas have been argued for our deep water 
platforms, but the two are not 
compatible. In the Northern North Sea, the platforms are in up to 180 
metres of water,  with future 
operations in even deeper water (down to 800 metres), and  sitting on 
top of toxic drill cuttings piles 
(25000 cubic metres under  NW Hutton). The species present are very 
different to those in the 
Gulf of Mexico and their responses to artificial reef structures are 
largely unpredictable. Furthermore, 
the creation of a few reefs will  not solve the North Sea overfishing 
problems.
     
<P><B>The <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/oilrpt.htm">NERC report</a> on the Brent Spar for the UK government agreed: " We 
accept these reservations 
and believe that it would be similarly  difficult to claim a 
significant beneficial effect from the 
emplacement of any structure in the deep sea, even one completely 
stripped of any contamination. It is 
true that studies of deep ocean wrecks (eg the Titanic and the 
Central America) often report the 
presence of more fishes, and often of other animal groups, on and  
around the wrecks than in the 
neighbouring  area. However, we know of  no evidence to suggest that 
a wreck increases the total 
biomass or  affects its taxonomic make-up or, indeed, how such a 
change could be judged an 
'improvement'..... "

But there are also some very basic and profound similarities. One of these similarities can be found in the physiological process governed by the endocrine system. In animal and human foetal development alike, specialised receptors await  messages carried by a particular hormone to which they have a high affinity. Only when the instructions inherent in those messages have been delivered is the appropriate biological action triggered. Thus the development of the human male sexual organs depends on  the release of testosterone at precisely the right time.<P>Hormone disrupting chemicals, if present during foetal development, interfere with this message system. Some hormone disrupters actually mimic the bodies own hormones, fooling the receptors into accepting phoney instructions. Others attach themselves to the receptors and block out the real hormones. In the case of sex hormones the result can be irreversable damage to the reproductive system that may not manifest itself until adulthood.<P>Perhaps the most alarming thing about hormone disrupting chemicals is the way in which they can defy the classical toxicological dose-response model. Impaired function has been observed in laboratory  rats at very low doses. <a href="cerats02.html">(R. Sharpe et al 1995)</a> It appears that the timing of the dose is more important than  the quantity. <P>In recent years there has been an increasing number of observations of strange behaviour and reproductive failures in wildlife.<a href="62indsun.html">(Colborn et al 1996)</a>  But because hormonally induced reproductive problems do not manifest themselves until the next generation, they have tended to go unnoticed and it is only now that these problems are being associated with industrial chemicals.<P>For some time it has been suspected that human sperm counts have been declining, by as much as 50% in the last 50 years (Carlsen et al 1992). Although there seems to be some geographic variation and some studies report no decline in sperm quality <a href="53bmjbuj.html">(Bujan et al.)</a>, <a href="601semen.html">(Fisch et al.)</a>, recent research has added to the evidence that both the quality and quantity of human semen is declining in some ares. The total number of motile sperm in the ejaculate of  Scottish men born in the 1970's was found to be 25% lower than that of those born in the 1950's. <a href="52bmjirv.html">(BMJ Feb 96)</a><P>The key question now is what is causing this? Could it be the widespread presence of hormone disrupting chemicals in the environment? Or is there another explanation? Smoking, has been blamed by some, as have other lifestyle changes. <P>Below we present the current evidence. Details of the most important papers published in the leading journals, by scientists on the cutting edge of this research.

<P><H1><KBD>Danger in this drive for food profits. </KBD></H1>

<P><B>John Gray</B>

<P>BY CHRISTMAS most of the processed foods we buy in supermarkets will contain soya bean that has been genetically altered.

<P>In several parts of the world research is being undertaken on transplantation to humans of organs that have been taken from genetically manipulated animals. Many of the detergents, sprays and pesticides that we use-in our homes and gardens contain synthetic chemicals that, according to some scientists, can disrupt human hormonal balance and may be implicated in the decline of male fertility. In these and innumerable other ways scientific and technological advances are being used to remodel the natural world to suit human needs. In using science in these ways, we are creating for ourselves an environment that has never before existed, and whose dangers are incalculable. Governments, and some scientists, tell us that it is to science that we must turn for an assessment of the risks we are running and how to limit them.
                 
<P>The history of the crisis surrounding BSE ("mad cow disease") should have taught us that such reassurances are not worth much, A few months ago there was much talk by government ministers of turning to "the science" to tell us what the risks are and how best to control them. The clear implication was that if only we rely on "the science" then we will be safe. In part, this was a routine political cop-out, an alibi for avoidable errors of policy on the part of a government that ceased to be trusted some time ago. At the same time, this kind of public discourse reflects a cardinal fact of life in late modern Britain. For most people nowadays science is the only institution that possesses anything akin to authority.

<P>People turn to science for what religions no longer supply - a sense of certainty                  Much of the power of science in late modern cultures comes from the fact that unlike the churches, it operates an effective system of censorship against heretics, and is not riven constantly by public schisms. For many today, the appeal of science is that it                                   seems to offer an escape from the burdens of freedom of thought and individual judgement. In this cultural climate, in which science is used as an anodyne against doubt and anxiety, it is hardly surprising that politicians should try to use "the science" to get
themselves off the hook.
                                  
<P>The certainty which people seek in science is, of course, an illusion. On many of the issues that worry people today there is no scientific consensus. Claims that synthetic chemicals contribute to declining sperm levels  are strongly contested. Scientific estimates of the risks of global warming vary widely. No doubt some of the differences among scientists about the nature and magnitude of current environmental risks arise from rivalries among pressure groups and from the power of  vested interests.
                      
<P>The real source of scientific uncertainty in many of these matters, however, is the novelty of our present condition. There has been explosive growth of scientific knowledge about genetics over the past generation; but no one knows what will be the effects of introducing genetically engineered plants or animals into natural environments. A great deal has been learnt about viruses and the immune system                                                  since the emergence of Aids; but the consequences of transplanting the organs of pigs                                    into human beings remain unknown. In forging ahead with such experiments we are taking risks - with human health, the wellbeing of other animal species and the environment about- which science can, at present, tell us very little. We need basic scientific research - at present badly underfunded in Britain - to identify emerging dangers to the environment. We are, in effect, turning the planet and our own everyday lives into the site of vast unsupervised, scientific experiments, whose risks we can know, if at all, only retrospectively.  In this unprecedented situation we would be wise to consider adopting a precautionary approach to environmental dangers. We should be willing to forgo promising technological innovations if they carry catastrophic risks: even if current scientific knowledge suggests that the probability of disaster is low. We should put the responsibility on those who manufacture new environmental risks and thereby shift the initiative to their potential and actual victims. 

<P>APPLYING a principle of this sort entails an enormous departure from present practice. It can easily be caricatured as a new form of Luddism. It involves huge changes in industries, such as farming, in which intensive methods are currently driven by the imperatives of commercial survival. It shifts the assessment of risk from being the exclusive prerogative of scientific expertise to being a matter for the ethical and political judgements of lay people. If it could be made politically palatable - a very
tall order in a culture sustained by the faith that there are technical fixes for all
human ills - a precautionary approach to new technologies might safeguard us against
many of the dangers we are at present confronting. Many emerging hazards to human
health and the environment come from interactions among new technologies that, taken in isolation from one another, seem reasonably safe. New biotechnologies are defended on the ground that genetically engineered crops will need fewer pesticides and chemical ,fertilizers. We cannot, know, though, how new forms of life that appear safe in laboratory tests will react when they are released - irreversibly - into the wider world. Their interactions with their natural counterparts and with synthetic chemicals already in the environment will be largely unpredictable. Adopting a precautionary approach to genetic engineering and other technologies could protect us against many dangers. 

<P>But not perhaps, against some of the worst risks. Amongst the many factors
contributing to the BSE crisis the feeding of an herbivorous species with animal protein rendered from the same species stands out starkly. There can be few clearer expressions of the modern view of the earth as a resource to be exploited for the benefit of humans. A society in which the feeding of cow remains to other cows can pass almost unnoticed until disaster strikes is one in which the very idea of nature is all but dead. No improvement in the calculus of risks is likely to protect a culture in the grip of  scientific and technological hubris from further environmental catastrophes.

<P><H3><KBD>Deadly peril in our culture of denial.
Asbestos, radiation, now BSE ... ministers always act too late, writes Geoffrey Lean</KBD></H3>

<P>HERE, unforgivably, we go again.  The Government's handling of the BSE crisis is the latest result of 
a culture of denial that has mismanaged hazard after hazard, from asbestos to lead in petrol, from 
radiation to acid rain, from pesticides to threats to the ozone layer. 

<P>The pattern is scandalously repetitive: the long outright denial of danger, the reliance on a limited 
range of selected scientific advice, the marginalisation and ridicule of experts who issue warnings, the 
demand for proof, the reluctant half-measures, and, finally, after the damage is long done, the hurried 
and humiliating U-turn.

<P>Wednesday's abrupt announcement of a suspected link between BSE and human brain disease - on the 
day that a letter was to go to schools recommending they put beef back on their menus - differed only 
in the size of the potential disaster.

<P>Once again, as with asbestos and radiation, the authorities have only accepted the possibility of danger 
when confronted with corpses.  This is a recipe for catastrophe since the diseases caused by many 
pollutants have as long a latency.  Asbestos, for example, was not properly regulated until the early 
1980s, and so its toll is still rising: it will soon overtake car accidents as the main cause of premature 
death in Britain.  Ministers delayed phasing out lead in petrol, despite compelling US evidence of 
damage to children's brains, until similar effects were found in British children - as if there were some 
great physiological difference between them. 

<P>Demanding proof of damage to health betrays a misunderstanding of science.  Proof is hard to 
establish: just look at the long wrangle over smoking and cancer.  Governments should stick to the 
"precautionary principle", increasingly enshrined in international environmental treaties, that action 
should be taken in time to avoid serious risks turning into disasters.

<P>Professor Derek Bryce-Srnith warned of the dangers of lead in petrol from the 1950s onwards - he 
was ridiculed and marginalised by the medical and political establishment.  Alice Stewart, who first 
warned of the dangers of radiation in pregnancy, came under similar assault.  One of Britain's top 
officials told me that Professor Irving Selicoff, who did more than anyone to sound the alarm on 
asbestos, was "evil". 

<P>Those, like Professor Richard Lacey and Dr Harash Narang whose warnings about BSE now stand 
vindicated, have also suffered.  Lacey has been labelled politically suspect while Narang was fired 
from his job at the Public Health Laboratory Service.

<P>Labour governments have followed this pattern as well as Conservative ones.  But Thatcherism added 
two new dimensions.  First, it stressed cost-benefit-analysis before taking decisions on pollution and 
health.  Britains new Environment Agency, which starts work next week, is required to pay 
particular attention to this.  But the costs of curbing a hazard are immediate and quantifiable, and 
they fall heavily on a distinct and vociferous industry; the benefits of avoiding a putative epidemic are 
unproveable and hard to asses, and scattered among the population.

<P>Worse, ministers have scrapped regulations designed to protect the public.  Their de-regulation drive 
has recently allowed manufacturers to use toxic wastes as fuel.  Last week, a leaked letter from the 
chairman of the Health and Safety Executive warned that cuts were endangering its ability to do its 
job.  As we report on page 2, the incoming Thatcher government scrapped controls, proposed by 
Labour in the late 1970s, on feeding sheep meat to cattle. 

<P>Perhaps ministers will learn from the BSE fiasco.  But don't bet on it.  Bet instead on a similar culture 
of denial over the next big threat, a decline in male fertility from the use of chemicals that mimic the 
effects of oestrogen.  We should see early evidence of the Government's attitude on this some time 
next month.

<P><B>CORRESPONDENCE, Nature, Vol 369, 30 June 1994</B>


<P><B>Prevention rather than cure</B>


<P>SIR - An innovative principle is emerging in international environmental policies of 
northwest Europe and Scandinavia. The precautionary approach is encouraging new 
thinking through its emphasis on clean production methods and prevention of 
environmental contamination in the belief that it is cheaper, easier and more practical 
to prevent pollution in the first place than to try to clean contaminated systems later on 
(2). As M. MacGarvin observes (3), the precautionary ideal arises from recognition 
that scientific understanding of ecosystems is complicated by a host of factors, 
including complex and cascading effects of human activities and uncertainty introduced 
by naturally chaotic population dynamics. 


<P>Precaution also serves as a progressive policy tool. The principle addresses a key 
question for environmental managers: how should policies be decided in the face of 
scientific uncertainty? The response from science is to engage in further rigorous 
studies better to understand the hidden workings of nature. But a similar response is 
not available within the culture of policy; in a setting that must cope with demands for 
economic growth, the pressures for resource extraction are immense. So important 
policy decisions (including continuing the status quo) are made despite poor 
knowledge of the ultimate effects of anthropogenic activities; this situation is proving 
increasingly problematic for modern environmental management. 


<P>Precautionary thinking counters traditional regulatory emphasis on 'end of pipe' 
pollution control technologies. Moreover, precaution fundamentally rejects assimilative 
capacity-for instance of the coastal oceans-as a convenient means of (hoped-for) 
dilution. Vague definitions of precautionary action are evolving as it is increasingly 
applied. Initially the principle was put forward in an international setting at the first 
ministerial conference on North Sea pollution in Bremen in 1984 (ref. 4); it was 
strengthened at the second North Sea conference in 1987 (London) and further 
reinterpreted at the third conference in 1990 (The Hague) (1-4). The approach now 
appears in non-marine applications such as regulating pesticides in Africa (Bamako 
Convention, 1990), and efforts to reduce atmospheric contamination (Second World 
Climate Conference, 1990) (5). 


<P>In sum, the emerging precautionary principle could become an important new link 
between science and policy. When first suggested, precautionary action was intended 
mainly to reduce marine contamination due to synthetic chemicals and heavy metals, 
and to halt dangerous activities such as ocean incineration because the burden of 
suspicion made it prudent to prevent such activities (3). In only a few years, preventive 
thinking behind this principle has spread to broader matters (2), and may yet become 
an eloquent step in achieving greener paths of development. Significantly, the United 
States has so far resisted the precautionary concept (1); whether the US position 
evolves towards acceptance of precautionary action will surely have much to do with 
the eventual fate of this rising principle.

<P><B>Hormone Disrupters: Let the precautionary principle 
prevail</B>

<P>Last month, a book was published in the USA: Our Stolen Future, which analyses a 
range of scientific evidence and concludes that certain synthetic chemicals are acting as 
hormone disrupters - causing serious reproductive problems in wildlife and humans. 
Talked about as the next Silent Spring, the book argues that hormone systems are 
being altered by the build-up in the environment and in our bodies of chemicals found 
in pesticides, plastics and industrial pollutants.

<P>The chemical industry is attempting to undermine the scientific evidence and is fighting 
for continued production of all of these chemicals. Greenpeace will  continue to 
provide the business community with data on the existence of realistic alternatives - 
especially for PVC, responsible for two significant hormone disrupters.

<P>The clear message from Our Stolen Future is, however, much broader and more 
fundamental to the way we live and work in an industrial society. The current 
decision making process - supported by business and government - which 
permits industry to use chemicals even when they are suspected of doing damage 
to the environment and human health, must be radically altered.

<P>A new way of thinking, analysing and acting must be introduced. It is called the 
precautionary principle and has been promoted by Greenpeace for many years. It 
requires that preventative action is taken against harmful chemicals.

<P>The precautionary principle has already been enshrined in international protocols 
including the OSPAR Commission in 1992, the North Sea Ministers Conference 
agreement and the UNEP Washington Declaration last November all of which seek to 
eliminate toxic substances.

<P>Neglect of the precautionary principle has already led to global warming and a 
changing climate; holes in the ozone layer over Antarctica and elsewhere; many 
disorders in marine life, such as seals in the North Sea, linked to persistent chemicals 
such as PCBs. Hormone disrupters (which include some PCBs) are simply the latest 
example. Will the industrial stampede to release genetically manipulated organisms into 
the environment be yet another future disaster our children must overcome?

<P>Chemical producers and the scientific community will continue to debate and disagree 
on the specific products and processes which are causing the most hormone disruption. 
For Greenpeace, the larger issue will be how to convince industry to act responsibly.

with permission.
</B>
<P><B>Nobody said we know it all: scientists should admit their fallibility, says David Packham</B>

<P>Last summer, at the eleventh hour, public outcry reversed Shell's decision to sink the 
Brent Spar oil storage buoy. Now there is alarm over the link between BSE in cattle 
and CJD in people. Are we witnessing a loss of faith in science, the triumph of 
ignorance and prejudice? Is there, in the words of the former editor of Nature, John 
Maddox, a needless dereliction of rationality? 

<P>In the dispute between Shell and Greenpeace over the sinking of the Brent Spar, the 
clash was not between rationality and prejudice, but between different rationalities. 
Both were well briefed as to the available scientific evidence, and both argued on the 
basis of that evidence. But there was more to this issue than just plain science. 
According to the economist Milton Friedman, the limit of a company's responsibility is 
to maximise its stockholders' profits. Shell's decision was consistent with market values 
in that it went for the cheap option of sinking the Spar. 

<P>Greenpeace was bound to oppose that decision. Its own priorities were conservation, 
recycling and sustainability. Greenpeace recognised that the existing high levels of 
pollution on the continental shelf were the result of waste disposal policies sanctioned 
by previous scientific opinion. For example the dumping of nuclear waste into shallow 
waters off Alderney in the Channel Islands that took place between 1950 and 1963 
would never be allowed today. And Greenpeace was alarmed at the precedent that 
sinking a redundant oil installation would set. 

<P>The Brent Spar case is an example of a fundamentally scientific issue that could not be 
resolved solely on the basis of scientific or economic criteria. The moral aesthetic and 
cultural questions raised in such cases often have more serious implications for 
humanity. So it is possible for two rational and well-informed groups of people to 
approach the debate from vastly different standpoints. Yet because technical and 
economic arguments appear to yield more objective conclusions, they are still valued 
more highly than what are perceived as nebulous, subjective criteria. 

<P>Some would argue that these subjective dimensions are open to challenge because they 
are arbitrary, whereas science provides clear and final answers. This is the textbook 
approach in the interests of clear teaching, the historical ambiguities are pruned out 
and science is presented as a linear, logical progress. It creates the impression that 
scientists always agree. 

<P>In practice the situation is much more fuzzy. The model of science as a system that 
moves, by force of reason, closer towards a perfect truth has been seriously 
undermined by various developments: the collapse of the certainties of Newtonian 
mechanics, the emergence of chaos theory, and the studies of philosophers such as 
Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. We are now happier to acknowledge that scientists 
commonly disagree, not just about the conclusions but over the nature of experimental 
evidence itself. Conclusions are accepted, not so much because they have been 
"proved", but because they have withstood attempts to falsify them. They are accepted 
provisionally, on a balance of probabilities which does not necessarily command 
unanimous support. 

<P>If this applies to relatively simple, controlled laboratory experiments, how much 
greater must be the uncertainty attached to the vast open-ended questions where 
science impinges on society as a whole - new methods of procreation such as in vitro 
fertilisation, genetic engineering, the applications of information technology, as well as 
a host of environmental issues. 

<P>To assert that science is rational and objective and to denigrate, say, aesthetic 
considerations as mere subjective opinion is to misunderstand science. Scientists do 
their reputation no good to imply they have absolute authority. When "once certain" 
scientific conclusions are shown to be false, people begin to lose faith in all science. 
Neither should scientists allow others to present them or their findings as infallible. 
Much of the damage done to the beef industry by the BSE scare was caused by the 
government proclaiming loudly that "Beef is safe" and suppressing the "ifs" and "buts" 
that would have transformed this into a scientifically acceptable statement. 

<P>Science is rarely beyond debate. We should beware of assertions of the sort "science 
has proved...". They are often employed by politicians and advertisers in an attempt to 
manipulate public opinion, or as a device to bolster a weak argument. 

<P>The way to restore public confidence in science is recognise its fallibility. Different 
"rationalities of traditions" exist, and only by acknowledging these can we begin to 
identify areas of convergence.

<P><B>The Independent, Monday 1 April, 1996.</B>


<P><B>Once the men in white coats held the promise of a better future. Why have 
we lost our trust in them? by John Durant
</B>

<P>Pity the poor scientists who are deliberating over what should be done about BSE. "I 
almost want to crawl into a hole," one was reported as saying last week. "I look at the 
paper and think, my God, we've killed off a 500m export industry. You can't imagine 
what it's like. But we have to make these decisions, and we will." 

<P>Well, I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure that it ought to be scientists alone who make 
these decisions; and I'm not so sure, either, that in the end the biggest victim of mad 
cow disease will be the British beef industry or (heaven forbid) the meat-eating public, 
but rather science itself. Few debates in recent years have exposed scientific expertise 
to the harsh light of public scrutiny quite as BSE has done, and given the way the 
debate seems to be going there is a real possibility that the result will be extremely 
damaging. 

<P>It is only relatively recently that science earned for itself a position of respect in the 
public domain. A little over a century ago, leading scientists like Thomas Huxley and 
John Tyndall fought for favour with a British establishment that was more inclined to 
look to clergymen than to chemists or cosmologists for "expert" judgements on the 
issues of the day. By 1900, science had won the ideological battle for cultural 
recognition - but real political influence didn't come until the experience of world war 
finally convinced the UK that knowledge was a crucial ingredient in industrial and 
military success. 

<P>Those born after the end of the Second World War grew up in a climate of 
extraordinary optimism about science and technology. The decade from 1945 to 1965 
was the heyday of deference to the scientific expert. He (it was almost always he) was 
the architect of astonishing new discoveries - jet-powered aircraft, atomic power, 
antibiotics - which were bound to make the world a better place. Hoping to cash in on 
science's extraordinary success, others aped its methods in supposedly scientific studies 
of everything from parenting (remember all those post-war childcare "experts"?) to 
international politics (much of mathematical game theory came out of cold-war 
strategic studies). 

<P>This was the time when science was generally regarded as the consumer's friend. In the 
early days of commercial advertising on television white-coated experts happily 
endorsed the latest kitchen gadgets, washing powders, toothpaste and patent 
medicines. In the high street, the endorsement of the laboratory scientist was an 
apparently automatic seal of approval, a guarantee that products were not merely new 
but somehow improved. If science said something was good for us, then it was good 
for us. 

<P>Since 1965 several things have conspired to undermine this modernist deference to 
science. For one thing, the instrumental success of science - itself a crucial ingredient in 
the rise of the scientific expert - backfired on the reputation of science, as first the 
disarmament movement rejected nuclear weapons and then the student movement 
resisted the military uses of science and technology in Vietnam. 

<P>Added to this was the growing awareness of the downside of civil R&D in the early 
environmental movement's protest against pesticides and pollution. In the 1950s, civil 
nuclear power had been a symbol of scientific and technological progress; but by the 
1970s it was widely opposed by people who saw it as a symbol of all that was wrong 
with so-called advanced industrial society. 

<P>Today, there is a general sense that we are in transition from modernism to something 
not so easily described but none the less radically different. Terms such as "post-
industrialism" and "post-modernism" refer in part to a less monolithic, more pluralist 
culture in which all of the old certainties - religious, political and scientific - are in 
question. Post-modern culture is altogether less deferential towards experts of all 
kinds: bishops scarcely count any more; politicians are widely vilified; and even 
scientists (the latest and in many ways still the most widely respected authority figures 
in our culture) have a tougher time maintaining their public reputations. In what Ulrich 
Beck calls "the risk society", science is no longer simply regarded as a source of 
solutions; it is increasingly seen as part of the problem. 

<P>The new, more sceptical attitude towards science is all around us. It is apparent, for 
example, in the increasing confidence with which pressure groups such as Friends of 
the Earth and Greenpeace contest scientific evidence on environmental issues; and it is 
equally evident in the increasing assertiveness of the consumer movement. Even in the 
courtroom, traditionally a place where scientific experts were deferred to by judges 
and juries alike, they have had an increasingly rough ride. In the most widely publicised 
trial of modern times, an American jury recently turned its back on the bulk of the 
forensic evidence it had been offered by electing to acquit OJ Simpson. 

<P>This, then, is the context in which British scientists are advising on what to do about 
BSE. Two generations ago, it might conceivably have been possible to regard BSE as 
a reasonably straightforward matter. A new disease of cattle having been diagnosed, 
the possible risks to other cattle and to humans would have been assessed by a panel of 
expert advisers, and appropriate action would have been put in hand by government. 
This, in fact, might pass as a reasonable summary of the present Government's policy. 
The trouble is, though, that we're living in the 1990s, not the 1950s, and a purely 
technocratic approach such as this is no longer creditable. Listening to current 
Government pronouncements about BSE is like living in a time warp; it is as if 30 
years of questioning and criticism had simply not taken place. 

<P>What is wrong with simple deference to the scientific experts  on BSE? First and 
foremost, by their own admission the scientists don't actually know very much about 
BSE. In fact their ignorance of the disease - of its origins, of the nature of the 
infectious agent, or its mode(s) of transmission, or its host range, or its relationship 
with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans - is so great that it is far from clear what 
solid scientific basis there can possibly have been for many of the confident and 
frequently unqualified pronouncements about BSE that have been issued by the 
Ministry of Agriculture over the past few years.

<P>A second problem with deferring to the scientific experts in cases such as these is the 
problematic nature of risk assessment. In Beck's "risk society" risk assessment 
becomes something of a cult. Today, an almost magical aura surrounds the estimation 
of probable harm - despite the fact that for the most part such estimation is a mixture 
of science and speculation. For example, just consider for a moment what is really 
involved in estimating the risk to humans from the infected brains and nervous tissues 
of cows suffering from BSE. At one end of a spectrum of scientificity we have 
measurement of the levels of infectivity in different tissues, and at the other we have 
the daily business of the slaughtering and dismemberment of cattle. What is the 
scientific discipline which delivers safe verdicts concerning the reliable separation of 
risky from non-risky parts of cows? 

<P>Even supposing that BSE itself was better understood and that all the relevant risks 
were reliably calculable, it is far from clear that science alone would provide a 
sufficient basis for public policy. public policy must take account of many things: the 
nature of BSE; the extent of the probable risks: the nature and condition of the beef 
industry; the state of public attitudes and public opinion; and much else besides. At 
best, the scientific advisers who have been in the spotlight over BSE for almost a 
decade are competent to judge only some of these things. Yet at times the Government 
has appeared to lean on these advisers so heavily that the proper boundary between 
scientific and political judgement has been blurred.

<P>* How, in a situation of enormous scientific ignorance and uncertainty, have scientists 
allowed their names and reputations to become firmly attached to unequivocal 
pronouncements by government and industry representatives on the safety of eating 
British beef?

<P>* Why, in a situation where science, industry and public health are all necessarily 
involved, have scientists alone been deemed uniquely competent to pick their way 
through the issues? 

<P>* Why, when public confidence was always to be at least as important as public 
understanding and information, have scientists been left to deliberate the issues in 
private, without benefit even of "public interest" representatives on their expert 
committees? 

<P>Increasing public awareness of the true extent and limitations of scientific ignorance 
and uncertainty is part of our "post-modern" condition; it is part of Beck's "risk 
society". Ideally, the policy-making process should respond to this awareness by 
acknowledging the existence of ignorance and uncertainty and drawing experts, policy-
makers and the public into a mature debate of the issues. 

<P>In the case of BSE, this has signally failed to happen. Instead, we have witnessed the 
old and dismally familiar pattern of bland political reassurance coupled with steadily 
declining public confidence. 

<P>In the present situation, with a major industry under threat and the extent of any public 
health problem still far from clear, it may seem perverse and self-seeking to worry 
about the fate of science. But science is important. For all its imperfections, scientific 
knowledge is an enormously valuable asset. In order to take advantage of this asset, 
however, we depend upon public confidence in science and scientists as credible 
sources of ideas and information in their appropriate areas of expertise. It would be a 
tragedy if the misuse of scientific expertise were to undermine public confidence. That 
way lies know-nothing fundamentalism and, ultimately, the return of barbarism. 

<P>Paradoxically, the salvation of scientific expertise in the public domain lies in a greater 
recognition of the proper limits of science. Our public and political cultures need a 
greater appreciation of what science can and cannot be called upon to do. Such an 
appreciation will come in part from a certain amount of well judged modesty on the 
part of scientists and in part from an opening up of the processes by which scientists 
deliberate and decide on issues such as BSE. The days are gone when scientists could 
expect different rules to apply to them: if they wish their views to command public 
confidence and public respect, then (like everyone else) they must conduct their 
business openly and transparently. 

<P>Without a proper appreciation of the nature and limits of scientific expertise, the public 
are likely to remain caught between undue deference and undue scepticism about 
science. As things are at present, we seem to be moving with alarming rapidity from 
the one to the other.

<P><H3><KBD>Playing the trump card of uncertainty</KBD></H3>


<P>Republicans in the United States are promoting legislation that would insist on scientific risk analysis before any tightening of environmental regulation.  The proposals are not acceptable. 

<P>PUBLICATION last month of studies showing falling sperm counts in British men is a reminder of the insidious threat posed by environmental pollutants.  Not that pollutants are necessarily the source of the falling sperm counts reported over recent years.  Changes in women's lifestyles may also have affected the development of male fetuses, while men's smoking and prolonged driving in tight trousers have also been suggested as possible causes.  The statistics of sperm decline are themselves controversial.  But endocrine-disrupting chemicals affecting fetal testes are prime suspects. 

<P>In assessing the potential impact of such pollutants, the current limitations of science are all too apparent.  When, as with trace chemicals and particulates, low doses may be important, epidemiology becomes important.  But it can accomplish only so much.  True, it can provide useful information at lower levels of exposure than can be explored in laboratory tests on animals; it can also help to relate the results of such tests to effects on humans.  But epidemiologists acknowledge that their studies of human populations can be unavoidably afflicted by statistical uncertainty, because samples sometimes have to be small.  Such factors become important when apparently small consequences of low exposure may amplify the effects of common diseases.  And although progress is being made in understanding mechanisms by which, for example, dioxins may harm humans, the number of possible molecular pathways in such cases is still considerable, while mechanisms are even less well understood for atmospheric particles that are suspected carcinogens. 

<P>Where the issues of pollution have become politicized, uncertainties within the science provide a notorious opportunity for the conflicting parties in any environmental dispute.  That was the case when the chemical industry used its knowledge of atmospheric models to resist restrictions on chlorofluorocarbons, and when Greenpeace and UK Nirex, responsible in the United Kingdom for nuclear waste disposal, use hydrogeological models in disputes over Nirex's plans to test a site for a subterranean repository. 

<P>This week's Briefing focuses on the role of science within two debates which have become even more highly charged: the unprecedented involvement of right-wing politicians in environmental legislation in the United States, exemplified by debates over atmospheric particles; and the extraordinary (but possibly transitory) victory of Greenpeace over the Shell oil company in an environmentally innocuous plan (as it appeared to its originators) to sink an oil storage buoy - the Brent Spar - in deep water off northwest Scotland. 

<P>The common theme is science-based risk analysis.  This can be seen pessimistically as a way of highlighting scientific uncertainties.  After all, a classical risk analysis derives the probabilities of various outcomes by analysing all the possible paths by which each may materialize.  So, for example, in assessing risks to human health from chemically contaminated fish, the US Environmental Protection Agency has presented a framework in which, for just one chemical, estimates of many factors ranging from possible environmental pathways to coefficients of absorption - all uncertain in conceptual terms or in measurement terms or both - have to be amalgamated to make a quantitative risk assessment possible.  The accumulation of uncertainties looks daunting, and provides ample opportunity for groups with vested interests to promote a biased perspective.  But such risk analysis, by assessing scenarios comprehensively, also has valuable potential for establishing common ground. 

<P>Suppose, in the case of Brent Spar, that the environmental impact analyses made by Shell are vindicated by the working group set up by the UK government.  Greenpeace's accusations that Shell's science was deficient would be seen to be exaggerated, and the common ground between the factions might have increased.  But Greenpeace is unlikely to change its position as a result because its overriding principle of environmental precaution in the face of residual scientific uncertainties and future dumping possibilities would still be politically tenable. 

<P>In the United States, Republican zealots and some industries are likely to go on playing the same card of uncertainty and precaution in the opposite direction for as long as they can, while - as the Briefing describes - they propose risk-analysis legislation that would turn that card into a trump.  But their position with respect to particulates is much less defensible than that of Greenpeace on Brent Spar, because the epidemiological evidence is so suggestive of significant risk to the population whereas mechanisms are poorly understood.  The US legislature should reject the demands being made of science before regulatory change.

<P><B>Assessing environmental risks: why science alone is 
not enough</B>

<P><B>Greenpeace Business Feb/March 1996
</B>

<P>Has the public got distorted view of environmental risks? The accumulation of 
scientific facts and risk assessments are no longer sufficient to ensure public 
acceptance over a wide range of issues. For  example: 

<P>the Brent Spar wasnt dumped; 

<P>a prolonged inquiry into Nirexs proposal to build an underground nuclear waste 
dump is taking place in the UK amidst growing public opposition; 

<P>manufacturers and retailers world-wide have yet to convince consumers of the 
benefits of genetically engineered products. 

<P>How should businesses respond when faced with public responses like these which 
they find irrational?  The commonest answer has been to conduct a rational risk 
assessment and add a spoonful of public education to pre-empt emotional responses. 

<P>Decisions will then, it is claimed, be based on science rather than emotion. 
Conventional thinking in government and industry has been that the public is simply 
over emotional, ignorant or both. But there is mounting evidence that it is not a 
misunderstanding of science or the facts on the part of the public which leads to 
conflict on these seemingly technical matters. Research shows that genuine, rational 
and legitimate concerns of the public are illogically excluded from so-called rational, 
scientific risk assessments. The system needs changing if it is to work. 

<P>In the case of the Brent Spar it was impossible to raise the principle of whether 
dumping rubbish at sea was acceptable at all. The framework for decision-making only 
allowed consideration of the particular metalwork of the Brent Spar. In the publics 
mind, however, allowing the dumping of one oil installation could lead to more being 
dumped into the sea in the future. In addition, the fact that the public are urged and 
bound by law not to dump their rubbish in the environment, while an industry was 
treated very differently, was also totally excluded from the decision-making. 

<P>At the inquiry into Nirex's proposed dump, questions about less dangerous sites are 
being avoided. Nirex has created a scientific forum for debate which allows it to 
bypass discussions of safety until a later date, possibly well into the next century, by 
which time the economic momentum behind a dump at Sellafield will be difficult to 
dislodge. 

<P>When it comes to genetic engineering the risk assessment looks at the dangers out of 
context. Crops genetically engineered to be resistant to chemical herbicides are 
assessed in isolation from their intended use with herbicide. Only technical details can 
be debated, not the pros and cons of producing herbicide resistant plants or their 
impact on the use of chemicals. Whether genetic engineering is desirable at all is never 
considered. 


<P><B>PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES
</B>

<P>To the public, the strategy of containing debate inside a narrow so-called rational 
scientific framework acts to exclude legitimate discussion of the issues of public 
policy which lie behind them. The presumptions hiding behind the rational 
approaches in these three cases are that; dumping waste at sea is a positive option; that 
the nuclear industrys short term economic interests are more important than the health 
of future generations; and that risking irreversible change in the genetic make-up of 
nature is an acceptable cost of a new industry. None of these presumptions is founded 
in science. They reflect a particular view of the world which is often at odds with 
public values and perceptions. 

<P>As effective wider debate is not allowed they tend to flare up at unexpected moments, 
as they did with the Brent Spar, when the underlying feelings can get some purchase. 
So they are not expressions of irrational emotion or an anti-science sentiment, but 
symptomatic of deeper divisions between the public and its institutions, including 
business. 

<P>Since none of this is about science, it will not help to provide more scientific facts 
about the impact of dumping the Brent Spar, the hydrogeology of the rocks under 
Sellafield or gene flow from genetically engineered plants. Whilst research also shows 
that the public is interested in, and has confidence in science to address the problems of 
the world, scientific approaches become viewed with suspicion when operating within 
a framework that rules out relevant questions. 

<P>Public education as a response to public anxieties is, therefore, more likely to fuel 
the cynicism with which such exercises are increasingly viewed. People quite sensibly 
evaluate risks partly in terms of whether or not those in control can be trusted and 
what risks they face by having to trust them. PR exercises which result in people being 
patronised as ignorant and irrational are unlikely to reassure the public and lessen the 
sense of risk. 

<P>Following the decision not to dump the Brent Spar, Shell is now investigating some 
200 disposal options. A whole Aladdin's cave of alternatives had been concealed, 
which are now available for business to develop. In contrast, Nirex and the nuclear 
industry will face prolonged, drawn out battles over nuclear waste well into the next 
century if they refuse to address long term safety now. 

<P>Genetic engineering could face the same sorts of battles. Businesses have been 
reluctant to accept labelling of products and have cast off public concerns about the 
morality of genetic engineering as non-scientific. 

<P>Greenpeace will continue to challenge these so called scientific approaches to risk.

<P>Extract from<H2><KBD>Body of Evidence - The effects of chlorine on human health</KBD></H2>Greenpeace report. May 1995<BR> 

 <P>5.1.1<B> Risk Assessment</B>

<P>It is not uncommon for governments to use risk assessment as the basis for setting allowable rates of release for organochlorines. The risk assessment consists of solving a series of mathematical equations that are supposed to represent the physical, chemical and biological behaviour of a toxic chemical: its release from the source; its interactions with wind, rain, heat, light and other environmental factors; its deposition in, movement through and continuing interactions with the environment; its uptake in and movement within the body of a human 'receptor'; and its interactions with and impacts on the many processes taking place within the organs and cells of the human body, including effects such as cancer, that may occur 20-40 years after exposure.

<P>Since many of the chemical's interactions are not  addressed and most of those that are addressed are far from completely characterised, the risk assessment's mathematical equations offer, at best, only very remote approximations of a few of the complex interactions of the chemical in the real world. In addition, many of the numerical factors that are inserted in the array of equations in order to arrive at the final calculation of risk are the products of other remote approximations. For example, one key number is the chemical's carcinogenic potency, which has been known to vary by a factor of 2000, depending on which experimental data are used.

<P>Risk estimates are currently calculated for cancer. Other, more subtle effects such as immune suppression, neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental effects are not addressed. Moreover, sufficient toxicological data for conducting an assessment exists for only about 2 percent of all commercial chemicals.

<P>Like every other method for predicting the future, risk assessment is plagued by lack of essential data and fraught with uncertainties, many of which may never be resolved. As a result, risk estimates derived from this procedure are at least as much matters of opinion as they are matters of science. As described by the former director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:

<P><I>"We should remember that risk assessment data can be like the captured spy: if you torture it long enough, it will tell you anything you want to know."</I>

<H2>GENETIC ENGINEERING AND THE ENVIRONMENT</H2>

Genetic engineering enables scientists to transfer genes between species, for instance from animals to plants and from bacteria to plants or animals. All the boundaries of conventional breeding are broken down. Our understanding of species as distinct from one another will be transcended by the power of the technology.

<P>Many applications of genetic engineering, particularly agricultural, depend on the release of genetically manipulated organisms (GMOs), including plants, animals and microbes, to the environment. How will these organisms, whose genetic makeup has been controlled by man bypassing natural evolution, affect the environment? Will they form the "green" solution to pollution and starvation?  Greenpeace does not believe that genetic engineering will provide the answers to these problems but that new environmental risks will be created while the fundamental problems go unaddressed.

<P>The patenting of genetic material and life forms will not only speed the industrialisation of genetic engineering and therefore the release of GMOs to the environment, but will also put the control of genetic resources into the hands of the multinational industries.

<blockquote>
<H1>10th November 1996: 1st ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO WIWA</H1>

<br><br>
<P> <B>On this, the occasion of the first anniversary of the execution of  
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his fellow activists, Greenpeace woud like to
comment on the context giving rise to this senseless  
tragedy.  The nine activists we remember today were united  
over their concern about the environmental destruction of the Niger delta. 
The oil industry, including but not limited to Royal Du
tch Shell, has for years been and remains the engine of this 
destruction.

 <P>  Relatively few people live in such close proximity to the ravages 
of inadequately controlled and monitored oil development as do the Ogoni
people, but as we now know climate change caused
 by the use of oil and other fossils fuels is  an additional  
environmental menace  to all.

 <P>  Events such as these must spur a rapid conversion from destructive 

to re newable energy and to the building of a sustainable economy.  On this
sombre anniversary, oil exploration is pushing furthe
r into the last remaining frontiers and wilderness areas, into 

fragile ecological areas and into the human environment.  As a rule,  the
easily exploitable oil reserves are gone. As a consequence the
 oil companies are advancing on reserves that were previously viewed 
as inaccessable or off-limits.  These developments come at a time when 
scientific opinion tells us that if we only burn the produ
ction of known oil reserves, and leave existing reserves untouched, 
we could already trigger irreversible and dangerous climate change which
would transform life as we know it.

  <P> In the broader context the activism that occasioned reprisals 
against nine environmentalists from the Niger Delta could be viewed as
another warning to the rest of us.  What is happening in Nigeri
a is in some respects  a repeat of similar ravages caused by oil 
development elsewhere and is mere prelude to tragic events  world-wide.  
More tragedy and pain is inevitable unless  the rest  of us 
stop to  turn our attention to the oil industry, not only in Nigeria 
but around the world, and decide if we can continue to allow our civilization
to be fueled  on destructive and polluting energy so
urces.
   
<P> In 1992, at the  Earth Summit in Brazil, governments  agreed on and 
pledged commitment to the goal of stablizing and then reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases below dangerous levels. This was base
d on scientific estimates that a cut of greenhouses gases of 60-80% 
would be necessary to prevent potentially dangerous climate change. If this
commitment is to be honored and a response to  the thre
at of global climate change realized, we must forego the development 
of even the known oil fields and seek to develop solar and other energy
forms, many of which are already cost-effective.


        <P>    Why in this context, should a conflict between the oil 
industry and people whose land unfortunately sits on top of an oil field
persist to the point of tragedy?  Moreover, what justificat

ion is there for Shell and other multinational oil companies to fail, 
as they have in Nigeria, to even meet the environmental standards imposed on
the industry in their home countries?

    <P>   The foregoing calls into question whether continued oil 
development in Nigeria can be justified.  If, however, Shell continues to
operate in Nigeria, Greenpeace calls for the following:  

<P>1. &nbspIn addition to the current Niger Delta Environmental Survey (NDES) 
a full and independent international inquiry into Shell's and other oil
companies' operations in Nigeria to determine whether the
y comply with the environmental laws of Nigeria and the standards of 
the industry prevalent in Europe and North America.  

<P>2.  &nbspShell's public commitment to operate under the highest standards 
imposed on the industry worldwide.    

<P>3. &nbsp Shell's public condemnation of the execution of environmental 

activists and insistance on the immediate release of all environmental
activists still confined as a result of acts of conscience.  

<P>4.   &nbsp Publication  by  Nigeria and all other  fossil fuel producing 
countries of the total  annual  greenhouse gases which  result from the
production of  oil, gas and other fossil fuels  each year,  

and as a proportion of global emissions.  </B>

<H1>KEN SARO-WIWA'S CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE NIGERIAN MILITARY
APPOINTED TRIBUNAL</H1>
<p align=center><H4>Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria</H4>
<p align=center><a href="ken.gif"><img src="kent.gif width=74 height=76> 99kb Gif</a><a href="ken.jpg">26kb Jpeg</a>
<p><H1>My lord,</H1>

<p>We all stand before history.  I am a man of peace, of ideas. 
Appalled by the denigrating poverty of my people who live on a
richly endowed land, distressed by their political
marginilization and economic strangulation, angered by the
devestation of their land, their ultimate heritage, anxious to
preserve their right to life and to a decent living, and
determined to usher to this country as a whole a fair and just
democratic system which protects everyone and every ethnic group
and gives us all a valid claim to human civilization, I have
devoted my intellectual and material resources, my very life, to
a cause in which I have total belief and from which I cannot be
blackmailed or intimidated.  I have no doubt at all about the
ultimate success of my cause, no matter the trials and
tribulations which I and those who believe with me may encounter
on our journey.  Nor imprisonment nor death can stop our ultimate
victory.
<p><a href="ken2.gif"><img src="ken2t.gif width=72 height=46> 109kb Gif</a> <a href="ken2.jpg"> 38kb Jpeg</a> 
<p>I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues
are not the only ones on trial.<p><a href="#shell">  Shell is here on trial</a> and it
is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding
a watching brief.  The Company has, indeed, ducked this
particular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons
learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my
mind that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the
Delta will be called to question sooner than later and the crimes
of that war be duly punished.  The crime of the Company's dirty
wars against the Ogoni people will also be punshed.
<p><a href="ken3.gif"><img src="ken3t.gif width=72 height=46> 64kb Gif</a> <a href="ken3.jpg"> 19kb Jpeg</a> 
<p>On trial also is the Nigerian nation, its present rulers and
those who assist them.  Any nation which can do to the weak and
disadvantaged what the Nigerian nation has done to the Ogoni,
loses a claim to independence and to freedom from outside
influence.  I am not one of those who shy away from proesting
injustice and oppression, arguing that they are expected in a
military regime.  The military do not act alone.  They are
supported by a gaggle of politicians, lawyers, judges, academics
and businessmen, all of them hiding under the claim that they are
only doing their duty, men and women too afraid to wash their
pants of urine.  We all stand on trial, my lord, for by our
actions we have denigrated our Country and jeapordized the future
of our children.  As we subscribe to the sub-normal and accept
double standards, as we lie and cheat openly, as we protect
injustice and oppression, we empty our classrooms, denigrate our
hospitals, fill our stomachs with hunger and elect to make
ourselves the slaves of those who ascribe to higher standards,
pursue the truth, and honour justice, freedom, and hard work.  
I predict that the scene here will be played and replayed by
generations yet unborn.  Some have already cast themselves in the
role of villains, some are tragic victims, some still have a
chance to redeem themselves.  The choice is for each individual. 

<p>I predict that the denoument of the riddle of the Niger delta
will soon come.  The agenda is being set at this trial.  Whether
the peaceful ways I have favoured will prevail depends on what
the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out to the waiting
public.
 
In my innocence of the false charges I face Here, in my utter
conviction, I call upon the Ogoni people, the peoples of the
Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria to
stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their
rights.  History is on their side.  God is on their side.  For
the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41:"All those that fight
when oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah shall punish the
oppressor."  Come the day.

<H3>GREENPEACE DISRUPTS SHELL RECEPTION AT ART GALLERY</H3>
<p>Activists Climb Building And Hang Modern Work Of Art To Protest 
Shell Oil's Support of Nigerian Military Government 
 
<p><font size=+1>WASHINGTON, January 24</font> -- Greenpeace activists today forced Shell
Oil to cancel a planned dinner reception at the Phillips
Collection art gallery in Washington, and added their own work
of art to the museum, unfurling on the outside of the building
a 7 x 14 foot rendition of Edvard Munch's expressionistic "The
Scream" with a modern message: "Stop Shell In Nigeria."   

<p>While environmental, human rights, labor and Nigerian activists
were demonstrating outside the gallery, two Greenpeace activists
climbed over the side of the gallery's roof two stories
up and descended several feet to display the large painting.  

<p>"We are here today to tell Shell to clean up its act and not
simply its corporate image," said Greenpeace's Steve Kretzmann
in Washington. "As we have learned from dealing with South Africa
in the 1980s, the best way to change an oppressive regime is for
corporations to pull out and stop the flow of money. We must
boycott Nigerian oil and get Shell out of Nigeria."
 
<p>As the demonstration began, Shell cancelled the PR dinner for top
journalists, congress members and lobbyists. The dinner was
apparently an attempt by Shell to retrieve its ailing public
image.

<p>Greenpeace is part of the International Roundtable on Nigeria,
a broad coalition of human rights, environmental, labor, and
religious organizations calling for an immediate oil embargo
against Nigeria to isolate the brutal dictatorship of Sani
Abacha. Shell's collusion with the Nigerian regime in last
November's execution of nine Nigerian activists, including Nobel-
prize nominated writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, has spurred worldwide
condemnation of Shell, and driven South African President Nelson
Mandela to spearhead the call for an oil embargo. 
 
<p>Dr. Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro-Wiwa, arrived in the United
States January 24.  He will be travelling to New York,
Washington, Toronto, and San Francisco to document human rights
and environmental abuses in his Ogoni homeland at the hands of
the Nigerian government and international oil companies. 
According to Dr. Wiwa, Shell offered to negotiate Ken Saro-Wiwa's
release from a Nigerian prison if international protests were
called off. 
 
<p>Oil accounts for over 90% of Nigeria's exports and 80% of
government revenues, and Shell produces fully half of Nigeria's
total oil output. Sadly, many local communities have suffered
environmental damage from Shell's drilling and production
activities. Of the 110 countries in which Shell operates, nearly
40% of the company's oil spills and leakages occured in Nigeria.

<CENTER><H3>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
		
<P>THE EUROPEAN UNION FAILS TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES AGAINST NIGERIA: GREENPEACE</H3></center>
		
		BRUSSELS, 6 December 1995 -- The European Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday clearly recognised that the situation in Nigeria requires international action. However, they have stopped short of applying the only measure that would have any effect - an oil embargo against Nigeria.<p>
		<p>
		The European Union agreed to a series of visa restrictions, the expulsion of Nigerian military personnel from the European Union and limiting sporting contact.  None of these measures send a strong enough message from the international community to the Nigerian government and Shell.<p>
		<p>
		"Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were executed as a result of their campaign against the environmental destruction of their homeland by Shell," said Paul Horseman of Greenpeace International, "Despite its strong condemnation of the executions and the Nigerian dictatorship, the international community has not taken any real action, instead they have said business as usual."<p>
		<p>
		In January, the trials of 19 more activists are scheduled to begin in Nigeria.  They face the same charges and penalty as Ken Saro-Wiwa.  The activists are in jail because they have been campaigning against the environmental devastation of their homeland by the oil industry - predominatly Shell.<p>
		<p>
		"The Nigerian regime will stop at nothing to ensure that the oil production continues, hence an oil embargo is the only real measure which sends the right message to both industry and to Abacha's regime." added Horseman<p>

<CENTER><H1>MOVEMENT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE OGONI PEOPLE (MOSOP)


<P>19 MORE OGONIS FOR THE JUSTICE AUTA SPECIAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL</H1></center>

MOSOP wishes to inform the general public in Nigeria and the international community that charges have now been formalised for the arraignment of 19 more Ogonis before the sol-called Ogoni Civil Disturbances Special Military Tribunal, in January 1996.<p>

Names of the detainees are contained in Charge no. OCDT/PH/3/95, dates 18/9/95 and are as follows:-<p>
1.  Bariture Bano Lebee, <BR>
2.  John Banatu<BR>
3.  Babina Vizor<BR>
4.  Pogbgara Zorzor<BR>
5.  Friday Gburuma<BR>
6.  Yedah Naasikpo<BR>
7.  Paul Deekor<BR>
8.  Elijah Lekie Badom<BR>
9.  Blessing Israel<BR>
10. Taagalo K. Monsi<BR>
11. Kagbara Basseh<BR>
12. Adam Kaa<BR>
13. Sampson Ntignee<BR>
14. Godwin Gbodoo<BR>
15. Samuel Asigha<BR>
16. Nwinbari Papa<BR>
17. Benjamin Kabari (alias Monday Kabari)<BR>
18. Baribuma Kumanwe<BR>
19. Ngbaa Baovi<BR>


<P>MOSOP wishes to note that although Taagalo Monsi (10), Ngbass Baovi (19) and Baribuma Kumannwe (18) were arrested in the last week of October and first arraigned in a magistrate's court on Friday, Octoboer, 27 1995, their names are curiously contained in a charge dated 18/9/95. Again. while Michael Dogara was arrested, arraigned and detained with them (27/11/95) he is not on the charge list because they found out he comes from Bodo, thenative town of late Chief Edward Kobani.<p>

MOSOP also wished to draw attention to the fact that Mr Adam Kaa had actually been in detention in the bori camp cal since March 1995 for some other matter before the May 21, 1995 suspects were brought in there but was erroneosly taken to the BIIB cell where he was surprisingly "identified" by Alhaji Kobani during an identification parade there. These errors were pointed to Major Paul Okuntimo who ignored the plea.<p>

The witch hunting of Saro-Wiwas MOSOP members, youths, chiefs and elders alike  have been itensified  in the bid to leave no trace of activism in Ogoni.<p>
MOSOP calls on all men of goodwill at home and abroad to put pressure on government to disband the military tribunal which has now been left in place specifically for the Ogonis. You must act to prevent further judicial murders in Ogoni.<p>

Durnu Sakaar, Secretary, MOSOP Crisis Management Committee.  <p>

<p align=center><H1>KEN SARO WIWA AND 8 OGONI PEOPLE EXECUTED:  BLOOD ON SHELL'S HANDS</H1>

<p>London--10 November 1995--The blood of Ken Saro-Wiwa will permanently stain the name
of Shell, Greenpeace said today in response to the news that Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
Ogoni were, according to widespread rumours, hanged this morning in Port Harcourt,
Nigeria.
 
<p>"Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged today for speaking out against the environmental damage to
the Niger Delta caused by Shell Oil through its 37 years of drilling in the region.  Ken Saro
Wiwa was campaigning for what Greenpeace considers the most basic of human rights:  the
right for clean air, land and water.  His only crime was his success in bringing his cause to
international attention," said Thilo Bode, Executive Director of Greenpeace International.   

<p>Greenpeace warned that any protest in the Niger Delta today, non violent or otherwise,
would likely be met with military force and further massacres.  Bode appealed to General
Sani Abacha to let the Ogoni people voice their grief without fear of violence and further
deaths. 
 
<p>Shell's call for "quiet diplomacy" in the 11th hour following the confirmation of the death
sentence by the Nigerian Ruling Council has a hollow ring.  Shell had ample opportunity to
demonstrate concern over the 17 months of Ken's incarceration and trial.  They chose to
maintain their cosy relationship with the military dictatorship to secure oil profits rather than
condemn, the brutal and unjust arrest and later sentencing of non-violent environmental
campaigners.
 
<p>"If Shell and the Nigerian military think that the hanging of Saro-Wiwa has removed national
and international outrage, they're wrong.  Greenpeace today reaffirms its dedication to
continue the campaign against environmental destruction by the oil industry," said Mr Bode.

<p>In his closing address to the tribunal,  Saro-Wiwa stated
"I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. 
Shell is here on trial and it is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a
watching brief. The Company has, indeed, ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely
come and the lessons learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my mind
that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the Delta will be called to question
sooner than later and the crimes of that war be duly punished.  The crime of the Company's
dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished." 
 
<p>"In my innocence of the false charges I face here, in my utter conviction, I call upon the
Ogoni people, the peoples of the Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria
to stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their rights.  History is on their side. 
God is on their side.  For the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41:"All those that fight
when oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah  shall punish the oppressor. Come the day."

<TITLE>GREENPEACE CALLS ON SHELL TO CONDEMN NIGERIAN DEATH SENTENCES </TITLE>

<p align=center><H2>GREENPEACE CALLS ON SHELL TO CONDEMN NIGERIAN DEATH SENTENCES
</H2>
<p align=center><a href="ken.jpg">26kb Jpeg</a><a href="ken.gif"><img src="kent.gif width=74 height=76> 99kb Gif</a>



<p>London--8 November 1995--Greenpeace today called on Shell
International to publicly condemn the death sentences imposed on
Nigerian environmentalists by a military tribunal. 


<P>Today the Nigerian Ruling Council agreed to accept the military
tribunal's ruling that Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other Ogoni should
be sentenced to death by hanging -- for murders they did not
commit.  It is understood from sources in the Niger Delta that
military are looking for a "secret location" in which to carry
out the hangings -- which could now happen any time. Ken Saro-
Wiwa and the other nine remain in the Bori military camp but
could be moved to this location and hanged any time. 

<P>"It is extraordinary that Governments right around the world have
condemned the death sentences of the Ogoni people but Shell,
which has actually been working in Ogoniland, has not offered a
single word of regret," said Paul Horsman of Greenpeace
International. 

<P>More than 14% of Shell's worldwide oil production comes from
Nigeria. 

<P>As a major investor in Nigeria, and as a company which depends
on the rule of law and stability in the countries where it
operates Shell cannot and should not stay silent when a
country's constitution is so clearly breached, with such violent
and unjust consequences, as has happened in this case. 

<P>One of the main reasons that Ken Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni
leaders are now facing the death penalty is because of their
campaigns against the environmental devastation caused by the oil
industry in general and Shell in particular.  

<P>Greenpeace calls on Shell International's chairman, John
Jennings, to publicly state his unambiguous opposition to
environmental activists of any sort being targeted through unjust
and unconstitutional means, as has happened in this case.

<P>In the USA, a Greenpeace demonstration is currently underway at
the Shell headquarters in Washington DC (I Street). 

<P>"With profitablity comes responsibility and Shell should use
their undoubted influence on the Nigerian authorities to stop the
tragic deaths of Ken Saro Wiwa and the Ogoni.  Furthermore, Shell
should state that they will operate in Nigeria to the same
standards and requirements for their best practice world-wide. 
If they cannot do this then they should leave Nigeria," said
Horsman.

<H1>GREENPEACE OCTOBER 31ST PRESS RELEASE</H1>
<p><font size=+1>London--31 October 1995</font>--Shell Oil must share responsibility for
Nigerian author and environmentalist Ken Saro Wiwa's death
sentence, Greenpeace said today. 

<p>Saro Wiwa, 56, has received international awards for his work on
the Ogoni peoples' peaceful campaign to expose and oppose the
devastation caused by Shell's drilling in the Niger Delta.  His
sentence today comes at the end of a 17-month incarceration in
Nigerian military prisons, and a trial before a military tribunal
not recognised in the Nigerian legal system.

<p>"Ken Saro-Wiwa has received the death sentence today because he
and the Ogoni people have exposed the devastation wrought on
their land by Shell. If this bizarre sentence is carried out,
Shell shares responsibility for the death of Ken Saro Wiwa," said
Paul Horsman of Greenpeace International. 
 
<p>Yesterday, five Ogoni imprisoned with Ken received the death
sentence yesterday, and four more today.  There were 28 Ogoni
imprisoned and on trial with Ken Saro-Wiwa.  At least four have
died in prison this year. 

<p>More than 30 years of Shell's oil operations have resulted in
appalling environmental degradation in Nigeria.  The standards
Shell applies to its Nigerian operations would not be permitted
in Europe or North America.   

<p>Saro Wiwa's death sentence was given by a military tribunal
widely slated by human rights groups and lawyers.  In May last
year he was arrested and accused of inciting the murder of four
Ogoni elders.  The only two prosecution witnesses who said during
the trial that Saro Wiwa told his followers to carry out the
murders later swore affidavits alleging Shell had bribed them to
give evidence [1].  

<p>In August,  the defence legal team quit the trial, saying the
military tribunal was not an objective body to hear the case.
There is no appeal against the ruling,  which will be sent
straight to General Abacha, who will decide on the dates of the
death sentences.   

<p>"Due to Shell's oil operations in the Niger Delta, the Ogoni
people have lost their farmlands, fisheries and livelihood. 
Following demonstrations against Shell, the Ogoni have been
massacred, tortured and gagged by the Nigerian military. Shell's
appalling environmental double standards are to blame for the
plight of the Ogoni people and Ken Saro Wiwa's death sentence
today," said Horsman. 
 
<p>According to Shell's latest review, Nigeria remains the one of
the most important sources of Shell's equity oil production [2]. 
 
<p>Over the past week, military action against the Ogoni people has
been stepped up, with reports that over 2000 troops moved into
Ogoniland at the weekend, and are now carrying out arbitrary
arrests. 
 
<p>"With profitability comes responsibility; hence Greenpeace
demands that Shell, one of Nigeria's largest creditors, to appeal
to General Abacha against this barbaric sentence and save the
lives of Ken Saro Wiwa and the condemned Ogoni," said Horsman.
"If Shell allow Ken Saro Wiwa to die, the international community
will know who to blame."

<html><head><title>SHELL ADMITS IMPORTING GUNS FOR NIGERIAN POLICE.
 By Cameron Duodu</title></head>

<H2>SHELL ADMITS IMPORTING GUNS FOR NIGERIAN POLICE. </H2>
<p>OBSERVER    28.1.96.  by Cameron Duodu




<p>Shell, the multinational oil giant, has admitted importing
weapons into Nigeria to help arm the police.
The company revealed to the Observer that the weapons are to help
protect its oil installations. However, activists accuse Shell
of arming the death squads who have been brutally suppressing the
Ogoni people.
<p>The admission come in the wake of reports in Nigerian newspapers
that Shell place tenders in Nigeria for the importation of arms.
<p>Eric Nickson, a spokesman for Shell international, said: "Shell
has purchased sidearms handguns on behalf of the Nigerian
police force who guard Shell's facilities. But once imported, the
arms remain the property of the Nigerian police, who store, guard
and use them." He added: "The Nigerian police do not sufficient
funds to equip themselves... We purchase the weapons on their
behalf. But Shell does not have arms itself."
<p>Shell would not say where the arms were being imported from, nor
how many are involved. Mr Nickson said the practice is carried
out by a "wide range of companies in Nigeria, who employ the
police to guard their facilities."
<p>But a highly respected Chief of Defence Staff in Nigeria,
Lieutenant General Alani Akinrinade, said: "The Nigerian police
are well equipped and do not need anyone to import arms for
them."
<p>Pointing out that the Nigerian police have "their mobile force,
who are armed to the teeth", he added: "There is no excuse for
any one to have a private army in Nigeria. They don't need it."
<p>Shell's admission will confirm the worst fears of the Ogoni
people of South Eastern Nigeria, who have been accusing it of
acting in collusion with the Nigerian government's security
agencies. Ogoni people have killed and maimed while protesting
against the environmental devastation of Ogoni lands. Shell
pulled out of the Ogoni area in 1993.
<p>In 1990 the mobile police whose nickname in Nigeria is the Kill 
and Go Mob killed 15 people in the village of Umuechem, where
Shell installations were being attacked by villagers angry at the
pollution.
<p>Human rights abuses by Nigeria's military regime have meant that
limited sanctions, which include a ban on military hardware, were
strengthened after the execution of the playwright Ken SaroWiwa
and eight other activists on 10 November.
<p>Among those call for inquiries into Shell's importation  of arms
into Nigeria are the respected academic, Professor Claude Ake,
and Dr Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Sar0 Wiwa. Professor Ake called
on the Nigerian government to institute an official inquiry.
In an address to the Cooperation and Development Committee of the
European Commission in Brussels, Dr Owens Wiwa asked the
commission for help in ending Shell's "illegal purchase of arms
into Nigeria."
<p>Professor Ake brought attention to a court case, pending before
a Lagos High Court in which Shell Nigeria is being sued by a
Nigerian arms importing company, Humanitiex Nigeria Limited for 
$1.2 million for "a breach of contract." over arms the company
was supposed to import for Shell in 1993. The case was reported
in Lagos's This Day last month.
<p>Mr Nickson said Shell had filed a defence in the Nigerian court,
stating that "no contract was drawn up with Humanitiex, in
respect of any arms, ammunition or communications equipment".

<H2>'Shell axes 'corrupt' Nigeria staff- Times- Insight Team- 17th December'</H2>



<p>SHELL the international oil  gaint, is planing a purge of  executives in Nigeria following the  discovery of a  'black hole of corruption"  involving the payment of millions  of dollars in bribes and kick backs   to tribal  chiefs community and  the military in the troubled Ogoni  region.
	<p>An Insight investigation by  uncovered serious allegations of  corruption against  Shell claim  including the claim that a senior  army officer, accused of ordering  the murder and torture of Ogoni dissidents, was on Shell's  payroll. 
	<p>Shell, the largest foreign oil  company in Nigeria  has repeatedly denied any involvement in  its politics The company was heavily criticised  for Its role  in the country after the execution  last month of Ken Saro Wiwa and  eight other prominent Ogoni  activists.
	<p>But documents from Shell the  military and government source  obtained by The Sunday Times  indicated aa close relationship  between local br anches of the otl  comp any and General Sani  Abacha 's  brutal military regime. 
	<p>The most damaging claim is that      Shell officials paid Lieutenant  Colonel Paul Okuntimo, who was  responsible for crushing civil  unrest in Ogoniland     and  opposition to Shell's presence.   Okuntimo  is accused of waging s campaign of murder,  rape and torture throughout  Ogoniland. In a memo memo to the  administrator   of Rivers State  Okuntimo urged "wasting sting  operations   coupled  with  psychological  tactics of displacement against Ogonis. He advised  "Shell operations still impossible  unless ruthless military operations  are undertaken for smooth  economic activities to  commence".
	<p>Interviewed by The Sunday  Times    in Nigeria  last  week, Okuntimo initially admitted  being paid by in while he was in ch  arge of crushing Ogoni protests  against   the company "Shell  contributed to the logistics  through fin ancial support To do  that, web needed resources and  Shell provided these," he added.  He later denied the comments
	<p>The evidence against him is  supported by   conversation    between Okuntimo and Nick  Ashton-Jones a british  environmentalist and Oronto  Douglas a Nigerian  journalist,  in June last year. Ashton-Jones   who had worked for Shell in  eastern Nigeria said the colonel,  then a major, felt badly let down  by Shell.
	<p>Ashton-Jones recalled "he said  he was doing a wonderful job for  the government and he was  disappointed tha t Shell had  stopped pa ying him He sa id that  everything he was doing was for  Shell " Douglas published his account of the meeting three
days later corroborating Ashton-Jones   views. 	<p>Ledum Mittee, the lawyer who  stood trial with Saro-Wiwa and was  the only defendant acquitted, built  up a close relationship with  Okuntimo during his detention. Mittee said "He admitted he was being  paid by Shell. He said he was angry  with Shell because  they were no  longer pa ying as much for the  upkeep of his boys. He felt they were  not grateful enough " Mittee explained that Shell provided vehicles for military  operations and rewarded Okuntimo  personally. 
	<p>Brian Anderson, managing  director of Shell Nigeria, who has pledged to clean up the company's  opera tions said of Okuntimo: "From what I hear of his recent past he is a  fairly brutal person. I'd like to know if  we were involved with somebody  like that so we could stamp it out "
	<p>A Shell report  on its Nigreian operations, written by  independent auditors, highlight  the role played by Steve Lawson-Jack, head of Shell's public and  governmental affairs in the eastern  region and the man cited by Mittee  and as  the link with Okuntimo.
<p> Lawson-Jack  , who has 
been on
leave for six weeks,is   held   "culpable"  by the auditors for his part in arranging  N1m  (S0,0001 compensation    claim  against the company   for a bogus oil spill. Yesterday he denied any wrongdoing "I have no personal links with Okuntimo but my job sometimes involves meeting government personnel," he added.
	<p>Anderson said he was  considering Lawson-Jack's future.  He said 20 Shell employees could  be dismissed as a result of internal  investigations."It's Iike a black hole of corruption,  acting that like  gravitythat  is  pulling us down all the time " A  
European Shell executive who wanted to remain anonymous sa id "I would go so far   as to  say that   we spent more money on  bribes and corruption than on on  community development protects." 	<p>The picture that emerges from the  Insight investigation b of a company  that let whole sections of its  operations rampant. While Shell International cites a  figure of 125rn a  year spent on community its  by its Nigerian subsidiary   much of  this money ended up in the  pockets of Shell officials,  community leaders and military  officers.
<p>The role of Lawsonjack and his department is increasingly under scrutiny "Shell, through Steve  Lawson-Jack gave me every  opportunity to become  a small  millionaire said Saturday Kpakol,an  Ogoni community leader. Kpakol detailed how in 1990, as an  unemployed teacher, he set up a pressure group called Council for Concerned Indigents in order to try  to cut a deal with Shell.

	<p>"We had a series of meetings with Lawson-Jack detailing demands such asproviding water to our village, equipping our health centre and  providing us withscholarships. Then in  1992 we joined up ~with Mos op {the movement for the Survival of Ogoni People} and stopped some Shell operations"  he said "Lawson-Jack called me to come and gave me a contract form, saying why don't you forget about these protests and join us. He offeredto give me a contractfor N1Million to install waterpipes outside the village. He said it would only cost N500,000 and we could split the difference"

	<p>Anderson insisted that Shell had  not sought military or police  protection for its workers since 1990.

	<p>But Precious Omuku, head of  public relations for Shell in eastern  Nigeria, admitted the company had called for military protection in  Ogoniland in 1993 and approved a  request from one  of the  company'scontractors to seek the  protection of Okuntimo's men for  workers laying a pipeline.
<p>A memo from J. Udofia, then Shell general manager east, to the state governor, makes a request for 'the usual assistanc' in restoring order. Omuku admits that in Ogoniland this inevitably led to the involvement of the military. 

<p>A spokesman for Shell in London said:"Shell Nigeria has not authorised any financialsupport to the military. If there is any evidence that it has happened, we will look at it"

<H2>' 0il bringing untold damage to Niger delta'- By Geoffrey Lean Environment Correspondent </H2>

<p>OIL HAS brought little but misery to the people of the Niger delta, an authoritative new report reveals.

	<p>The report - which provides heavyweight backing for the protests of the executed writer and environmentalist Ken SaroWiwa -describes in devastating detail how oil production has ruined the area, while leaving the local people poorer and sicker even than other Nigerians.

	<p>It also explodes the oil companies' claim - much repeated by Shell in the row that has followed the killing of Saro-Wiwa and eight fellow Ogoni activists in November - that they have improved the lives of the people by investing in local cornmunities. It says the impact of these initiatives has been "minimal"

	<P>The report - by World Bank environment specialist David Moffat and Professor Olof Linden of Stockholm University says that even official statistics suggest that every year the delta is polluted by 2.3 billion cubic metres of oil from some 300 separate spills, almost one a day, but that the true Sure may be 10 times higher.  It confirms a report in the Independent on Sunday last month that gas flaring from oil production in the area emits some 35 million tons of carbon dioxide and 12 million tons of methane a year, making it the world's largest single contributor to global warming.

	<p>Shell, which produces more than half of Nigeria's oil, has countered condemnation of pollution by pointing out that the death has many other environmental problems, such as overpopulation and {and degradation. But the report published in Ambio, the magazine of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences adds that many of these have been made worse by oil production.

	<p>It says that population growth, swelled by large scale immigration as a result of oil development, is so rapid that food production will have to double in just 20 years if the people ate to remain even as poorly fed as they are today. Yet the industry is helping to destroy the natural resources on which agriculture depends.

	<p>Building canals and roads, largely to service the industry, has precipitated some of the most extensive environmental degradation in the region", the report says. Oil company and government roads block streams and flood plains, creating stagnant ponds of water, killing forests and flooding fields They also give loggers better access to the area's fast-diminishing forests. 

	<p>The report adds that income in the area is below the national average, while health is substantially worse" than in the rest of south-east Nigeria. Tests have found 85 per cent of drinking water samples polluted by sewage, and largely as a result water-related diseases account for four-fifths of all the illness.

	<p>Although oil provides more than 80 per cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange the report says nearly three~quarters of the people of the Delta live in ruralSaro  communities characterised by a lack of development, stagnant agricultural productivity negligible opportunities in urban areas, rapid population growth and tenuous property rights".

	<P>It ascribes the social unrest that led to the execution of Ken Saro Wiwa to 'resentment of the marginalisation of the local communities in contrast to the value of the oil resources".
<p><li> The Royal Geographical Society has voted to dump Shell as one of its sponsors because of its activities in Nigeria At its annual conference on Friday, members  of the 160-year-old society voted by 157 to 10 to remove -Shell as one of its four corporate patrons because of disquiet over the company's environmental and political record.

- Environment 
Correspondent</H2>

<p>"RUTHLESS  military operations"were proposed specifically to help Shell establish stability in its oil business in Nigeria, a confidential memorandum obtained by the Independent on Sunday reveals. It recommends "wasting vocal individuals" 
	<p>The internal state security memorandum, which is marked "restricted" 12 times, says that regular financial "inputs" from oil companies had been discussed. A British environmentalist said yesterday that the author of the document had told him that his men had been paid by Shell to protect installations.

	<p>Others confidential indicate that Shell asked for armed "assistance" against local demonstrators. And a leading Nigerian yesterday accused the company of "militarising commerce in his country".
<p>Shell admits asking for help
from armed police but strenuously denies paying the military. It says that there have been instances where the Nigerian authorities have "gone too far" and insists that it "does not wish to operate behind military shields".

	<P>But the disclosure of the documents will greatly increase the international row that has followed the execution of the writer and environmentalist Ken SaroWlwa and eight fellow Ogoni activists last month, and will step up pressure on the multinational company to leave- Nigeria. '

	<p>The memorandum, headed "Law and Order in Ogoni etc" and dated 12 May 1994, is to the Military Administrator of Rivers State from the Chairman of Internal Security, Major Paul Okuntimo. It notes: "Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic activities to commence." Under the heading "recommendations Major Ok untimo lists "wasting operations during MOSOP and other gatherings making constant military presence justifiable". (MOSOP IS the Movement for the Survival of  the Ogoni People, to which Ken Saro-Wiwa belonged.)
	<p>He goes on to recommend: "Wasting targets cutting across communities and leadership cadres especially vocal individuals and "wasting operations coupled with psychological tactics of displacement/wasting as noted above."  Under the heading "financial implications (estimates/funding the memorandum lists "pressure on oil companies for prompt regular inputs as discussed". Major  Okuntimo estimated that there would have lo be an "initial disbursement of 50 million naira as advanced allowances to officers and men, and for logistics to commence operations with immediate effect, as agreed".

	<p>Yesterday Nick Ashton-Jones, a British environmentalist, said that Major Okuntimo had told him and a Nigerian lawyer, Oronto Douglas, in June 1994 that he was carrying out his operations for Shell and that he was unhappy because the company had stopped paying his men. Mr Ashton-Jones, who says he was arrested by Okuntimo and beaten on his orders, said that the remark "had stuck in our minds because this was something that we had suspected".

	<p>He says that he has no real doubt that the company had been paying the major, but this
remark is the only evidence he has for it. 
	<p>Shell said yesterday that it was compelled by law to inform the authorities when there was a threat to oil installations and that : it only called in the police when its facilities or staff were at risk, It agreed there had been "instances where the response by the authorities has gone too far with tragic consequences", but added: "The level of response that a country's authorities carry out . . . has got to be a matter for those authorities." The company added: "We categorically refute that any form of input was ever provided to the military; neither would we do so if approached on such a matter."At the end of the day dialogue and cooperation and goodwill between people is the only way forward.

<h2>Shell signs 22 5 billion Nigerian contract- Daily Telegraph- 16th December 1995</h2>
<p>SHELL is to go ahead with a .;multi-million-pound gas project in Nigeria, defying international pressure to halt the
scheme in the wake of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa,  the political activist. Announcing the signing of the contract yesterday, Brian Anderson, managing direct itor of Shell Petroleum Company of Nigeria, said: "We recognise there have been calls for the project to be halted as a gesture of politi cal protest. We respect these views and understand the concerns they reflect. But we cannot accept that this would contribute to the good of Nigeria. Shell is  a 25-6 per cent shareholder in the 2.5 billion lion construction contract for the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Project.

	<p>Mr Anderson said that the scheme would bring "great and measurable benefits" to Nigerians,  including the environmental benefit of a reduction in the need to "flare" gas.

	<p>Shell says that up to now there has been no other way to dispose of large volumes of the gas produced with the oil of the Delta region. The company says that the collapse of the project, which has taken almost 30 years to -devise, would have meant the collapse of inter-dependent contracts. About 6,000
jobs would be created locally during the construction phase and many more permanent jobs would be created to operate the plant dur ing its 30-year Life. 

	<p>The executions of Mr Saro-Wiwa and eight others last month was condemned by the international community and Shell came under pressure to withdraw from Nigeria. The company was involved in controversy earlier this year over the proposed deep
sea disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform in the north Atlantic. 

	<p>After a campaign by Greenpeace and other environmental groups, opposition from European governments and threats of consumer boycotts, Shell backed down.-PA
<p><font size=+2> Alec Russell in Johannesburg writes:</font> The African National Congress and its affiliates have called on South Africans to boycott Shell garages for two days next week to protest at the company's policy in Nigeria.

	<p>The South African- Nigerian Democratic Support Group, a mixture of political, religious and sports organisations said yesterday it had decided on the action to pressure Shell to push the Nigerian government for democratic reform. The ANC deputy-  secretary general Cheryl Carolus, said that the group would consider a protracted campaign if the boycott on Tuesday and Wednesday had no effect.

	<p>For Shell South Africa, this is a throwback to the Eighties, when anti-apartheid activists applied similar tactics to try to force the company to disinvest from the country. 

	<p>Shell produces half of Nigeria's daily Output  1-9 million barrels of oil, and ' critics of the ruling junta believe the Anglo-Dutch company could do more to encourage reform. 

	<p>The South African governmental is split on the call for a boycot. </body></html>

<H2>Shell facing new onslaught over Nigeria

By Paul Adams, Robert
Cosine, William Lewis and
Roger Matthews </H2>


<p>Royal Dutch Shell this weekend comes under renewed attack from pressure groups for its relationship with the Nigerian government. Documents to be released by The Body Shop, the UK cosmetics group which has been leading the campaign against the Anglo-Dutch oil group, are said to show links between the Nigerian government and Shell Nigerian executives.

	<p>Shell's role in Nigeria has been heavily criticised following the Nigerian government's execution of nine minority rights activists from the Ogoni tribe, including writer Mr Ken SaroWiwa. They had accused Shell of causing extensive environmental damage in the ogoni region, one of the main onshore oil producing areas in Nigeria . The Body Shop and other environmentalists and human rights groups have called for consumer boycotts of Shell for not using its position in Nigeria to put pressure on the government.

	<p>One document to be released tomorrow shows a Shell Nigeria manager writing in May 1993 to the governor of Rivers State, which includes Ogoni Land. "We humbly request the usual assistance of His Excellency to enable the project to proceed," wrote Mr J. Udofia in a letter dated May 4 1993. His letter followed heavy disruption to Shell operations in Ogoni Land, from which Shell has since withdrawn.

	<p>Mr Eric Nickson a Shell spokesman, said yesterday. The usual assistance means if there is an incident we are
obliged to notify the authori-  ties that there is a disruption in the supply of oil." He said. "Having done that, and it looked like there was going to be violence and crime, then we normally asked the governor to put the processes in place to stop that."

	<p>Asked if this meant military assistance, Mr Nickson replied: "It is not army."

	Other documents purport to show that Dr Owens wiwa I brother of Mr Saro-Wiwa, attempted to negotiate with Mr Brian Anderson, managing director of Shell's operations in Nigeria. Yesterday Mr Anderson said: "We did not negotiate. We were not in a position to negotiate his (Ken Saro-Wiwa's) release. We had no power to do so."

	<p>Shell and its partners in Nigeria's liquefied natural gas project yesterday announced that they had signed the main construction contract worth an estimated $3bn (1.0bn) with a consortium of Kellogg of the US, Technip of France, Snamprogetti of Italy and the JGC of Japan.

	<p>The LNG gas project is a joint venture between state owned Nigerian National. Petroleum Corporation, Shell Agip of Italy and Elf of France. Meanwhile, a broad South African coalition, headed by  the African National Congress, yesterday called for a two-day local boycott of Shell products in protest at the company's alleged failure to put pressure on the Nigerian regime.

	<P>The South African Nigerian Democracy Support Group,  which includes employers; organisations, unions,, churches and sports groups, said it would picket Shell outlets in South Africa.	</body></html>

Ken Saro-Wiwi<p>

You don't need to be an expert in African politics, economics or history to understand what has happened to Nigerian poet Ken Saro-Wiwa.  <p>
The essential truth is that a man has been hanged for peacefully protesting the destruction of his land and his people by multinational oil interests.<p>

Ken Saro-Wiwa's sentence has been imposed by a military dictatorship acting in collusion with Multinational Oil Companies.  Loved in Nigeria as a poet and playwright, his charismatic, non-violent leadership of the Ogoni has captured headlines around the world.<p>

The Ogoni are one of at least eight minority ethnic groups in the Niger Delta whose land sits over petrolem reserves coveted by Shell Oil.  Pursuit of these reserves has destroyed the Delta's ecosystem polluting land and water in this area which was once known as "the food basket of Nigeria".  Hundreds of Ogoni lives have been lost and villages destroyed.<p>


In May 1994, Nigeria's dictators, led by General Sani Abacha, framed Ken Saro-Wiwa for murder to silence his protests. <p>
They obviously felt death was the only way they could guarantee his silence.<p>

The Ogoni people have lost their spokesman and are now  in more danger than ever.<p>

It's right to feel rage, but don't mourn Ken Saro-Wiwa. <p>
Instead celebrate him in his own words Dance your anger and your joys.<p>

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>Greenpeace welcomes scientists' report on Brent Spar</H4>

         
<P>London--22 May 1996--Greenpeace today welcomed the report by
international scientists brought together by UK Energy Minister
Tim Eggar. The scientists rejected the "case by case" cornerstone
of the UK Government's policy on decommissioning oil and gas
installations, recommending that the Government take into account
the cumulative impacts of all disposals of waste at sea.

<P>The "Scientific Group on Decommissioning" was set up by UK Energy
Minister Mr Tim Eggar in November 1995.  The scientists were
asked to look into the environmental implications of deep sea
disposal of the Brent Spar oil installation, following
Greenpeace's successful campaign to stop Shell dumping it in the
North East Atlantic.

<P>Working under the auspices of the Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC) and chaired by Professor John Shepherd of
Southampton Oceanography Centre, the scientists concluded:-
<P>* The UK Government should not assess each installation purely
on a "case by case" basis. It should also take into account the
cumulative impacts of all disposals of waste at sea.

<UL>
<LI>

The decision making process before licensing the dumping of the
Brent Spar should have included factors such as the need to
conserve energy and resources by reducing, re-using and recycling
waste. Other factors such as public acceptability should also be
taken into account in future.  

<LI>Any problems with disposing of the Brent Spar on shore are no
more difficult than have already been overcome with other
installations.

</UL>

"This report clearly shows that scientific opinion does not back
Government policy," said Dr Helen Wallace of Greenpeace UK.
Energy Minister Mr Tim Eggar "should stop using science as an
excuse to ignore public concern about the environment. He must
announce that all installations will be brought on shore. Doing
so would not only benefit the environment but it could generate
long-term decommissioning contracts and jobs for UK Industry."

<P>Greenpeace said today's report gave a strong backing to the
decision made by the Oslo Paris Commission (1) last year to agree
a moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore
installations.  The UK and Norwegian Governments have expressed
reservations to the moratorium.

<P>"Greenpeace believes that this group of scientists have given a
very strong message that the OSPAR moratorium should be turned
into a ban as soon as possible," said Wallace.

<P>NOTES TO EDITORS 

<P>[1] OSCOM Decision 95/1. This was by the Parties to the Oslo
Convention decided at a meeting in June 1995:  "to agree on a
moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore
installations until the Oslo Commission or a Commission in its
succession has adopted a Decision on the disposal of offshore
installations with a view to banning the disposal of such      
installations at sea."

<P>[2] NERC report on decommissioning: the main findings
 
<P>The  Committee was set up by the Natural Environment  Research
Council  at the request of Mr T Eggar, the Energy Minister  at
the Department of Trade and Industry following the controversy
surrounding  the attempt to dispose of the Brent Spar  in  the
deep Atlantic in the Summer of 1995.
 <UL>



<LI>Both  cumulative and case by case impacts of the disposal 
     of   off-shore  oil  installations  should  be  assessed, 
     because continued disposals with small individual  impact 
     might  give rise, by small increments, to an unacceptably 
     large overall impact.
 
<LI>Some means should be sought to take public acceptability  
   into account in evaluating future  marine environmental     
impact assessments.
 
<LI>Nothing  in this report should be taken as promoting  the 
     deep sea disposal of decommissioned off-shore structures, 
     or of any other wastes.
 
<LI>Any  decision to proceed, or not to proceed, with dumping 
     oil  structures  or  other wastes in the  ocean  involves 
     social,  economic, ethical, and aesthetic  considerations 
     which  are  outside  the competence  of  the  group,  and 
     judgements  in  which  the technical  assessment  of  the 
     environmental  impact  is  only  one  factor,   and   not 
     necessarily the most important one.
 
<LI>From  an  engineering point of view the difficulties  and 
     hazards of onshore disposal are no more than have already 
     been  encountered  and successfully  overcome  for  other 
     installations.
 
<LI>Many  factors  should  influence a  decision  on  whether 
     disposal   of  off-shore  structures  as  waste   is   an 
     appropriate course of action. These should have  included 
     such  general  considerations as  the  need  to  conserve 
     energy and natural resources by reducing, re-using and re- 
     cycling potential waste whenever practicable.
 
<LI>The  disposal  site  chosen for the Brent  Spar  was  not 
     necessarily unsuitable, but it is unlikely that the  site 
     was  the  most suitable which could be found  within  the 
     criteria used.
 
<LI>The deep sea environment can be surprisingly biologically 
     rich,   but   our   level  of  certainty  regarding   the 
     environment, and hence our predictive ability with regard 
     to environmental impacts, is much lower (in the deep sea) 
     than for inshore areas on the continental shelf.
<LI> Natural and man-made analogues provide good parallels  to 
     many  aspects of the disposal of a structure such as  the 
     Brent  Spar but the local impact of shipwrecks has hardly 
     yet been studied, and considerably more work must be done 
     if the local impact is to be assessed in detail.
 
<LI>If deep sea disposal were to be considered, further study 
     in  depth  of the risks, hazards, engineering procedures, 
     and financial assessments will need to be made before  an 
     unequivocal conclusion for deep sea disposal  as  against 
     other viable disposal means, can be reached.
 
<LI>Much  of  the relevant documentation concerning the  deep 
     sea  disposal  of  the Brent Spar was confidential  until 
     very  recently.   This prevented assessment  by  a  wider 
     community of the case being made.

<TITLE>SHELL SYSTEMATICALLY POLLUTED AQUIFER IN TURKEY

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>SHELL SYSTEMATICALLY POLLUTED AQUIFER IN TURKEY, LEAKED MEMOS REVEAL</H4>
 
<P>Istanbul, March 26, 1996 (GP) - The multinational oil company Shell has, over
a 25 year period, systematically polluted a huge underground reserve of
potential drinking water in an aquifer near the city of Diyarbakir in Southeast
Turkey where up to two million people live, Greenpeace revealed at a press
conference in Istanbul.

<P>Internal Shell documents leaked to Greenpeace and released today show that Shell
has pumped 487.5 million barrels of production water contaminated with crude
oil, solvents and other chemicals into the Midyat aquifer between 1973 and 1994.
(1)  
 
<P>The documents reveal that Shell knew it was polluting the aquifer, and allocated
money to reduce the problem.  However, Shell later stopped the work, clawed back
the money and sold the operation to the international operating company,
Perenco. 

<P>One of the internal memos leaked to Greenpeace, dated December 22 1995 states:
"It is unfortunate to see a change of priorities towards maximising cash before
divestment by sacrificing environmental targets" (2).

<P>Many of the Shell documents confirm that Shell managers knew that the injection
into the aquifer was against both European Union and Turkish environmental
regulations. (3)  Indeed the Turkish Government tried to order Shell to stop the
pollution. 

<P>Paul Horsman, Greenpeace International's Oil Campaigner, said in Istanbul: "The
double standards and the non-existent ethics of Shell are now clear to
everybody. Shell and Perenco are just keen to make money at the expense of the
environment and the people of Turkey. Shell would have never injected polluted
water into aquifers in Britain or The Netherlands."  
 
<P>After receiving all Shell documents, Greenpeace met with Shell representatives
in Istanbul last January. Greenpeace asked them questions relating to the
pollution of the aquifer. The Shell representatives denied that the oil content
in the water was high as revealed by their documents.

<P>The Shell documents reveal that an additional 172.3 million barrels of polluted
water will be injected into the aquifer by the end of 2001 (4).  In the "worst
case" the aquifer could be polluted up to 14-20 km away from the well by the
year 2006 and that by 2030-2060 it will be under the City of Diyarbakir with
aquifer contamination for 100-300 years.  The reported "likely" case is
pollution apparent at 2.5-5 km from a well and contamination at Diyarbakir after
840-1000 years. (5).

<h4>SHELL IN TURKEY - SUMMARY</h4>

<H5>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL, MARCH 1996 </H5>
 
<P>Greenpeace is in possession of a number of confidential internal
reports and memos, (see Annexes) written over a number of years
by employees of N. V. Turkse Shell oil company (Shell's company
operating in Turkey).  These demonstrate some of the
environmental and safety standards which Shell operate in that
country.  A specific case of systematic pollution is illustrated
as the documents reveal how Shell has been injecting huge amounts
of contaminated water into an aquifer in the Diyarbakir area in
eastern Turkey for over 20 years.  This is the Midyat aquifer
which is a potable water supply.
 
<P>The documents not only reveal that this practice has been
ongoing, but that Shell were aware that it is against European
regulations.  Furthermore, the documents show that it is mainly
relatively small cost savings which prevented Shell from stopping
the practice.  In some of the documents it is acknowledged that
there is a potential threat to the water supply of the city of
Diyabkir over future generations.  The solution to the problem
is to inject the produced water back into the Mardin Oil
reservoir, from which the water originally came and funding was
allocated to change the injection from the aquifer to the oil
reservoir, however, funding for this project was cancelled.  

<P><H5>THE POLLUTION OF MIDYAT AQUIFER</H5>
 
<P>Internal memos from 1986 and 1987 signed by the then General
Manager, C. E. Fay identify the problem and call for increasing
efforts to resolve it.  Subsequently, in 1991, the General
Directorate of Petroleum Affairs (GDPA) in Turkey wrote to Shell
and demanded that "In order to stop contamination in the Midyat
aquifer you are emphatically requested to ensure that henceforth
the necessary measures are urgently taken to have the disposal
waters injected into the Mardin Formation through the wells that
have ceased production, making sure that disposal waters are not
injected into the Midyat Formation, and to inform GDPA about the
matter."
 
<P>Above the Midyat aquifer is a geological gravel formation called
Selmo, through which the wells have to be drilled in order to
reach the aquifer.  (A diagramatic cross-section of the area is
in one of the reports.)  Other memos note that drilling muds have
been lost into this formation and that, because of corrosion of
the pipelines, it is possible that produced water has also
contaminated the Selmo.  This threatens the local rivers and
lakes; in particular a local reservoir called Devegecidi.  
The alternative to disposal into the Midyat aquifer, as noted in
the letter from the authorities, is to re-inject the produced
water into the Mardin oil field.  It is noted that only "a Mardin
disposal scheme ... will give a fully acceptable disposal method
satisfying International legislation".  Hence a Mardin injection
pilot test was being considered in 1989.  
 
<P>However injecting into the aquifer was ongoing in 1994, as a
letter from Turkse Shell to Shell International demonstrates. 
This letter also states that if "as a result of water disposal
into Midyat, the water supply of Diyarbakir is affected then the
water produced for domestic use from wells spread over a large
area is required to be treated or an alternative water supply has
to be found. In both cases the cost is expected to be high."   

<P>This letter shows that between 1973 and 1994, 487.5 million
barrels of production water has been injected into the Midyat
aquifer.  According to earlier memos the amount of oil lost into
the aquifer is between 15 and 35 barrels per day.  In 1994 it is
reported that the current situation is that 82.8% of the daily
produced water is injected into the Midyat aquifer.  In a worst
case scenario, by the year 2006 the polluted water will be 14-20
km away from the injected well and contaminate the aquifer under
the city of Diyarbakir for the next 100-300 years.  The "likely
case" is reported to be contamination after 800-1000 years.  

<P>A further report indicates that, not only has produced water been
injected into the aquifer, but the recommended method for dealing
with radioactive LSA scale (a scale which builds up inside
pipelines and wells) is to grind it up and inject it with the
disposal water.  In fact a valve replacement on one of the lines
showed a high build up of scale and the "radiological testing
indicated this scale to be highly radioactive".  While LSA scale
is described as 'naturally occurring', this is in the oil
reservoir and not in the aquifer.
 
<P>Solving the problem, ie injecting produced water into the Mardin
oil reservoir, is costed at between US$ 2.2 million, (five
converted wells over 1994-95) and US$ 15 million (7 converted
wells by the end of 1995 with a futher 8 planned by the end of
1997).  Shell settle for the cheaper option and in the minutes
of a meeting held in October 1994 the objective is stated as to
achieve "50% injection into the Mardin" oil reservoir by the end
of 1995.
 
<P>However, during 1995 Shell sold the operation to Perenco.  This
sale is completed by the end of the year, but a memo from a
meeting with Perenco representatives in Decmber 1995 states that
"the planned increase in the Mardin injection could not be
achieved ... due to cancellation of funds (US 1.2 million)
originally budgeted for the Mardin water injection projects. Thus
the end of 1995 target of 45% Mardin injection was not achieved
and remained at ca 25%. It is unfortunate to see a change of
priorities towards maximising cash before divestment by
sacrificing environmental targets."
 
<H5>SHELL'S GENERAL STANDARDS OF OPERATIONS IN TURKEY</H5>
 
<P>Two documents reveal the general standards of Shell's operations
in Turkey.  The first document, written in 1991, is a Technical
Safety Audit and highlights a number of environment and safety
issues.  It identifies the fact that since "the management
controls to ensure safety at the work site are not effective the
overall rating is unsatisfactory".  The report also states that
the "present standard of operation may be understandable, ... but
it is unacceptable in a Shell company. Operations which cannot
achieve the required minimum standard should be closed down or
disposed of."  Futhermore it is noted that if is not possible for
the company to "establish control of its operation" then it
"should reconsider whether it wishes to continue as the
operator".  
 
<P>Other issues raised in this report are:
 
   <P>  - a rapid increase in claims for pollution damage; 
 <br>    - a recommendation made in "a 1986 review of field
     measurement ... to provide test lines for the 60% of the  
     wells which cannot be tested except by using the Mobile   
     Test Unit (MTU), has been repeatedly postponed"; 
   <br>   - a commitment to safety and the environment is
     "subordinate to production" in the "middle of the
     organisation"; 
   <br>   - the atmospheric and health problems from a programme of 
     mixing crude with diesel fuel; 
   <br>   - an action to stop "disposal of production water into the 
     potable aquifer as soon as possible as recommended by 1989 
     environmental audit."
 
<P>The second document, written in June 1994 entitled: "Exploration
and Programme Support 1995", discusses some of the problems
highlighted in the technical audit of 1991. It notes that oil
spills reported in 1993 were 218, down from 290 in 1992, which
represents a total of 1,171 tonnes of oil spilt.  It states that
there are plans to reduce the total land payments (compensation
for aquisition and damage) from over US$ 1 million in 1993 to US$
0.5 million by 1997.  However, despite the concerns about
atmospheric pollution arising from the mix of crude and diesel
fuels, further moves to use this mix are planned.
 
<P>Furthermore, under the section discussing environment it is
stated that the Turkish authorities are demonstrating a growing
interest in environmental issues with the possibility of
"relatively stringent legislation being enacted, and a new draft
law introduced which will replace the existing law when
officially published".  This increased interest provides shell
with the following concerns: 
   <P>  - produced water injection, 
    <br> - land farming, 
    <br> - Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) studies, 
     <br>- oil spillages, 
    <br> - waste management, abandonment and clean up of oil
       contamination."
 
<P>In fact there are standards in Europe for most of these issues
and have been for years.  In other European countries, Shell
would have to operate at these standards.  However, a year after
the production of this report, Shell sold off the operations to
the international operating company, Perenco.
 
<H5>WHO IS PERENCO?</H5>
 
<P>Perenco plc is an international oil and gas operating company
formed by merging the two companies, Kelt Energy plc and Perenco
It is based in London and Paris with exploration and production
interests in the US, Britain, Colombia, Gabon and Cameroun.  
The main business strategy, has been to buy unprofitable
producing assets from majors and operate them at a profit after
paring staff and operating costs to a minimum.  They boast that
they operate with 50 per cent of the staff of a major and without
a substantial number of expatriates and "are not afraid to make
itself unpopular with other oil companies, contractors, or
government departments".

<head><title>	GREENPEACE SUCCESSES, 1995
</title></head>



<body bgcolor="#ffffef"TEXT="#000000" LINK="#000090"  ALINK="#FF0000" VLINK="#400060><p><H1>	GREENPEACE SUCCESSES, 1995</H1>

<p>This year has seen environmental and peace issues take centre 
stage on the world's agenda.  Greenpeace's work has 
contributed to a number of important international successes 
including:

<p><font size=+1>NUCLEAR</font>

<p> France, the US, the UK, Russia and China commit to signing a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to pursue other 
nuclear disarmament measures as the price for extending the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May.

<p>France, the US, the UK and recently Russia commit to a zero-
yield CTBT in July and August which is expected to be signed 
in 1996.

<p><font size=+1>OIL</font><a name=oil>

<p>The OSPAR Commission, 14 member states regulating marine 
pollution in the North East Atlantic, bans the dumping of 
obsolete offshore installations in June despite reservations 
from the UK and Norway.

<p>Shell agreed not to dispose of its obsolete oil platform, 
the <a href="../brent/brent.html">Brent Spar</a>

<p><font size=+1>LAND-BASED SOURCES OF MARINE POLLUTION (LBS)</font>

<p>The North Sea Ministerial Conference agrees that the 
discharge, emission and losses of hazardous substances in the 
North Sea must cease within one generation--25 years--in June.

<p> Over 100 countries meeting in Washington, DC under the 
auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) 
agree to adopt a legally binding instrument to ban the 
discharge, emission, manufacture, use and illegal trade of 
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) that may harm the 
environment and human health.  This treaty could be completed 
and up for ratification by the end of 1997.

<p><font size=+1>WASTE TRADE</font>

<p> After years of campaigning by Greenpeace to stop hazardous 
waste exports from industrialized to developing countries, the 
contracting parties to the Basel Convention decided in 
September to ban this practice.

<p>The Bamako Convention, an African waste trade treaty banning 
the import of hazardous waste to the continent, enters into 
force.  A similar treaty for the Pacific, the Waigani Treaty, 
is adopted.

<p><font size=+1>TOXIC CHEMICALS</font>

<p>The German-based company Hoechst voluntarily agrees to phase 
out toxic chloroparaffins in Germany in Brazil.

<p><font size=+1>CLIMATE</font>

<p>At a meeting in Berlin in April, more than 150 countries 
agree to negotiate a legally binding green house gas emissions 
reduction target for the period after 2000.

<p><font size=+1>OZONE</font>

<p> After a four day Greenpeace blockade at a Greek CFC plant, 
the Greek Ministry of the Environment announces that the 
company must reduce its production by 50% in 1995, eliminate 
all CFC production in 1996 and that Greece will phase out 
ozone-depleting HCFCs no later than the most progressive 
European countries.

<p><font size=+1>WHALING</font>

<p> The so-called science behind the Norwegian whaling programme 
was exposed as a sham at this year's International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) meeting when the country's whaling scientists 
made grave mistakes in their whale population estimates 
forcing Norway's whaling quota to be reduced and the IWC to 
ask the country to recall its whalers.
 
<p><font size=+1>OVER-FISHING</font>

<p>In August, the United Nations agreed to a precedent-setting 
global Fisheries Treaty.  The legally binding treaty will set 
new standards for fisheries conservation and, while more 
reforms are needed to solve the global fisheries crisis, is a 
significant step forward.

<p>Canada and the European Union reached a deal limiting the 
catch of falling Turbot wars in March/April off the 
Newfoundland coast after a violent clash between the Canadian 
navy and fishing vessel.  The North Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization (NAFO) deal was an improvement on the fishing 
free-for-all that ignited the fish war and could have meant 
disaster for the turbot stock as it did for cod stocks before 
it.

<p> Despite intense lobbying efforts to prevent it, the US law 
governing fisheries management, the Magnuson Act, was 
reauthorized while plans to establish a fishing quota system 
that would have helped corporations gain control of US fishery 
licenses was abandoned ensuring improved national fishery 
conservation. 


<p><font size=+1>FORESTS</font>

<p>The government of British Columbia agrees to implement 
significant changes to clearcut logging in the region in July 
after a science panel study confirms Greenpeace charges that 
such logging is destroying regional biodiversity.

<p> Following pressure from Greenpeace, the New York Times 
agrees in November to cancel all contracts with logging 
company MacMillian Bloedel, the largest logging company 
operating in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, because 
company continues to clearcut log in defiance of the science 
panel study mentioned above. 

<p>In August, two regions, Vienna City forests and Germany's 
Luebeck Public Forest agree to log only in compliance with 
Greenpeace's sustainable forestry principals and guidelines.

<p><font size=+1>BIODIVERSITY</font>


<p>The highest body of the European Patent Office (EPO), the
Enlarged Board of Appeal, decided in December that genetically 
engineered plants, seeds and their progeny cannot be patented 
under the European Patent Convention (EPC).  This act is 
expected to help to prevent the large-scale commercialization 
of genetically engineered life forms, prevent industry from 
claiming ownership over nature and protect natural 
biodiversity.

<P><H4>NEW OPINION POLL BACKS GREENPEACE STANCE ON OIL PLATFORM DUMPING.</H4>
 

 


<p>London--5 February 1996--Almost three quarters (74%) of the British public who
are aware of the Brent Spar controversy believe Greenpeace should continue its
campaign against the dumping of oil platforms, according to an Opinion Leader
Research  poll carried out for Greenpeace in the UK. Furthermore, 57%  believe
the Brent Spar should not have been dumped in the Atlantic (32% in favour). (1).
 
<p>57% also backed Greenpeace rather than Shell and the UK Government in stopping
the sinking of the Brent Spar.  A clear majority of the public (57%) had heard
of the controversy surrounding the Brent Spar; 41% had not. Only 17% believe
that Greenpeace should not continue to oppose further sinking of other oil
platforms at sea. 
 
<p>The 1,000 person national telephone poll was carried out between 26th and 27th 
January 1996.
 
<p>Chris Rose, Campaign Director of Greenpeace UK said "This polls shows that the
public knows its wrong to use the seas as an industrial dumping ground.  The 
public will never accept it if the Government allows the oil industry to treat
the seas as its rubbish dump. The sea should be for saving - not for dumping."
 
<p>A report commissioned by the oil industry itself (the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators' Association -- UKOOA) stated that the best environmental option for
decommissioned oil installations was to bring them on shore for recycling (2).
 
<p>Chris Rose said "The Government must listen to the public and expert advice to
the oil industry itself. Mr Eggar [UK Minister of Energy] must pledge no North
Sea installations should be dumped at sea."
 
<p>A report commissioned by Greenpeace - entitled "A Case Study of Onshore
Decommissioning Of North Sea Oil Strutures" - stated that over 95% of the Brent
Spar could be recycled, using existing technology.(3)

<TITLE>GREENPEACE APPLAUDS NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION ON ESSO RIG</H4>
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<a href="brent.html"><img align=right src="vict02t.gif" border=0></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>GREENPEACE APPLAUDS NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT DECISION ON ESSO RIG</h4>

Oslo--8 March 1996--Greenpeace today applauded the Norwegian Government's decision to reject oil company Esso's proposal to dump the 7000 tonne steel jacket of its Odin rig into the North Sea, and called on the Government to legislate against this type of sea dumping altogether. <P>

The proposal by Esso to dump the jacket of the Odin rig into the North Sea off Bergen was against the company's own environmental advice, which claimed that the steel could be recycled on land, creating 200 jobs for Norwegians, plus a substantial economic gain. <P>

"The Norwegian Government is acting very sensibly in favour of sustainable environmental practice," said Greenpeace Norway's Katrin Glatz Brubakk. "We now need to see the Government pass legislation ensuring that all oil and gas installations are decommissioned on land,"  said Brubakk. <P>

"There is also no reason why Norway and the UK Governments cannot join the vast majority of nations that have already signed onto the Oslo Paris Commission's ban on the dumping of all offshore installations at sea [1]," she said.   <P>

Had the dumping gone ahead, it would have set a precedent for the dumping of up to 416 installations in the North Sea's Norwegian and UK offshore oil sectors, said Brubakk. She noted that the onshore disposal of the Odin rig was the third such decision since Shell reversed its plan to dump its Brent Spar last year.  Elf's North East Frigg in Norway and the installations in the Emerald field off Scotland will both be brought ashore.  <P>

The environmental and economic gains of investing in such a policy would be far more beneficial than the current "case by case" policy adopted by both countries. <P>

Esso also proposed to leave a further 6000 tonnes of steel pipeline in situ on the sea floor.   The Norwegian Department of Trade and Industry has not yet decided on the future of the pipeline, giving a four year delay to that decision.  Greenpeace said that there was no reason why the pipeline should not be dismantled on land also when the Frigg field is decommissioned.<P>

The dumping of the Odin's steel structure would have been the equivalent of the Norwegian Government allowing Esso to dump 7,000 cars into the ocean, she said. <P>

Greenpeace International's Executive Director Thilo Bode yesterday sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, calling on her to recognise the environmental unsustainability of such a move.  Greenpeace Norway also placed an advertisement in Norwegian papers today urging the Government to reject Esso's application. <P>

Esso had proposed to turn the rig's structure into an "artificial reef", but this idea had been vigorously opposed by the Norwegian fishermen.  "This was an attempt by Esso to look green while turning the North Sea into a scrapyard," said Brubakk. <P>

or Cindy Baxter Greenpeace Communications ++44 171 833 0600<P>

[1] The Oslo Paris Commission last June adopted a ban on the dumping of offshore oil and gas installations in the North East Atlantic, "....due to the fact that the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore installations cannot be considered to be a sustainable practice which takes into account the precautionary approach..."<P>

Norway and the UK have both lodged objections to this ban, arguing that the installations should be looked at on a case by case basis. <P>

<P><H4>Background document on Odin</h4>


Esso has proposed that the jacket is toppled in situ and used as an artificial reef. The depth of the site is 103 meters, and is 178 kilometres off the coast - west of Bergen. No bottom dwelling fish, only pelagic (mainly cod). The  sea bed is only mud and sand. <P>
 <P>
The Odin platform is a gas installation with a steel jacket. It is fairly small  - 40 x 40 x 112 meters (jacket). On top the drilling equipment, living quarters. Esso propose to take the top ashore for reuse and recycling. The legs of  the jacket is proposed cut at 5 meters ( either with explosives or by mechanical cutting) and then tipped on its side. That leaves 63 meters of water above the  jacket. They do not want to clean the jacket before toppled, and will leave  paint and anodes on the construction and drilling mud beneath it (not very  much) They also want to leave all the pipelines. <P>
 <P>
A scientific institute in Stavanger, Norway says that it will be very  interesting to study the jacket as a reef, and they believe that it might  have a positive effect. They argue that it will protect fish from fishermen, and therefor be of benefit to the marine environment. This group will get 2,8 million dollars for research if Esso are allowed to topple in situ...   <P>

The political attitude towards this is in general very negative. Nobody really  believes that an artificial reef will have an effect in the North Sea - at that  depth, in an area where there are no natural reefs  and very far away from the coastline. <P>
 <P>
Politicians say that if Esso are allowed to dump, they will probably have to remove it and dump it in a deep fjord, not topple it in situ.   <P>
Esso proposes that they have responsibility of  the jacket, if toppled in situ,  for five years, while the research is going on. After that Norway has to take responsibility. This is a proposal the Government is not too happy about this proposal, so it is likely that they will ask Esso to take full responsibility or <P>
as them to dump on a deeper site instead or ... ask them to take it ashore.   <P>

Decision about what will happen to Odin, is taken by the Government today.  They will need a final approval from the Parliament, but due to the political  situation, it is very rear that a proposal from the Government is changed.   <P>



THE ODIN FIELD<P>
 <P>
The Odin field is placed 178 kilometres west off Bergen, and  has one   fully integrated steel installation, with living  quarters and drilling    equipment. The gas is transported  to the Frigg field for processing, and   from there to St. Fergus in Scotland. The field is 100% owned and   operated by Esso Norway. Total investments in the field since the   beginning of the production has been 4.4 million  UK pounds.   <P>
The field was closed down in August 1994, due to lack of further   gas reserves at the field. It had then been  pumping gas for ten years, at a   total amount of 27,7 billion  Sm3. The field was found in 1970, but   production did not start till October 1984. The platform was installed July   1983.  The weld is closed down, the pipeline is blocked in each end,   cleaned and filled with sea water. Nobody is living on the  platform, but   people from Esso is going out to the platform  once a month to look after   it. <P>
 <P>
Esso has made a environmental/economic study for the different   alternatives of what can be done with Odin. They are especially   emphasising that  toppling of the jacket  can have a positive impact as an   artificial reef at the field.  The platform consists of the separate parts, that  
can be handled in different ways. <P>

 
<pre>           Topside              Jacket          Pipeline   
        1. Recycle              Recycle         Recycle 
        2. Recycle              Recycle         Leave 
        3. Recycle              Dump            Leave 
->->->  4. Recycle              Toppling        Leave 
        5. Dump                 Toppling        Leave 
        6. Toppling             Toppling        Leave 
        7. Dump                 Dump            Leave 
 
* Recycle or reused 
->->-> The option Esso asks for allowance to do - ie. topple jacket in situ   
</pre>
It is however clear that Esso will take the topside ashore regardless of   what the Parliament decides. This because they hope that it will be   possible to reuse this part of the  platform. If that is not possible, they will  <P>
recycle it. All  loose equipment will also be removed, in a hope to reuse   it.  <P>
 <P>
Esso has looked into the environmental benefits of recycling in stead of   producing new steel and other  metals, but also how polluting transport of   the different  parts would be. By recycling in stead of producing new metals,  you save between 85 and 95% of use of energy and water and pollution to air,  land and water. <P>
 <P>
They also look into how much they could earn by selling the metals for recycling. <P>
Total  costs for the different alternatives will however look like this:   <P>
Alt. 1. 37,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 2. 26,6 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 3. 27,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 4. 19,7 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 5. 20,0 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 6. 21,3 million pounds <BR>
Alt. 7. 28,0 million pounds <BR>
<BR>
 
 
So bringing everything ashore will cost about 13 million pound more than  toppling. 7 million to bring the jacket ashore, but to leave the pipeline.  (NB - Numbers have changed since they gave this figure to the  government - estimated costs of removing the jacket now - 3 to 4 million  pound, i.e. half the cost!) <P>
 <P>
Esso will only have to pay part of the costs of decommissioning the   platform.  Norway will pay a certain percentage of the total costs. How   high the percentage will be, depends on how much tax Esso has paid to   Norway during their operational period. This is somewhere between 60   and 70 %. In addition to that Esso can ask for economical help from the   Parliament. There is no fixed rule for how much this can be, but in the   case of Nord Oest Frigg, Norway paid 60 % of the costs (including the   percentage of the tax)  <P>
 <P>
Employment effects of the alternatives <P>

 
Alt.1. 640 people employed for one year <BR>
Alt.2. 560 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.3. 560 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.4. 450 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.5. 430 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.6. 470 --------------"--------------- <BR>
Alt.7. 520 --------------"--------------- <BR>

 <P>
So 190 more jobs by taking everything ashore instead of toppling, like  Esso would like to do. <P>
 <P>
The report states that the best environmental option would be to recycle   all parts of the installation, but that alternative 3 and 4 is fully   environmental acceptable, since the jacket consists of only small amounts   of  toxic chemicals, and that the area in general is not very polluted.  Esso   also states that the fishing ground in the area is not  very commonly used,   and not used at all by Norwegian fishermen. Scottish fishermen are the only   once using the area.  <P>
 <P>
Esso's suggestion of what to do with Odin, is alternative four.(the   cheapest alternative) That includes that the topside is taken a shore for   reuse or recycling, the jacked is toppled in situ and the pipeline is left   where it is. Esso claims that this is the best alternative, since they remove    and recycle the most polluting parts, and that the jacket will be perfect as   an artificial reef. Esso has also offered a scientific institute in Bergen/ Stavanger  1,7 million  pounds to research on the effects of such a reef.    <P>
Esso has send this suggestion to the Department of Energy and Industry.   The suggestion has then been commented on by different parties. After  looking into all different suggestions, the Department send their suggestion to the Parliament who makes the final decision.  The decision in parliament  will probably be taken mid April/beginning of May. <P>
 <P>
When the decision is taken, Esso will give the assignment for   removal/toppling/dumping to a company who can deal with all parts of   the operation (this company might contact sub-operators, but Esso   doesn't care about that. The want the task done) Esso have however   asked for an offer from different companies for the removal operations for   all the options to make sure they are prepared  when the Parliament    decides what shall be done. Esso does not want to say how fast they will   start the operational process after the decision from Parliament, but it is   likely that they will start more or less immediately. <P>

 <P>
The total weight of the platform, including the pipeline,  is 29.011 tons.   The pipeline alone weights 15.082 tons, and is 26400 meters long (dia   20") <P>
 <P>
The Jacket consists of 7000 tons of structural steel, 30 tons of PVC, 133   tons of steel pipes and approx. 207 tons present in anodes(aluminium   anodes). The anodes consist of approx. 3% zinc, in total an amount of 6,2   tons.  The weight of metals like copper, chrome and nickel in the steel is 40   tons. <P>
 <P>
The pipelines consists 6000 tons of structural steel, and  have a   protection shell of asbestos ( 29 tons) and tear (16,6 tons). In addition   the pipeline has a shell of concrete(9000 tons) to heighten the weight. 567   aluminium anodes are still attached to the pipeline, and are estimated to   weight 53,5 tons (originally 100 tons)<P>

	<P><H4><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">1	SYNOPSIS</A></H4>

<P>	1.1.	The Brent Spar was installed in the North Sea Brent Field in 1976, to provide a storage and tanker off-loading system for the Brent platforms: The buoy is approximately 140 m in
height, cylindrical in shape and moored to the sea bed by six anchors. it is made up of large
oil storage tanks at the base, buoyancy tanks towards the middle and topsides containing
the offshore tanker loading equipment.

<P>	1.2.	The Spar reached the end of its useful working life in the late 80's and was taken out of commission in 1991, in preparation for abandonment. Various onshore and offshore
abandonment options have been examined by the operators, Shell (UK) Exploration and
Production. The preferred option is to tow the structure to an approved deep water disposal
site in the NE Atlantic and sink it. A summary of the selection process can be found in the
Best Practicable Environmental Option Assessment Report for the Brent Spar abandonment.

<P>      1.3.	This report describes the predicted fate of the Spar based on the characteristics and contents of the buoy, and current knowledge of the deep sea environment. The term used to describe
this type of prediction in the '1991 Oslo Commission Guidelines for the Disposal of Offshore
Installations at Sea' is an 'Impact Hypothesis'.

<P>	1.4.	The environmental impacts of three sinking scenarios have been considered. The most likely scenario is that the buoy will sink to the sea bed and remain intact after impact. This means that the residual contaminants contained within the structure will slowly leak into the
bottom waters arid sediments ('slow release' scenario). The alternative of major damage to
the storage tanks (and fast release of residual contaminants contained within the structure 
'fast release' scenario) on impact is considered less likely to occur. The third alternative of
tank damage (and release of some of the residual contaminants in the near surface
environment - 'surface release' scenario) is considered unlikely to occur. In all cases,
corrosion of the structure will slowly release metals into the water column.

<P>	1.5.	The potential environmental impacts of each sinking scenario are discussed and the Impact Hypothesis for the most likely scenario (i.e. 'slow release') is developed. For all three
scenarios the hull of the buoy will remain intact for several thousand years due to the slow
rates of corrosion. Eventually the structure will break up and become buried in the sediment
system. The potential environmental impacts from the physical presence of the structure will
be highly localised.

<P>	1.6.	In the 'slow release' scenario, elevated levels of hydrocarbon and heavy metal would be concentrated in the sediment close to the structure, although hydrocarbon may be detectable
up to c.500 m and biological effects up to 150 - 250 m from the structure. The effects of the
'rapid release' scenario, would follow a similar pattern although the area affected would be
expected to be larger (hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.l000 m and biological effects
up to 500 m from the structure) but the effects would be over a much shorter duration. Given
the small numbers of organisms present in the deep ocean and low encounter rates with the
affected area, effects will be insignificant. In the third and least likely scenario (i.e. 'surface
release'), the overall effects on the benthos would be similar to those in the two scenarios.
The additional impacts of the surface release on pelagic organisms in the 'sinking zone'
would be insignificant.

<P>	1.7.	Conservative modelling of the long-term fate of the low specific activity scale. indicates that the estimated dose rates to individuals (human) would be several orders of magnitude
less than those regarded by the IAEA as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control.
Similarly, dose rates to human populations would be well within those acceptable to IAEA.
The dose rates to deep sea organisms would be within the ranges encountered in nature and
effects on natural populations would not be expected.

<P><H4><A NAME="STRUCTURE">2. STRUCTURE OF DOCUMENT<A></H4>

<P>	2.1.	The selection of deep sea disposal as the preferred abandonment option for the Brent Spar as been described in the Best Practicable Environmental Option Assessment Report. The
present document develops and describes the Impact Hypothesis for the disposal of the buoy
at an authorised site in the North East Atlantic.

<P>	2.2.	The Brent Spar, and a summary of the inventory of materials associated with the structure, is described in Section 3. A synopsis of the proposed abandonment operation is provided in
Section 4 and the main features of the potential disposal sites in the NE Atlantic outlined in
Section 5.

<P>	2.3.	The fate of the structure from the time it is sunk to the time it eventually breaks up and becomes incorporated into the sediment system is discussed in Section 6. Three possible
scenarios for the fate of the structure during the initial sinking are considered.

<P>	2.4.	The fate and effects of the residual hydrocarbon and heavy metal contaminants contained within the structure are described in Section 7 and the long-term fate and effects of the
small amounts of Low Specific Activity Scale (LSA) considered in Section 8. More details on the mathematical models used in the long term predictions of LSA scale are included in an Annex.

<P>	2.5.	The conclusions are presented in the form of a short Impact Hypothesis in Section 9.




<P><H4><A NAME="SUMMARY">3. SUMMARY INFORMATION ON THE BRENT SPAR</A></H4>

<P>3.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY

<P>	3.1.1.	The Brent Field is located in Block	211/29 of
the UK Sector of the North Sea, some 190 km
ENE of Shetland. The Spar is located at
Latitude 61deg03' 14.7" N, Longitude 01degt40'04" E,
approximately 2.9 km from the Brent 'A'
platform and 1.9 km from Brent 'B' platform the
water depth in the field is some 140m.

[Figure omitted]

<P>3.1.2. The Brent Spar is a 29m diameter cylindrical buoy which floats vertically in the water with a draft of 109m and a height above water of 28m. It is moored to the sea bed by six anchors. It was constructed using techniques similar to those of ship building and the main structure consists of a thin outer skin of 20 mm plate steel, stiffened by ribs and bulkheads.

<P>3.1.3. The upper section consists of a helideck, crane, tanker mooring and loading boom, and accommodation for 30 people. In the middle of the structure are twelve buoyancy tanks. Below this, the main storage area is divided into six tanks which extend to the base of the buoy, and have a total capacity for c. 300,000 barrels of oil. At the base of the buoy, there is a sealed compartment containing the permanent ballast.

<P>3.1.4. The facility was used to store oil produced at the Brent 'A' platform and to act as a tanker loading facility for the Brent Oil Field. Installed in 1976, it was the sole route for the export of crude oil until the Brent System Pipeline was commissioned in 1978. Since 1978, the Spar has continued to be used as an alternative export route.

<P>3.1.5. The costs of maintaining the Spar increased substantially in the period 1987 to 1990. In 1991, a review concluded that the work necessary to refurbish the facility. and extend its operational life. would cost up to 90 million. The buoy would have to be taken out of commission for a 2 - 3 year period during the refurbishment. Given the age of the structure, the presence of a pipeline system for the export of crude oil and the substantial cost; of refurbishment, it was decided that the Brent Spar should cease operations. It was taken out of commission in September 1991 after l5 years service, in preparation for abandonment.

<P>3.2. INVENTORY OF MATERIALS 

<P>3.2.1. The total weight of the structure is 14,500t, made up of 6,700t of structural steel. 6,800t of permanent ballast and 1000t of equipment. The permanent ballast is solid and made up of haematite, embedded in concrete. Like steel, this material is considered to be inert.

<P>3.2.2. Of particular relevance to the eventual disposal of the structure are the materials (e.g. heavy metals. oils etc.) which might pose a threat to the environment. Inventory items have been classified in accordance with the "Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic 1992" (Oslo and Paris Commissions - OSPARREV). This Convention regulates substances and materials whose disposal at sea is controlled and are referred to as "regulated substances". Surveys carried out in 1991 identified a number of these substances aboard the Spar (AURIS, 1994; Metocean, 1993). These are dominated by three generic classes of 'regulated substances', notably the petrogenic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and low specific activity scale, although there are small quantities of other classes on the structure.


<P>3.2.3. Equipment throughout the structure contains small quantities of heavy metals (in metallic form) as an integral part of the materials of construction. The sacrificial anodes contain an estimated 28.7t of aluminium, 10.2t of zinc metal and minor quantities of cadmium (8 kg), lead (0.6kg), and mercury (0.lkg). Electric cables contain some 13.5t of copper and paint on the structure includes some 3.5t of zinc. Small quantities of lead (2.5kg) and of nickel (3.5kg) are contained in remaining batteries.

<P>3.2.4. Small quantities of other materials are also contained in some of the equipment. Although PCB-containing transformer fluids were replaced some years ago, traces of PCB (<20ml) may still remain in the two transformers. Synthetic materials and plastics are also located on the structure (e.g. in fittings in the accommodation/control room and cable insulation) but the exact quantities are not known (AURIS, 1994; Metocean, 1993).

<P>3.2.5.	The oil storage tanks contain some 48,000m3 of sea water together with an estimated 100t of oily sludge at the bottom. A 1991 analysis indicated that the oily sludge contains an
estimated 9.2t of oil and a number of heavy metals, including cadmium (5.8kg), chromium
(2.1 kg), copper (42.9kg), nickel (3.9kg), lead (8.9kg), zinc (87.4kg), arsenic (0.3kg), and
mercury (0.2kg). The remainder of the sludge is composed of a mixture of sand and scale.
The walls of the storage tanks are also coated with an estimated 41.3t of hydrocarbons, in the
form of thin layer of oil and wax.

<P>4.2.6 The sea water in the storage tanks has not been analysed in detail and it has been conservatively assumed that it will contain hydrocarbons (up to 40ppm) from the residual oil in the tanks together with zinc (up to 12ppm) and aluminium (up to 19ppm) from the internal anodes (AURIS, 1994). In 1991, the storage tanks were treated with 4,500 litres of glyoxal to remove hydrogen sulphide which had accumulated within them. Glyoxal reacts with hydrogen sulphide to form various thiols. It is believed that all the glyoxal reacted in this way and that all the reaction products were removed from the tank during the 1991 decommissioning operation (AURIS, 1994).

<P>3.2.8. Scale is commonly found in oil processing facilities throughout the world. In many areas scale may be contaminated by deposition of small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive salts from the oil reservoirs formation to form low specific activity (LSA) scale. The sludge and scale in the Brent Spar contain a number of naturally occurring radio nuclides, some of which have very short radioactive half-lives (seconds, minutes or hours) and others which are longer-lived (half-lives of years). These radio nuclides are all members of "chains", that is they are formed by the decay of radioactive parents and themselves decay into radioactive daughters (except for the last chain member which is stable). In order to estimate the radiological impact of sea disposal of the installation, it is necessary to know the quantities of radio nuclides present. particularly those with longer half-lives. The relevant radio nuclides and their half-lives are: radium-226, 1600 years; lead-210, 22.3 years; polonium-210, 138 days; radium-228, 5.75 years; thorium-228, 1.91 years.

<P>3.2.9. Measurements have been made of the concentrations of some radio nuclides in the sludge in the Brent Spar storage tanks. In the case of scale, radio nuclide concentrations can be derived from measurements made on material from the Brent Alpha and the Brent Bravo. The average activity of radium-226 and actinium-228 in the sludge is 4.5 and 3 Bq g-1. respectively. The average activity of radium-226 and actinium-228 in the hard scale is 17.6 and 15.2 Bq g-l, respectively. in the pipework. Conservatively. taking the total masS OFsludge on the Spar to be 100 tonnes and that of scale to be 30 tonnes, and assuming that all the radio nuclides present are in secular equilibrium, gives the following results for the quantities of the longer-lived radio nuclides in both sludge and scale (see Annex for further details).



	<UL>Radionuclide        Activity (GBq)

			Mean	Min	Maximum

	Radium-226	0.98	0.17	2.2

	Lead-210	0.98	0.17	2.2

	Polonium-210	0.98	0.17	2.2
	Radium-22a	0.76	0.12	2.0
	Thorium-228	0.76	0.12	2.0</UL>

<P>3.2.10. These quantities can be placed in perspective by comparing them to calculations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as part of its work to provide the categories of radioactive waste for the purposes of the London Dumping Convention (IAEA, 1986). The IAEA calculated the quantities of radio nuclides which could be disposed of in the deep ocean each year for 1000 years without giving rise to radiation doses exceeding the limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The quantities in the Brent Spar sludge and scale are less than one millionth of those calculated by the IAEA.

<P>3.2.11. For further perspective, a comparison can be made with levels of radio nuclides which are naturally present in sea water. Using ranges of sea water concentrations of radium-226, lead-210, polonium-210, radium-228 and thorium-228 (Pentreath, 1988; IAEA, 1988a), it can be shown that the total quantities of these radio nuclides in Brent Spar sludge and scale are of the order of one hundred millionth to one millionth of those in the water of the North East Atlantic.

Brent Spar Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis  15/12/94


	<P><H4><A NAME="ABBA">4.	SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ABANDONMENT OPERATIONS</A></H4>
	<P>4.1.	Thirteen possible methods of abandonment or re-use were initially put forward for
consideration, of which six were identified as viable options:

<UL>Horizontal Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal)
Vertical Dismantling (and Onshore Disposal)
In-Field Disposal
Deep Water Disposal
Refurbishment and Re-Use
Continued Maintenance</UL>

<P>	4.2.	Of these, horizontal dismantling and deep water disposal were considered in detail to determine the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) for disposal. The BPEO
Assessment demonstrated that the preferable option would be to dispose of the Brent Spar at
an authorised deep water disposal site, on the grounds of reduced technical risk; the reduced
safety risk to the workforce; the insignificant environmental impact; and the total cost.

<P>	4.3.	Prior to deep sea disposal the Spar would be 're-entered', the topsides made safe and the state of the structure evaluated. To minimise the potential environmental impacts at the deep
water disposal site, a clean-up operation involving trained personnel would remove accessible hazardous materials for disposal onshore. This would include fuel oil, lubricants, household items. and where possible, heavy metals and synthetics.

<P>	4.4.	Explosives experts would then board the buoy and place the charges around the ballast tanks, which would eventually be used to sink Brent Spar. The number, weight, type and position of the charges installed would be sufficient to ensure that all air filled compartments flooded,
even if some charges failed to detonate.

<P>	4.5.	Two tugs accompanied by an attendant survey vessel would then tow the buoy to the selected deep sea disposal site, using two of the anchor chains as tow lines. The remaining chains
would be used as emergency tow lines. Three general areas have been identified by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department (SOAFD) as potentially suitable for the
disposal of redundant offshore structures. These are located within U.K. waters and lie in
water depths in excess of 2000 m.



[Figure omitted]

<P>	4.6.	The tow would be conducted
using conventional maritime
practices. All routes from
the Brent Field to the
disposal sites pass to the
north of the Shetland
Islands and to the north
west of the Outer Hebrides.
Whichever site is selected,
the earlier stages of the
planned routes would
essentially be common. The
first part of the tow, to the
200 m contour, would be
subject to detailed survey.
to ensure that the buoy did
not encounter any
unexpected  obstructions.
The route for the latter stage of the tow would depend on the dump site selected: The precise routing would be determined by the requirements for adequate water depth, sufficient clearance from installations and the need for sufficient sea room for manoeuvre should bad weather or accident result in breaking of the-tow.


<P>	4.7.	Prior to sinking the buoy the exact and correct position would be confirmed. The tow vessels would then mechanically release the tow lines and stand off for the detonation of the
explosives by remote control. The charges would be detonated simultaneously, to open the
buoyancy tanks to the sea. This would result in rapid flooding of all the empty tanks which
would remove the remaining buoyancy and sink the structure.








<P><H4><A NAME="DISPOSAL">5. DISPOSAL ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>

<P>5.1. DISPOSAL SITE LOCATION

<P>5.1.1. The location of the three potential deep water disposal sites, identified by SOAFD, are:

	<UL>NAME			CO-ORDINATES

	North Feni Ridge		59deg07'N
				11deg10'W

	Rockall Trough		57deg05'N
				10deg45'W

	Maury Channel		58deg00'N
				22deg30'W</UL>

<P>	5.1.2.	A detailed survey was carried out in August - September 1994 by Shell Expro and SOAFD, to determine the suitability of the proposed disposal sites and, if possible, to identify the
optimum site for disposal of the Brent Spar. The survey also collected baseline data against which any future consequences of the disposal operations could be monitored.

<P>5.2. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

<P>	5.2.1.	The water in the North East Atlantic is continually moving in response to wind,
temperature, and salinity gradients. The flow of the currents set up are moderated and
directed by the physical presence of land masses, the contours of the sea bed and other
bodies of water. The scale of movement is massive and the water moves with immense
inertia. The inflow of water into an area is always counterbalanced by a corresponding
outflow and at one position, water at different depths may be moving in completely
different directions.

<P>5.2.2.  The circulation is influenced by the north easterly movement of warm, saline North Atlantic Drift on the surface, into the Norwegian Sea, and the outflow of dense, cold, water at depth from the Norwegian Basin to the south and west into the Iceland Basin and Rockall Trough.

<P>	5.2.3.	The continental shelf in the NE Atlantic slopes fairly gently down to a depth of c. 200m. At the seaward edge of this shelf, the downward gradient increases on the continental
slope. The base of the slope gives way to the continental rise which leads down to the
abyssal plain, c. 4km deep. The plain may be relatively featureless, with a slope of 1:1000.
In places it may be interrupted by sea mounts (extinct volcanoes), that do not reach the
surface of the water. These features correspond to the ecological zones illustrated.

Brent Spar Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis  15/12/94

[Figure omitted]

<P>5.2.4. The surface waters are isolated from the deep water by the permanent thermocline below which the temperature falls relatively slowly with depth to below 4degC. The depth of the thermocline is generally in the region of 1000m. Above this zone, the water is well mixed and relatively homogeneous. Near the sea bed, there is a layer of homogeneous water, bounded at its upper limit by the Benthic Boundary Layer. This is formed due to the friction of the sea bed against the water and its thickness depends upon the topography of the sea bed but it is generally restricted from 10 - 100 metres above the sea bed (Richards, 1990).

<P>5.2.5. There is relatively sparse information on the bottom current flow in the NE Atlantic. Current velocities are generally lower than those found in surface waters and are typically < 10 cm/sec. For example. in the Rockall Trough, the mean current velocities were only 1 - 2 cm/sec (Metocean, 1993). The flow of cold water from the Norwegian Basin is not constant and is augmented by the semi-diurnal tidal influence, which can increase the current velocity up to 20 cm/sec. The currents are also subject to periodic reversals as the result of persistent mesoscale eddies, thrown off by strong surface flows, like the Gulf Stream. These are large scale phenomena (c. 50-200km) and may persist for two years or so. These eddies produce current velocities of up to 50 cm/sec, giving rise to 'benthic storms' in which vast quantities of sediment may be picked up and re-deposited (Hollister and McCave. 1984).

<P>5.2.6. The rates of sedimentation and the composition of the sediment depends upon the depth of the water. the proximity to land. the productivity of the overlying ocean and the latitude. Siliceous oozes are ubiquitous in the deeper parts of the ocean and are formed from deposition of diatoms. Radiolarian oozes are found in the tropics. and calciferous oozes are formed from foramaniferans in (relatively) shallow water. Within non-productive water masses (e.g. oligotrophic gyres), the main contributors to sedimentation are volcanic and wind blown desert dust which form the so-called 'red clays'. The rate of sedimentation varies between 0.1-0.2 cm per thousand years for the red clays. to 20cm per thousand years on the continental shelf .The mean sediment depth in the North Atlantic is 300-600m, with 1200m in the basins.

<P>5.2.7. Sediment can move downslope due to sediment slides and slumps. debris flows and turbidity currents. Slides and slumps may occur on slopes as low as 2 degrees and may involve large volumes of sediment. Debris flows, the slow movement of sediment downslope, occur on slopes of less than 0.5 degrees. Turbidity currents are high velocity density currents that carry sediment and water down the continental rise and out onto the abyssal plain. There Iis evidence that these phenomena account for the rapid movement of huge amounts of sediment over long distances (Nardin et al., 1979).

<P>5.3. LIVING RESOURCES

<P>5.3.1. Primary production takes place in the upper water of the ocean. In the North Atlantic the diatoms are the main primary producers and their production peaks twice a year, in the early and late summer (Mauchline, 1986). The small plants are grazed by zooplankton, composed predominantly of crustaceans (e.g. copepods and krill), whose numbers peak in the summer, slightly later than the primary producers. These in turn are preyed upon by carnivorous zooplankton, such as medusae, ctenophores, chaetognaths, gymnosomatous and pteropods. Both the herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton provide the major food source for fish.

<P>5.3.2. The abundance of fish depends upon the quantity of food available to them. In general, the deep ocean is not as productive as coastal and shallow waters of the Continental Shelf. Commercially exploited fish in the NE Atlantic include blue fin tuna, redfish, poutassou and various gadoids (ICES, 1992).

<P>5.3.3. At any deep water site, the 'ecosystem' overlying it may be divided into zones differentiated principally by depth. The deeper water fish, living below about 1500 m, are relatively isolated from those above and there is little vertical migration across this boundary. The numbers and density of the surface fish will be determined largely by the production in the near surface water, The deep water animals are, with certain exceptions, entirely dependent, both directly and indirectly, upon the downward flow of material derived from the surface water above (e.g. corpses, faecal pellets etc.).

<P>5.3.4. The fish species found at depth are different from those in shallower water and are adapted to life in the high pressure, dark deep sea environment. The biomass found in oceanic waters decreases with depth so that at 4 km there is only in the order of 1% of that found near the surface. However, within a 100 m or so of the ocean floor, the biomass of animals increases again (Wischner, 1980).

<P>5.3.5. The animals on or near the bottom may be mobile, fixed to the bottom or live in the sediment and many different groups are represented. The animals found may be artificially grouped by decreasing size into the megafauna (also known as epifauna), macrofauna, meiofauna and microfauna. The most conspicuous mobile animals of the megafauna are the fish which are dominated by-the macrourids (rat tails), then the brotulids, sickleheads, deep sea cod and benthopelagic eels. All tend to be general feeders, consuming the epifauna but not the infauna (Gordon, 1987). Also included in this group are the Porifera (e.g. glass sponges), Ceolenterata (e.g. sea firs, sea pens, sea fans and the soft, black and horny corals), Echinodermata (e.g. sea lilies and feather stars), Crustacea (e.g. giant amphipods and decapod crustaceans), together with various species of Annelida, Bryozoa, Brachiopodia and Ascidiacea.

<P>5.3.6. The macrofauna are dominated by the polychaetes (bristle worms), together with the crustaceans and molluscs. The meiofauna are made up of both multi-celled and single celled animals. Of the former, the Nematoda dominate followed by small benthic copepods and ostracods. Of the latter, the most diverse are the Foraminifera (of which there are 6000 known species) and the xenophytophores (giant protozoans). The smallest of all the animals are found in the most superficial layers of sediment and comprise of various flagellates. sporozoans, ciliated amoeba and yeast cells.

<P>5.3.7. The numbers of birds found over deep water are markedly lower that those found nearer shore. The species expected would be Leach's petrel, storm petrel, fulmar, kittiwake and puffin. The highest numbers of birds are found over the shelf break, on the margin between deep water and the edge of the continental shelf, and are generally found during the winter and the early spring.

Brent Spar Abandonment - Impact Hypothesis 15/12/94

<P>5.3.8. Although there are records of seals from far offshore areas, such as Rockall, the only mammals generally found far offshore are whales and dolphins. These animals tend to follow their food and undertake seasonal migrations to the rich feeding grounds in the Arctic and Antarctic waters and to specific breeding grounds in less extreme latitudes. Although widespread in the North Atlantic, they do frequent specific migratory routes. The most used one runs north/south offshore from the continental shelf (Metocean, 1993). The mammals that will use this are the Blue, Fin, North Atlantic Right, Sei, Sperm, Bottle-nosed, Pilot, Humpback and Killer whales.

<P>5.4. RESOURCE USE

<P>5.4.1. One of the main considerations during the selection of potential disposal sites was the use made of the area by other legitimate users of the sea. Potential resource uses in the area of the disposal sites are restricted to fishing, shipping, oil and gas exploration and production, deep sea mining, military activities and sub-sea cables (Metoceon, 1993).

<P>5.4.2. Most fishing activities in these water depths are confined to the upper c. 1000m, although equipment to extend this to c. 1500m is being developed (SOAFD - Personal Communication): Also, most frequently used shipping routes across the Atlantic do pass over the proposed disposal site areas.

<P>5.4.3. Oil and gas exploration and production activities are currently confined to the shallower continental shelf regions. As resources in these areas are depleted, activities will inevitably extend to prospects in deeper water. Sedimentary basins which might contain oil and gas underlie the two inner disposal sites. However, the area of the disposal sites will be small in comparison to the area of these basins and the potential for future conflict small.

<P>5.4.4. The only other mineral resource that has been seriously considered for exploitation is deep sea mining for manganese nodules. The distribution of manganese nodules is highly variable but the most extensive fields lie in the Pacific, and the potential for the North Atlantic appears to be very low. As yet no commercial mining operations have been started anywhere.

<P>5.4.5. No military exclusion zones are located in the disposal site areas. However, the Rockall disposal site is within an area used for submarine exercises.

<P>5.4.6. There are a number of existing and proposed sub-sea cables that cross the disposal site region. However, the location of the disposal sites have been selected to avoid these.

<P><H4><A NAME="FATE">6.	FATE AND EFFECTS OF THE STRUCTURE</A></H4>

<P>6.1. SINKING SCENARIOS

<P>6.1.1. The disposal operation has been designed to ensure that the buoy sinks in the vertical, without any tanks imploding or any debris breaking away. Engineering studies indicate that the structure should remain largely intact upon impact with sea bed, although some damage may occur at the base. The main effects of this would be on the permanent ballast compartment and possibly the lower part of the storage tanks. This would have no affect on the solid ballast (made up of haematite embedded in concrete) but could initiate the slow release of the contents of the storage tanks, immediately after impact. While this is the most likely scenario, there is always some uncertainty in an operation of this type.

<P>6.1.2. For the purposes of the Impact Hypothesis, three possible scenarios are considered as illustrated.

.

<UL>Scenario	Probability	Description 		Contaminant Release
		of		
		Occurring

	1	High	 Buoy sinks to sea bed and remains	Slow release of all 										CONTAMINANTS
		.	largely intact			            into the bottom waters
			.
	2	Medium	Buoy sinks to sea bed and tanks	Fast release of ballast water and
		/Low	rupture on impact with the sea	sludge contaminants into the bottom
			bed				waters. Slow release of structural
							contaminants

	3	Very	 Implosion of tanks as the buoy 	Release of some 10% of the ballast
		Low	sinks				water and sludge contaminants in
							the near surface waters (within 100
							- 200m). As per scenario 2 once the
							buoy is on the sea bed</UL>

<P>	NOTE 1: Should some of the air filled compartments not be flooded as planned, a local rupture could  occur during descent. This would affect the air containing compartment but not the main storage tanks which should remain filled with sea water, throughout. This scenario relates to a hypothetical situation of partial release of the storage tank contents into surface waters. A worst case assumption of a 10% loss of the total tank contents (i.e. equates to over a 50% loss from one tank) has been taken for demonstrative purposes .

<P>6.2. IMPACT OF THE STRUCTURE ON THE SEA BED

<P>6.2.1. The buoy is likely to hit and penetrate the sea bed with the base and then topple on to its side. As the structure approaches the sea bed, the surge preceding it and the impact itself will displace sediments from the impact zone. The sediment cloud produced would drift with the near bottom current while the particles gradually settled back onto the sea bed again. The area affected by the initial impact and subsequent re-deposition of sediment is difficult to forecast accurately.

<P>6.2.2. The minimum area affected by impact would be equivalent to the area of the base of the buoy (approximately 700 m2). plus the area of the buoy when lying on its side (probably up to a maximum of 2,800 m2). Assuming that only the top 10 cm of sediment is displaced to the water column, then some 350 ml of sediment may be re-suspended during the initial impact. Given that most of this material is mud or clay, with settling velocities in the region of 0.002 m/s. current velocities of 0.1 m/s and a sediment cloud of up to 10 -20 m high, most of the material would be expected to resettle within 500 - 1000 m of the point of impact. Studies on disposal of dredged materials confirm that sea bed sediment clouds produced from dumping activities generally persist for short periods of time (Pequegnat, 1983).

<P>6.2.3. Sea bed animals living in the impact zone would be damaged or killed by physical burial or gross disruption of their habitat. Those immediately adjacent to the impact zone (i.e. within 1 -200 metres or so) may be smothered by the re-sedimenting particles. Outside this area, as the cloud spreads radially outwards and becomes more dispersed, any effects on benthic communities will decrease and are unlikely to be detectable beyond one to two hundred metres from the point of bottom contact.

<P>6.2.4. After the impact and resettlement of the sediment, re-colonisation of the newly deposited sediments and the new hard surfaces of the Brent Spar will take place from the surrounding communities. There is evidence to suggest that many deep sea sediment species may be able to survive burial (under 5-6 cm of sediment) and full recovery of the benthic communities can occur within 12 - 24 months (Kukert and Smith, 1992). Thus, the long term effects on the sediment communities from the sea bed disturbance would be negligible. The buoy like other deep sea wrecks, will provide a new surface for fixed animals to grow on, and these in turn will provide a habitat and source of food for mobile animals such as worms, shrimps, crabs and deep sea fish (AURIS, 1994).

.<P>6.3. LONG TERM FATE OF THE STRUCTURE ON THE SEA BED

<P>	6.3.1.	The bulk of the Brent Spar is composed of structural steel (approximately 7,600t) and a solid concrete and haematite ballast (6,800 t). The long term fate of the main hull of the buoy will be largely independent of the state in which the buoy arrives at the sea bed (e.g. whether the
tanks are ruptured), but will depend on the rate of corrosion of steel in the deep ocean. At
the time of disposal, the steel structure is protected by a sacrificial anode system which is
expected to be exhausted within 15 years. Studies have indicated that steel corrodes very
slowly in deep water and anticipated corrosion rates at 4degC would be in the region of 5mm in
1000 years (Metocean, 1993). Assuming a typical hull thickness of 20mm, the structure is
likely to remain largely intact for up to 4,000 years.

<P>6.3.2. Other metallic components of the structure (e.g. copper wire) will also slowly corrode. The concrete/haematite ballast and any wood and plastic within the structure will remain largely intact. Some degradation, leading to mechanical breakdown of these materials would be expected with long term 'weathering' of concrete, biodegradation of wood and leaching of plasticisers from plastics.

<P>6.3.3. Eventually, the hull and contents will collapse, and residual debris will be buried by sedimenting material. Sedimentation rates vary from 0.1-0.2 cm/1000 years in areas of low surface productivity to 20-30 cm/1000 years on the continental slope (Gage and Tyler, 1991). Assuming a sedimentation rate of around 20 cm/1000 years, once the structure has collapsed onto the sea bed, it will take several thousands of years to bury and become part of the deep sea sediment system.

<P>6.4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE STRUCTURE

<P>6.4.1. It is apparent that the structure will remain on the sea bed for several thousands of years before it eventually breaks up into debris and becomes incorporated into the sediment system. Apart from the colonisation of the structure by organisms and the formation of an 'artificial reef', the other potential effects from the physical presence of the structure will be possible impacts on other resource users. This possibility was considered during the site selection process, and the sites eventually chosen satisfied this criteria. The water depth is sufficient to preclude commercial fishing activities, and the proposed locations avoid main shipping routes, amenity areas, military activity, sub-sea cable routes, other disposal sites and prospective areas for oil, gas or minerals.



<P><H4><A NAME="ch4">7. FATE AND EFFECTS OF HYDROCARBONS AND HEAVY METALS</A></H4>

<P>7.1. BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF HYDROCARBONS AND HEAVY METALS

7.1.1. Hydrocarbons and metals are widespread in the oceans, arising from geological, biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The concentration ranges found in nature in sea water and marine sediments are illustrated. Harmful effects on marine organisms may occur if they are exposed to concentrations of metals or hydrocarbons higher than those found in their normal environment.

<P>Note: 1. Neff, Rabalais and Boesch 1987;2. Metocean 1993; 3. Neff and Anderson 1981; 4. Clark 1993.

<P>7.1.2. The intake of hydrocarbons is not essential to any organisms (except certain species of fungi
and bacteria) to sustain their metabolism, although they may be synthesised by some species for various functions (e.g. protective wax on leaves of higher plants, buoyancy in marine
invertebrates). Exposure to petrogenic hydrocarbons can result in a direct physical effect and/or acute or chronic toxic effects, depending upon the quantities encountered. Physical effects are typically seen after the bulk release of oil (cf. slicks occur at concentrations of > 15ppm in still water) when it coats the organism or its environment. The presence of this layer of oil may cause the loss of buoyancy and heat insulation of birds or marine mammals and asphyxiation in invertebrates, fish, birds and marine mammals. Specific components of crude oil can also produce toxic effects. The most potent in this respect are the aromatic and polycyclic aromatic compounds which can represent some 15-20% (by weight) of the oil (Neff and Anderson, 1981). The effects are species dependent; lethal concentrations to fish and marine invertebrates range from 1-500 ppm and sub-lethal concentrations occur at > 1ppb (Capuzzo and Kester, 1987).

<P>7.1.3. Certain metals are essential to the metabolic processes of living organisms. Metals, in particular the heavy metals (i.e. transitional metals + metalloids) can also exert toxic effects. Transition metals (e.g. iron, copper and: manganese) are essential in low concentrations but can be toxic at high concentrations. Metalloids (e.g. mercury, cadmium, chromium and lead) are generally not required for metabolic activity and can be toxic at low concentrations (Clark, 1993). Concentrations of heavy metals that are considered acceptable to protect the marine environment are defined in Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) introduced under the EEC Directive 76/464/EEC. EQS values for key heavy metals
(dissolved) in marine waters are Cadmium - 2.5 microg/l, Mercury - 0.3 microg/l, Lead - 15 microg/l. Chromium - 15 microg/l, Copper - 5 microg/l and Zinc - 40 microg/l (Metocean, 1993; AURIS 1994).

<P>7.1.4. Marine organisms exhibit a range of strategies for dealing with elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons and heavy metals. These vary inter- and intra-specifically depending on the specific metal or hydrocarbon encountered. Some species are capable of partial or complete metal or hydrocarbon regulation, while others resort to accumulation strategies or a  combination of both (Boehm, 1987; Clark, 1993; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987; Waldichuk,1985; Neff, 1979). Some species are able to change the rate of excretion to match the increase in uptake, for example zinc regulation in Palaemon elegans (Rainbow et al., 1990) and regulation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in fish, polychaetes and shrimps (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987). Some marine organisms are able to concentrate contaminants in particular parts of their body. For example, high concentrations of zinc in the jaws of nereids and the jaws of Glycera, and copper accumulation in the gills of Melinna palmara (Clark, 1993). Bivalve molluscs tend to be poor regulators of metals and hydrocarbons and tend to accumulate them when exposed to elevated concentrations. However, when removed from the source of contamination these animals are often able to release the contaminants back to the environment (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Capuzzo and Kester, 1987; Clark, 1993).

<P>7.1.5. Fundamental to producing an adverse effect, the heavy metals and hydrocarbons must be in a form that is biologically available. In the case of metals, this is usually the dissolved ionic form. With hydrocarbons the dissolved or very finely dispersed fractions are generally considered to be 'available'. Metals and hydrocarbons in particulate form in the water column or sediments are seldom directly available to organisms (Boehm, 1987; Waldichuk, 1985). Small amounts may be released into the gut if the particles are ingested, although evidence from deposit feeders suggests that availability through this route is limited (Neff and Anderson, 1981; Waldichuk, 198S). Similarly, metals in their pure form are unavailable to organisms unless they corrode and their corrosion products are soluble in sea water.

<P>7.1.6. The association of heavy metals and hydrocarbons with particulate matter and sediments is well established. Apart from the lower molecular weight aromatic fraction, petrogenic hydrocarbons are generally hydrophobic and tend to associate with particulate material (Boehm, 1987; Mackay and McAuliffe 1988). The association of heavy metals is more complex and depends on factors such as pH, ionic strength and redox state (Salomons, 1992). Of particular importance are the effects of pH; at a low pH metals tend to go into solution and at a higher pH they tend to become associated with particulates. Thus in the open sea, metals will tend to be scavenged from the water by particulate matter.

<P>7.1.7. Metals and hydrocarbons associated with particles entering the sediments are generally considered to be fixed, or firmly bound, unless certain physical (e.g. sediment resuspension), biological (e.g. biodegradation, bioturbation) or anthropogenic (e.g. dumping, aggregate extraction) processes result in their mobilisation. Generally, the upper sediment layers are well mixed to a depth of c. 8 - 10 cm by bioturbation (Smith, 1992). Within this layer, the organics, including hydrocarbons will be subject to aerobic biodegradation. In deeper sediments, where the oxygen demand is greater than supply, a reducing environment exists and anaerobic decomposition of organic material occurs.

<P>7.1.8. The availability of heavy metals and hydrocarbons in sediments will be affected by reduction-oxidation (redox) processes. As oxygen levels decrease, biodegradation of hydrocarbons will effectively cease and unless the sediments are disturbed, they will remain associated with buried sediments. Similarly, most metals will be changed from their oxidised to reduced state (generally insoluble sulphides) and unless exposed to oxygen through some form of disturbance will remain fixed. Iron and manganese are the exception; the sulphides of these metals are more soluble than the oxides/hydroxides. Consequently, iron and manganese will be mobilised into the pore water and diffuse to the upper oxygenated layer where they will be re-deposited as oxides. If the whole sediment is anoxic, then these metals can diffuse and be re-mobilised into the water column. Although manganese and iron are not particularly toxic, their oxyhydroxides can scavenge metals such as copper, zinc and lead from the water. This, together with anaerobic formation of organo-metallic compounds such as tin, mercury and lead, provides a mechanism for making them biologically available (Waldichuk, 1985; Boehm, 1987; Salomons, 1992).

<P>7.2. SLOW RELEASE OF CONTAMINANTS INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>7.2.1. In this scenario, it is assumed that the buoy reaches the sea bed intact and sustains minor damage to one or more of the storage tanks upon impact. It is assumed that the release of contaminated water and sludge starts immediately from small breaches in the tanks and continues at a uniform rate over a period of c. 1000 years, as the remainder of the structure breaks-up. These assumptions are believed to represent a worst case for this scenario, as the predicted corrosion rates indicate that structure may take longer to break-up. It is also quite possible that the sludge may never be released and simply become incorporated into the mass of the disintegrating structure.

<P>7.2.2. Under these conditions, release rates of residual contaminants in the storage tanks would be approximately 0.298 mg/sec - hydrocarbon, 0.00136 mg/sec - copper and 0.00277 mg/sec zinc in the sludge and approximately 0.06 mg/sec - hydrocarbon, 0.028 mg/sec - aluminium and 0.018 mg/sec - zinc in the contaminated water. The other main source of residual contaminants on the structure are heavy metals contained as pure metals or alloys within the structure and equipment. These would be expected to slowly leach as the metals corroded. Of all the metals on the structure, the sacrificial anodes will corrode the fastest, with estimated release rates of 60 mg/sec - aluminium and 19 mg/sec - zinc (Metocean, 1993). Thus, the buoy would act as a very low level chronic point source of hydrocarbons and heavy metals.

<P>7.2.3. Once released to the environment, dissolved materials will be dispersed by the prevailing currents. A proportion of the particulate-bound materials will probably be picked up by the prevailing currents and dispersed; the remainder will settle to the sea bed sediments in the immediate vicinity of the point of release, although some could then be relocated as sea bed load.

<P>7.2.4. The dissolved metals will either associate with particulate material in the water column and enter the sediment system, or disperse to background concentrations in the water column. Estimates of near field dispersion of zinc and aluminium from the anodes indicated that background levels would occur within 100m of the structure (Metocean, 1993). Leakage rates of aluminium and zinc from the storage tanks and corrosion rates of other metallic components would be several orders of magnitude less than the anodes and a similar level of dilution would be expected much closer to the structure. Simple modelling of dispersion of dissolved of finely dispersed hydrocarbons, indicate that background concentrations will be reached within 100m of the structure. Thus, any effects would be limited to organisms on or immediately adjacent to the structure. Evidence from fouling studies on oil and gas installations in the North Sea indicate no adverse effects to organisms living in the immediate vicinity and on sacrificial anodes (AURIS, 1994). This would indicate that any effects within the mixing zone (i.e. between the release point and reaching background concentrations) will be insignificant.

<P>7.2.5. Particulate material will settle to the sea bed at a rate proportional to its particle size and density and become incorporated into the sea bed sediments. The metals and hydrocarbons associated with the sludge would be expected to be tightly bound to the particles and not be immediately available to marine organisms. It is believed that the majority of the sludge is composed of silt and sand which would be expected to quickly settle to the sea bed, immediately adjacent to the point of release. With settling velocities between 0.01-0.07 m/s, current velocities of 10 cm/s and a release height of 15 m, the particulate material would initially be expected to impact the sea bed within 150 m of the release point. Assuming the particles settle with an even distribution within 150 m radius of the point source (i.e. an area of 70,695 m2), a sedimentation rate of 0.2 mm/y and no sediment mixing, re-suspension or degradation processes, the level of hydrocarbons in surface sediments within this localised area would increase by up to two orders of magnitude. With the exception of cadmium which may increase marginally, elevations of the heavy metals would be negligible above sediment background levels.

<P>7.2.6. Sediments contaminated with particulate bound material will be available for re-suspension, redistribution as sea bed load, biodegradation and burial as a result of bioturbation or sedimentation (Gage and Tyler, 1991, Gardener and Richardson.-1992; Smith, 1992; Boehm, 1987). The net effect of these processes would be to redistribute material into the upper layer of sediment and possibly move some of the contaminated material outside the primary deposition area. To provide an indication on the possible accumulation rates a simple box model approach has been used (e.g. Walsh, 1992). Assuming all the material remains in the primary deposition zone (i.e. is uniformly distributed within a 150 m radius of the structure), and that there are no losses, only dilution through bioturbation in the upper 10 cm, this would result in a gradual accumulation of sediment hydrocarbons at a rate of some 20-30% of the background per year, until the source of contamination was exhausted. In reality, most of the particulate-bound materials will be concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the point source and decrease in concentration away from the structure and it is unlikely that elevated sediment hydrocarbons would be detectable much beyond 500m of the structure. Detectable effects on benthic communities have been observed at increases in sediment concentrations of 10 - 60 mg/kg, (Davies and Kingston, 1992). Thus, in this scenario, biological effects would be expected within the immediate vicinity of the structure, probably within 150 - 250 m. These would probably be manifested by a gradual reduction in species diversity and appearance of more opportunist species.

<P>7.2.7. It should be noted that these are conservative assumptions as factors such as re-suspension, biodegradation and burial as a result of sedimentation have been excluded. Biodegradation of the hydrocarbon fraction will occur under aerobic conditions. Data suggests that biodegradation of petrogenic hydrocarbons in sediments is a long term process, occurring on a time scale of years (Rartha and Atlas, 1987). For example, data from oil based cuttings piles in the North Sea, suggest degradation rates in surface sediments of some 25% in 18 months (Mair et al., 1987). Re-suspension may also be an important mechanism for redistributing surface sediments, particularly during periods of 'benthic storms'. It has been suggested that this process can re-mobilise some 10 - 60 % of the biogenic component of the sediment (Walsh, 1992). Eventually, materials entering the sediments will become buried. Typically it has been estimated that some 5% of the biogenic material entering sediments is buried (Walsh, 1992). Each of these processes would serve to further disperse or dilute contaminants, and in the case of hydrocarbons, degrade the small quantities of contaminants present. Taking full account of the likely mode of release of materials contained within the structure, and the factors referred to above, it is unlikely that particulate-bound materials will have any significant impact on the marine sediments outwith the immediate vicinity of the abandoned structure.

<P>7.2.8. The residual hydrocarbon waxes lining the storage tanks would be expected to be fairly inert and resilient to any form of degradation in the anaerobic environment of the storage tanks. Once the structure started to disintegrate through corrosion (several thousand years), then aerobic biodegradation of any residual wax may occur. More likely, the wax will disintegrate with the structure and eventually become incorporated into the sediment system.

<P>7.3. RAPID RELEASE OF CONTAMINANTS INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>7.3.1. In this scenario, it assumes that the storage tanks rupture as the buoy hits the sea bed, releasing the water and sludge over a period of c. 24 hours. Apart from the effects of the rapid release of contaminated water and sludge, the environmental impacts will be the same as those described in the slow release scenario (see Section 7.3). Again, this assumption is believed to represent a worst case for this scenario, as it is highly unlikely that such a rapid release would occur. 




<P>	7.3.2.	The contaminated water will have equilibrated at the temperature of the North Sea bottom waters, which would be around c. 7degC during the summer. Thus, the release of this water at
the sea bed, with temperatures of c. 4degC, will result in a plume that moves with the ambient
current and is also slightly buoyant. The plume will pass through the sediment cloud raised
by the impact of the structure with the sea bed and mix with the ambient sea water. Mixing
with higher pH bottom water will encourage heavy metals in solution to adsorb onto particulate material in the water column. Any remaining soluble hydrocarbons and heavy metals will disperse as the plume slowly moves laterally and vertically. Given the small density differential between the plume and ambient water, the plume would not be expected to rise more than a few tens of metres from the sea bed, but simple dispersion modelling indicates that it could move several hundreds of metres laterally before completely dispersing.
	
<P>7.3.3.	As the plume moves and disperses, it will inevitably encounter, or be encountered, by
bathypelagic fish inhabiting the area. Given the low densities of species living at these
depths (c. 1 per 2,000 m2 ) and the observation that fish appear to be able to avoid areas of
contamination, encounter rates with the plume will be low and of a short duration. Thus,
toxicity thresholds are unlikely to be exceeded and the consequent effects will be negligible.

<P>7 3.4. The sludge would drift with the current and quickly settle to the sea bed. Over the relatively
short period of release, it is conservatively assumed that the current will flow from a single
quadrant at c. 10 cm/sec. As before, the sludge would initially be expected to settle within
some 150 m of the structure, some of it mixing with the sinking sediment cloud displaced as
the structure hit the sea bed. Thus, the sludge would initially cover an area of approximately
17,500 m2, equivalent to loads of some 532 g/m2 - hydrocarbon, 2.43 g/m2  of copper, 0.33
g/m2 of cadmium, 0.51 g/m2 - of lead and 4.95 g/m2 - of zinc being deposited on the
sediments, within the 24 hour release period. Because of the rapid rate of release, it would
be expected that a significant proportion of the contaminated particulate material would be
re-suspended and moved further afield with the sediment load.

<P>7.3.5.	In many ways, this scenario would be similar to a small one-off discharge of oil based mud
and cuttings at an exploration well site and the effects on the benthic communities would be
expected to be similar (e.g. Davies et al., 1984; Boehm, 1987; Yunker et al., 1990). High
levels of hydrocarbons (up-to three orders of magnitude above background) and to a much
lesser extent some of the heavy metals would be found within the primary deposition area,
with concentrations decreasing away from the structure. Measurable levels of hydrocarbons
may be detectable in the sediment up to 1000 m or so from the structure. Biological effects
on sediment organisms would be expected to be more localised, with few observable effects
beyond c.500 m or so. Immediately adjacent to the structure, the benthic fauna would be
highly disrupted by both smothering (from the sludge and sediment displaced during impact
of the structure on the sea bed) and any residual toxicity of the contaminants. Beyond the
contaminated zone, which may extend c.150 - 250 m beyond the structure, the benthic
communities may show reduced diversity, due both to residual contamination and to physical
disruption of the sediments during impact of the structure. Beyond c. 500m, effects are
likely to be undetectable and benthic community diversity similar to background.

<P>7.3.6. Immediately after complete release of the contents of the tanks and deposition of the particulates on the sediments, the recovery process will start. Field studies indicate that affected areas in shallow coastal waters recovered within 3 months, whereas little recovery was apparent at a deeper water site within the same time frame (Yunker er al., 1990). At deeper water sites in the North Sea, there is evidence of the start of recovery in the surface sediments within a period of 18 months of ceasing drilling activities (Mair et al., 1987). It has been suggested that metabolic processes and recovery in the deep sea are slower than rates encountered on the continental shelf (e.g. Grassle and Morse-Porteus, 1987). However, more recent studies suggest that this might be an artefact of the methodology and the rates significantly higher than originally thought (Kukert and Smith, 1992). In comparison with continental shelf regions, the deep sea environment is stable, and apart from the occasional 'benthic storms', has few physical mechanisms to enhance dispersion or degradation of sediment contaminants.

<P>7.4. RELEASE TO NEAR SURFACE WATERS

<P>7.4.1. In this scenario, it assumes that one of the cracks in the damaged storage tanks opens shortly after the buoy leaves the sea surface (i.e. within 100-200m), releasing some 10% of the total water and sludge. Apart from the partial release of contaminated water and sludge near the surface, the environmental impacts once the structure arrives at the sea bed will be similar to one of the two scenarios outlined previously, and subject to the same probabilities of occurrence as specified in Section 6.

<P>7.4.2.In this scenario, the buoy will be sinking vertically through the surface waters, creating an area, of highly turbulent flow around and behind the structure. Thus, any material ejected during descent will be vigorously dispersed vertically over a distance of a few hundred metres. Once in the water column, the relatively high current velocities found in the surface waters of the region (cf. in surface waters currents can be in excess of 75 cm/sec at the surface - Metocean, 1993) would be expected to rapidly disperse and dilute the soluble contaminants to background levels. The sludge would move with the currents and sink to the sea bed. Given the depth of water and typical sinking velocities of silt and sand, the particulates would be dispersed over a distance of several kilometres and effectively diluted to background levels.

<P>7.4.3. Given the relatively small quantities of dissolved material that are considered likely to be released into the water column, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion of released materials, it is unlikely that elevated concentrations of contaminants would persist in the water column for more than a few minutes in the case of heavy metals, and a few hours in the case of the hydrocarbons. The vigorous mixing caused by the movement of the buoy would be expected to disperse any free oil into the water column in a similar way to dispersion and weathering of an oil slick (e.g. Mackay and McAuliffe, 1988). Thus, a surface sheen would not be expected. Potential exposures of pelagic organisms to elevated levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons will therefore be low and the predicted impacts to such organisms would be negligible (AURIS, 1994).

<P>7.5. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HYDROCARBON AND HEAVY METAL RELEASES

<P>7.5.1. The deep ocean has long been considered for disposal of various wastes on the basis that it represents a vast area of unused resource (Angel, 1992; Pequegnat, 1983). Over 50% of the world's surface is located below the 3000 m depth contour. Apart from sub-sea cables, military activities, research, 'experimental mining' and limited dumping, the deep ocean is not utilised by man; currently commercial fishing operations do not extend to depths beyond about 1000 m, although experimental system are being developed to work to 1500 m depths.

<P>7.5.2, In the first two scenarios (i.e. slow release and rapid release) highly localised effects on the environment are predicted. In the slow release scenario, elevated levels of hydrocarbon and heavy metals would be concentrated in the sediment close to the structure, although hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.500 m and biological effects up to 150 - 250 m from the structure. The effects of the rapid release scenario, would follow a similar pattern although the area affected would be expected to be larger (hydrocarbon may be detectable up to c.l000 m and biological effects up to 500 m from the structure) but the effects would be over a much shorter duration. Given the small numbers of organisms present in the deep ocean and low encounter rates with the affected area, effects will be insignificant. Evidence from sites contaminated with oil based mud cuttings on the continental shelf suggests that there are indications of fish tainting (i.e. food chain effects) from fish caught close to sites where extensive drilling operations had occurred but not at sites with low levels of contamination (Davies and Kingston, 1992). Extrapolating these findings to the deep sea environment, this would suggest that food chain effects at the disposal site will not occur.

<P>	7.5.3.	Below about 1500 m, the ocean is relatively isolated from the productive surface waters. The turnover time of water in the deep Atlantic is around 250 years. Primary production occurs in the surface waters and its downward flux provides the only source of food for the deep
ocean. Apart from occasional movements of some species (e.g. deep sea squid) across 'the
1500 m contour', the deep ocean remains relatively isolated from surface waters. Thus,
transfer of contamination from the deep sea system to the shallow water systems is not
considered viable.

<P>7.5.4. In the third scenario, involving partial release of contaminants close to the surface, additional effects would be observed in the water column. The relatively small quantities of material released, the vigorous initial mixing and good dispersion characteristics of the surface waters of the NE Atlantic would quickly reduce contaminant levels to background. No significant effects would be predicted for pelagic organisms within the 'sinking zone'.










<P><h4><A NAME="SCALE">8  FATE AND EFFECTS OF LOW SPECIFIC ACTIVITY SCALE</A></H4>

<P>8.1. APPROACH TO ASSESSMENT OF RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT

<P>8.1.1. When released into the ocean, radio nuclides are subject to the same physical, chemical and biological dispersion, re-concentration and removal processes as stable isotopes of their corresponding elements; the only difference is that the concentrations of radio nuclides will in general decrease with time as a result of their radioactivity. Physical dispersion in the ocean waters occurs through current movements and mixing processes. In the ocean interior radio nuclides interact with organic and inorganic particulates which are moving down through the water column to the ocean floor. Some of these particulates wholly or partially dissolve during their descent, especially at depths below the carbonate saturation depth. releasing radio nuclides adsorbed on them back into the water column. Other particulates dissolve mainly at the ocean floor. At the floor, processes of bioturbation, diffusion in bed sediments, and burial in bed sediments, both return radio nuclides to the water column and remove them to the deeper sediments, which act as a permanent "sink". The degree to which particulate scavenging in the water column and interactions with bed sediments affect radio nuclide concentrations in ocean waters depends on the chemical properties of the relevant element. For example, thorium interacts strongly with particulates and bed sediments, radium much less strongly. In general, scavenging is more important at the ocean edges (i.e. in shelf seas and coastal waters) than in the open ocean, because particulate concentrations are higher closer to land.

<P>8.1.2. Naturally occurring radio nuclides such as those in the Brent Spar sludge and scale are present in the oceans as a result of input from rivers, the atmosphere, and radioactive decay of their parent radio nuclides in the water column and in bed sediments. Cycling of natural radio nuclides in the ocean is used to study oceanographic processes and hence much is known about their behaviour (see for example, Guary et al., (eds) 1988; GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1988a; NEA, 1988; NEA, 1989 and references cited therein).

<P>8.1.3. The most obvious way in which radio nuclides released into the ocean can cause radiation doses to humans is through consumption of seafood, particularly fish, molluscs, crustacea, and to a lesser extent seaweed. These organisms re-concentrate most radio nuclides: for example, the concentration of radium in fish (Bq per tonne) will be about 500 times the concentration in sea water (Bq per cubic metre). Other possible human exposure pathways include consumption of sea salt, consumption of desalinated water, inhalation of sea spray and suspended beach sediments, and external irradiation through boating, swimming and spending time on beaches.

<P>8.1.4. It is assumed for radiological protection purposes that any radiation dose, however small, carries risks to human health, the risks of most concern being the induction of fatal cancer in the individual who receives the dose, and the induction of serious genetic defects in the individual's children. To assess radiological impact on humans it is therefore necessary to estimate potential doses, however small, rather than simply to show that doses will be below some "safe" level. Because radio nuclides released into the ocean disperse over long time scales and large volumes before reaching humans, dose estimates are made using mathematical models.

<P>8.1.5. The disposal site for the Brent Spar has not yet been chosen, although investigations of potential sites are in progress. Furthermore, the quantities of radio nuclides in sludge and scale in the Brent Spar are relatively small (see Section 3.2). Thus, rather than carrying out detailed mathematical modelling, the approach used in this impact hypothesis is to use the results of internationally established models to scope potential doses. Details of the models and the ways in which their results have been used are given in the Annex. The estimated doses to human individuals for each scenario are given in Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5 and
for populations in Section 8.6 below. Potential radiation effects on deep sea organisms are discussed in Section 8.7.


<P>8.2. SLOW RELEASES OF RADIO NUCLIDES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>8.2.1. Two estimates have been made of the radiation doses which might be received by individuals in the scenario where the Brent Spar reaches the ocean floor intact and radio nuclides are released slowly into the ocean as the structure corrodes. One estimate is based on modelling for the 1985 review by the Nuclear Energy Agency of OECD of the continued suitability of the dumping site for radioactive wastes in the North East Atlantic (NEA, 1985). The other estimate is based on IAEA calculations for a generic ocean basin (IAEA, 1986). Details of the assumptions used in the two instances are given in the Annex.

<P>	8.2.2.	Use of the NEA modelling results leads to an estimated maximum annual dose of 
per year to an individual who consumes above-average amounts of seafood. This dose is
predicted to arise 500 years after disposal of the Brent Spar, and to be due to the
consumption of fish and crustacea caught in the Antarctic Ocean. The radio nuclides
contributing to the dose are radium-226 and its daughter products lead-210 and polonium
210. Doses from radium-228 and thorium-228 are predicted to be zero because they will
decay before reaching waters where seafoods are harvested. The time and place of occurrence of the maximum annual dose are determined by the major features of water movement in the Atlantic and its neighbouring oceans. The NEA modelling is based on the view that deep water moves along isopycnal surfaces which, in the case of the Atlantic, outcrop at the poles. In this model the highest concentrations of radio nuclides in surface waters as a result of releases into bottom waters will occur in the Antarctic and Arctic Oceans. Concentrations tend to be higher in the Antarctic because they are made up of contributions from radio nuclides moving north, then west and south, from locations in the deep waters of the North East Atlantic, as well as contributions from radio nuclides moving directly south.

<P>8.2.3. Use of the IAEA modelling results leads to an estimated maximum individual dose of 3 x10 -13
Sv per year to a seafood consumer, again from radium-226 and its daughter products. Doses from radium-228 and thorium-228 are estimated to be zero unless it is assumed that fish living in very deep ocean waters are caught and consumed, in which case the dose is estimated to be 1x 10 -14 Sv per year.

<P>8.3. RAPID RELEASES OF RADIO NUCLIDES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>8.3.1. No specific estimates have been made of the doses which might be received if a fraction of the total activity present in the Brent Spar was released rapidly into bottom waters, as a result of damage to the structure caused by its impact on the ocean bed. Examination of the features of the models used by NEA and IAEA. shows that they would predict doses of the same order as those given in Section 8.2 for a rapid release, because in both cases doses depend more on rates and patterns of dispersion in the ocean than on rates of release into the ocean, provided the latter are rapid.

<P>8.4. RELEASE TO NEAR-SURFACE WATERS

<P>8.4.1. Dose estimates for a scenario in which some implosion occurs during the descent of the Brent Spar to the ocean bed have been made using an approach based on a model developed for a European Community project to evaluate the radiological impact of radioactivity in northern European marine waters (the MARINA project-CEC, 1990). Details of the calculational approach are given in the Annex. Assuming that 10% of the activity in sludge and scale is released during descent, and in the extreme case, that all of this activity reaches coastal waters to the west of Scotland, the maximum dose to a seafood consumer is estimated so be 9x10-9 Sv per yR

<P>8.5. COMPARISONS WITH DOSE LIMIT AND EXEMPTION LEVEL

<P>8.5.1. The significance of the doses estimated above needs to be judged in two ways: first to determine whether they are below the level which is regarded as intolerable, and second to determine whether they are potentially acceptable. The dose limit recommended by ICRP for members of the public is 1 mSv per year (10 -3 Sv per year) (ICRP, 1991). This limit is for all practices which can lead to radiation exposure of the public, except for medical procedures, and represents the level above which doses would be regarded as intolerable. The doses estimated above for the release to bottom waters scenario (Section 8.2) are less than one billionth of the ICRP limit, and the dose estimated for the release to near-surface waters scenario (Section 8.4) is less than one hundred thousandth of the limit. It is therefore clear that any doses arising from the ocean disposal of the Brent Spar would not remotely approach the limits of tolerability recommended by ICRP.

<P>8.5.2. To judge the potential acceptability of the doses, the most relevant level is that given in an IAEA document on principles for exemption of radiation sources and practices from regulatory control (IAEA, 1988b). This document states that a radiation dose to an individual is likely to be regarded as trivial if it is of the order of 10 microSv per year (10 -5 Sv per year), and it is understood that IAEA will be using such a dose level in their work to define wastes which can be regarded as non-radioactive for the purposes of the London Dumping Convention. The doses estimated above for the release to bottom waters scenario (Section 8.2) are less than one ten millionth of the IAEA exemption level, while the dose for the release to near-surface waters scenario is less than one thousandth of the exemption level. It can therefore be concluded that doses to individual members of the public from disposal of the Brent Spar are well within the potentially acceptable range, and are well below the levels which have been suggested as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control

<P>8.5.3. For further perspective, the estimated doses can be compared to those which could be received from radio nuclides naturally present in sea water. The annual dose from such radio nuclides to a person who consumes above average amounts of seafood could be 2 - 5 mSv per year (2-5 x 10-3 Sv per year)(Pentreath 1988 and Annex to this report), that is a factor of over 200,000 greater than the highest individual dose estimated from disposal of the Brent Spar.

<P>8.6. DOSES TO HUMAN POPULATIONS

<P>8.6.1. Within the framework of radiological protection, estimates of doses to human populations ("collective doses") are used in determining compliance with the requirements that practices causing radiation exposure should be justified, and that all exposures should be as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account (the ALARA or optimisation requirement) (ICRP, 1991). There are no limits on collective doses as there are for individual doses. However, the IAEA has suggested a level of collective dose to be used in determining whether practices might be exempted from regulatory control. This level is in terms of the collective dose which would be received by the whole exposed population, integrated over all time, from one year of carrying out the practice, and is 1man Sv (IAEA, 1988b).

<P>8.6.2. In the case of radio nuclide releases into the oceans the population to be considered in collective dose calculations is that of the world. Clearly it is not possible to calculate the dose to every person in the world, for every year after the release, and sum them to obtain the collective dose. The procedure is to calculate radio nuclide concentrations in seafoods in each part of the ocean, as a function of time, using mathematical models. Seafood catch data for each part of the ocean are then used to estimate the total amounts of radio nuclides in seafoods potentially available for human consumption, and it is assumed that all the edible parts of the seafoods are consumed. This procedure has been used in studies with the NEA model, and in the European Community MARINA project, and the results are employed here to make very rough, pessimistic estimates of the collective doses to the world population, integrated over all time, from disposal of the Brent Spar (see Annex for details)


<P>8.6.3. The estimated collective doses are 0.09 man Sv for release of all the activity in the Brent Spar to bottom waters, and 0.02 man Sv for release of 10% of the activity to near-surface waters. These values, which have been derived by methods which err on the side-of caution, are less than one tenth of the IAEA suggested exemption level of 1man Sv. They may also be placed in perspective by comparing them to the annual collective dose to the world population from natural radio nuclides in sea water of 300,000 man Sv (NEA, 1985). As with individual doses, it can be concluded that population doses from disposal of the Brent Spar are likely to be acceptable.

<P>8.7.		RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON DEEP SEA ORGANISMS

<P>8.7.1.		Organisms in the deep ocean are exposed to radiation from radio nuclides naturally present in sea water and sediments. The most straightforward way to assess potential radiation
effects on organisms from the disposal of the Brent Spar is to determine whether,
immediately around the structure, radio nuclide releases from sludge and scale will increase
background radiation levels significantly.

<P>8.7.2.		The IAEA has developed a methodology for the calculation of doses to deep sea organisms from radio nuclide releases into bottom waters (IAEA, 1988a). Using this methodology, it is estimated that the maximum dose rate to deep sea organisms in the case of a slow release of
radio nuclides from the Brent Spar would be about 3 nSv per hour (3 x 10 - 9 Sv per hour - see
Annex). Natural background dose rates to these organisms are in the range 10 nSv per hour
(10 -8 Sv per hour) to 5,000 nSv per hour (5x 10-6 Sv per hour) (NEA, 1985; IAEA 1988a). It
can therefore be-concluded that in this instance it is highly unlikely that there will be
radiation effects on deep sea organisms at the individual or species population level. More
rapid releases would lead to dose rates higher than 3 nSv per hour (3x10-9 Sv per hour), but
these would persist for shorter times and would be within the background range. Thus in
these cases too, it is very unlikely that there will be effects on natural fauna.

<P>8.8.		ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF LSA SCALE RELEASES
<P>8.8.1.		The results from studies using internationally established mathematical models have been used to estimate the radiation doses which could be received by human individuals and
populations from radio nuclides released from the Brent Spar.

<P>8.8.2.		The estimated doses to individuals are several orders of magnitude less than a level of dose defined by the IAEA as a basis for exemption of sources and practices from regulatory
control. The estimated collective (population) doses are also well within an IAEA exemption
level. These dose estimates are approximate but have been derived by methods which err
generally on the side of caution. They are based on calculated average activity levels in
sludge and scale; use of calculated maximum activity levels would not lead to doses
significantly above those estimated.

<P>8.8.3.		It has also been shown that disposal of the Brent Spar is very unlikely to lead to radiation effects on deep sea organisms at either the individual species or the population levEL

<P><H4><A NAME="CON">9. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY IMPACT HYPOTHESIS</A></H4>
<P>	9.1. The impacts of three sinking scenarios have been considered for the Brent Spar. The most likely scenario is that the buoy will sink to the sea bed and remain largely intact after
impact. This would be followed by a slow release of the residual contaminants from the
storage tanks to the deep ocean waters and sediments. The alternative of major damage to
the storage tanks (and fast release of contaminants) on impact is considered less likely to
occur. The third alternative of tank damage (and release of contaminants in the near surface
environment) is considered unlikely to occur. The potential environmental impacts from
each of these scenarios, is an extremely localised effect which, when considered in the
context of the size of the ocean, will be of negligible significance.

<P>      9.2.	The Impact Hypothesis for the most likely scenario is summarised in the following
paragraphs. The buoy will sink vertically, due to the weight of the ballast in its base and hit
the sea bed base first. The buoy would be expected to penetrate the surface layers of
sediment (the extent depending on the precise characteristics of sea bed at the disposal site)
and topple onto its side. The surge preceding impact, and the impact itself will displace
surface sediments from the impact zone into the water column. The sediment cloud
generated would move with the bottom currents and be re-deposited on the sea bed within
500 - 1000 m of the impact zone. Burial of the sea bed communities will be inevitable in the
immediate area of impact. Smothering from the sediment cloud will also occur within 100 -  
200 m of the impact zone. Beyond this area effects would be small.

<P>	9.3.	After impact and resettlement of the sediment, re-colonisation of the disturbed sediments and new hard surfaces of the buoy itself will start from the surrounding communities. Recent evidence on recovery of disturbed sediments in the deep sea suggest that this process will
take place relatively quickly, over a 12 - 24 month period.

<P>	9.4.	The steel structure of the hull and other metallic components will also start to corrode at an estimated rate of some 5 mm/1000 years. This means that the structure is likely to remain largely intact for some 4,000 years. The concrete ballast, and any wood or plastic would
remain largely intact although some degradation and mechanical breakdown may occur
within these long time scales. Eventually, the structure would collapse onto the sediment
surface and any residual debris eventually become buried under the slowly depositing
sediments in 5 - 10,000 years. 

<P>	9.5.	The relatively small quantities of hydrocarbons and heavy metals remaining on the structure will slowly leach into the water column from the storage tanks and the remainder of the
structure as it corrodes. Dissolved metals or hydrocarbons will disperse to background levels
within c. 100 m of the structure. Contaminated particulate material from the storage tanks
will initially be deposited within c. 150 m of the structure and enter the sediment system.
Disregarding any processes which would subsequently disperse or degrade sediment
contaminants, conservative estimates indicate that hydrocarbon and to a much lesser extent
the heavy metal concentrations would be expected to slowly increase in the sediments immediately adjacent to the structure. It is unlikely that elevated sediment hydrocarbons
would be detectable much beyond 500m of the structure. Detectable effects on benthic
communities would be expected within the immediate vicinity of the structure, probably
within 150 - 250 m. These would probably be manifested by a gradual reduction in species
diversity and appearance of more opportunist species.

<P>	9.6.	LSA scale is composed predominantly of barium sulphate, with smaller quantities of calcium and barium carbonates. In the deep ocean, some dissolution of the calcium salts would be
expected. Thus, some of the naturally occurring radioactive elements may also go into solution, whilst the others would be expected to remain in the particulate phase. Conservative modelling of the long-term fate of the radioactive materials in the scale, indicate that the estimated dose rates to individuals (human) would be several orders of magnitude less than those regarded by the IAEA as de minimus for the purposes of regulatory control. Similarly, dose rates to human populations would be well within those acceptable to IAEA. The dose rates to deep sea organisms would be within the ranges encountered in nature and effects on natural populations would not be expected.

<P>A.1. RADIO NUCLIDE CONTENT OF SLUDGE AND SCALE

<P>A.l.l. Most measurements of the radioactive content of sludge and scale have been to determine concentrations of the two radio nuclides which are of most concern in an operational context, namely radium-226 and actinium-228. For sludge in the Brent Spar storage tanks the measurements give an average radium-226 concentration of 4.5 Bq g-1, with a range of 1.2 to 8.0 Bq g -1, and an average actinium-228 concentration of 3.0 Bq g-l, with a range of 0.8 to 5.2 Bq g -1. Estimates of activities in hard scale in the Brent Spar have been made from records of on-shore disposals of scale from Brent Alpha and Brent Bravo. These give an average radium-226 concentration of 17.6 Bq g -l, with a range of 1.7 to 46.6 Bq g-1, and an average actinium-228 concentration of 15.2 Bq g -1, with a range of 1.3 to 50.8 Bq g -1.

<P>A.1.2. For the radiological impact estimates it is necessary to know the concentrations of the long-lived radio nuclides, namely radium-226 and its daughter products lead-210 and polonium-210, and radium-228 (parent of actinium-228) and thorium-228 (daughter of actinium-228). Activities of lead-210, polonium-210, radium-228 and thorium-228 in sludge and scale are not measured routinely. However, there are results of gamma counting measurements available for lead-210, polonium-210 and thorium-228 in Brent Alpha scale/sludge. These results indicate that an assumption that radio nuclides are in secular equilibrium (i.e. that the activities of parent and daughter radio nuclides are equal) would be conservative. Hence, for the impact assessment it is assumed that concentrations of lead-210 and polonium-210 are equal to those of radium-226, and that concentrations of radium-228 and thorium-228 are equal to those of actinium-228. This assumption, together with assumed quantities of 100 tonnes sludge and 30 tonnes scale, leads to the estimates of activities in Brent Spar materials given in Section 3.2 of the main text.

<P>A.2. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON HUMANS OF RADIO NUCLIDE RELEASES INTO BOTTOM WATERS

<P>A.2.1 Throughout the calculations, the activities in sludge and scale are considered together and it is assumed that radio nuclides are released from the Brent Spar into the ocean in soluble form, rather than as particulates which settle to the ocean floor. This assumption is pessimistic, particularly for hard scale.

<P>A.2.2 For estimation of individual and collective doses from disposal of the Brent Spar use is made of the results of modelling studies for the disposal site for radioactive waste in the North East Atlantic (NEA 1985, Smith et al 1987). These studies employed a model for radio nuclide movement in the ocean which was developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) in the UK. Since the model was developed for the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) review of the continued suitability of the North East Atlantic site, it is referred to here as the NEA model.

<P>A.2.3 The model is of the compartment type and is one of the sorts of model recommended for use in GESAMP Report 19 (GESAMP, 1983). It consists of a model to predict rates and patterns of dispersion of radio nuclides by physical processes (advection and diffusion) and, overlaid on this, a model to represent radio nuclide interactions with particulates in the water column and with bed sediments (NEA, 1985). Apart from those representing waters immediately above the disposal site, the compartments in the model are defined to correspond with isopycnal surfaces (surfaces of constant density) in the oceans. This approach is used because water movement in the ocean is thought to occur primarily along, rather than across, these surfaces. There are 92 compartments in the model, of which 68 represent the Atlantic and 24 represent the Pacific. Antarctic, Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea The compartment structure of the model is shown in Figure Al; Figures A2 and A3 show the flow fields in the Atlantic which are represented through exchanges between compartments in the model. These exchanges were calculated from a general understanding of the oceanographic features of the Atlantic and knowledge of the existing distributions of conservative tracers (salinity and temperature). The structure of the model compartments around the disposal site is shown in Figure A4.


<P>A.2.4 The sediment interaction part of the model is based on the work described in GESAMP Report 19. The model includes scavenging of radio nuclides by particles in the ocean interior, and bioturbation, diffusion and burial in sediments at the ocean boundaries (see Figure A5). The basic assumptions made in the model and its main features are as follows:

<UL>* particulates within the water column can be represented as two types: small (less than 50 micro m) and large (greater than 50 micro m); 

* all particulates contain a 20% insoluble fraction;

* the concentration ratio between activity on particulates and dissolved radio nuclides is assumed to be constant (the equilibrium approximation, which enables distribution coefficients, Kd values, to be used in modelling);

* small particles dissolve linearly with depth below the carbonate saturation depth, large particles dissolve on the ocean bed; 

* interior scavenging is parameterized using settling velocities and particle concentrations.</UL>

<P>	A.2.6 Interactions with bottom sediments are modelled by adding compartments to each of the bottom compartments of the dispersion model. These represent the sediment-water interface, the bioturbated zone, the sediment where mixing is due to pore water diffusion, and the
deeper sediment which acts as a permanent sink for radio nuclides (see Figure A5). Interactions with suspended sediments in the ocean interior are modelled by including extra transfer coefficients between compartments of the dispersion model.

<P>		A.2.7 The model for radio nuclide movement provides estimates of radio nuclide concentrations In	sea water in each region of the world's oceans, as a function of time after the start of release of radio nuclides into the oceans. Radiation doses to individuals are then calculated by
considering those whose habits are such that they could incur higher doses than members of
the population as a whole, via potential exposure pathways arising from disposal. Such
groups are known as 'critical groups', not because they are at any particular risk but in the
sense that so long as they are properly protected, the population as a whole will be
safeguarded automatically. The exposure pathways considered in the NEA studies (and in
IAEA work, see Section A.3) cover internal irradiation via ingestion and inhalation of radio
nuclides, and external irradiation, and include both "actual" pathways (i.e. ones which could
exist now) and "hypothetical" pathways (i.e. ones which might exist in future). The exposure
pathways considered are as follows:

<P>	Actual pathways
		
<UL>* Ingestion: consumption of surface water fish, mid-depth water fish, crustacea, molluscs,
seaweed, salt, desalinated water.

* Inhalation: breathing in marine aerosols (sea spray) and suspended airborne sediments (on
beaches).

* External irradiation: during boating. swimming, spending time on beaches, and (through
participation in deep sea mining of ferromanganese nodules.</UL>    


<P>	Hypothetical pathways

<P>* Consumption of plankton, consumption of deep water fish.

<P>* For collective (population} doses only "actual" seafood consumption pathways are considered. Details of the parameter values used in the dose calculations are given in NEA (1985).

<P>* The doses which could be received by individuals following disposal of the Brent Spar (see Section 8.2 - 8.4 of the main text) are derived by straightforward scaling of results given in NEA 1985 for disposal of radium-226. These results indicate a peak dose from radium-226 and its daughter products, summed over actual seafood consumption pathways, of 8.3 x 10-11 Sv per year per TBq of radium-226 disposed. The peak dose is predicted to arise 500 years after disposal, from seafoods caught in the Antarctic Ocean. It should be noted that this method of estimating the doses from disposal of the Brent Spar implicitly assumes that radio nuclides associated with the Spar initially will be released slowly over periods of the order of 1000 years. It also assumes that peak doses are not dependent on the location of the disposal site within the North East Atlantic. The first of these assumptions is not unreasonable. The second could lead to underestimation of Brent Spar doses, but it should be borne in mind that other aspects of the IAEA model are conservative, particularly the implied assumption that individuals actually eat substantial quantities of seafood caught in the Antarctic Ocean. In the Brent Spar dose calculations, no allowance is made for reductions in dose per unit intake factors for radio nuclides as a result of the 1990 recommendations of ICRP (ICRP, 1991; Phipps et al., 1991)

<P>* The collective dose which could be received following disposal of the Brent Spar is derived using results given in Smith et al 1987 for sea dumping of unit activity of uranium-238. Only radium-226 is considered for the Brent Spar and it is assumed that consumption of fish is the dominant population exposure pathway. The collective dose incurred up to 104 years after dumping of uranium-238 is used, to make allowance for the difference in half-lives of radium-226 (1600 years) and uranium-238 (4.5 109 years). The calculations give two estimates of the collective dose to the world population, integrated over all time, from disposal of the Brent Spar: 0.09 man Sv and 5 x 10 -5 man Sv. Only the higher value is used in the main text (Section 8.6).

<P>USE OF IAEA MODELLING RESULTS

<P>A second estimate of the individual doses which could be incurred from slow releases of radio nuclides from the Brent Spar into deep ocean waters is made using the results of IAEA modelling (IAEA, 1984; IAEA, 1986). These models were developed by the IAEA in support of the London Dumping Convention and are described in Appendices VI and VII of GESAMP Report 19 (GESAMP, 1983) and deal with radio nuclide movement in a notional ocean basin.

<P>The Appendix VII model is three-dimensional and is based on the assumption that physical dispersion in the ocean occurs only by diffusion. The model was developed primarily to predict the extent of the region of elevated contaminant concentrations around a source and will underestimate the degree of dispersion by physical processes unless sufficiently large eddy diffusion coefficients are chosen. The model includes interior scavenging (i.e. removal of radio nuclides from the water column by adsorption on to falling particulates) and boundary scavenging (i.e. burial by accumulating sediments, diffusion in sediment pore water and mixing within the bioturbated layer). Analytical solutions to the equations are available for the steady state situation (GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1984) and it is these which were used in the IAEA calculations (IAEA, 1986).

<P>A.3.3 The Appendix VI model is one dimensional and is an equilibrium version of the more complex model described in Appendix IX of GESAMP Report 19. As well as diffusion. boundary scavenging and interior scavenging, it includes up welling of water and a corresponding downward movement. This feature means that the model is able to reproduCE fluxes of substances which are recycled between the surface and the deep ocean, and hence that the model is particularly useful for estimating concentrations of long-lived radio nuclides which are not very strongly adsorbed on particulates or bottom sediments. Despite its one-dimensional nature, the model provides adequate estimates of laterally averaged concentrations. As with the Appendix VII model, analytical solutions are available for the steady state situation (GESAMP, 1983; IAEA, 1984).

<P>A.3.4 The IAEA used the Appendix VI and Appendix VII models to calculate the rates of release of radio nuclides into the ocean which, if continued for 1000 years, would lead to peak doses to individuals equal to the ICRP limit of  1 mSv per year (10 -3 Sv per year)(lAEA, 1986). The exposure pathways considered in these "release rate limit" calculations are the same as those in the NEA modelling (see Section A.2 above), as are the values of the parameters for these pathways. The sediment/water distribution coefficients (Kd values) and concentration factors for biological materials used in the IAEA calculations (IAEA, 1985) are, for almost all radio nuclides, the same as those in the NEA modelling (NEA, 1985). The release rate limits for each radio nuclide given by the IAEA are the lower of the values calculated with the Appendix VI and Appendix VII models.

<P>A.3.5 For the five radio nuclides of interest in the Brent Spar situation the IAEA release rate limits are:

<UL>	Radium-226	3 3 x 10 3 TBq y-1

	Lead-210	2.7 x 10 6 TBq y-1

	Polonium-210	1 3 x 10 8 TBq y-1

	Radium-228	6.4 x 10 4 TBq y-1

	Thorium-228	2.6 x 10 8 TBq y-1</UL>

<P>A.3.6 Assuming that the radio nuclides in Brent Spar sludge and scale are released at a uniform rate over a period of 1000 years, and scaling the release rate limits by the quantities of each radio nuclide in the Brent Spar, produces the dose estimates given in Sections 8.2 - 8.4 and 8.6 of the main text. The radio nuclide which gives rise to the highest dose is radium-226, for which the release rate limit is based on the Appendix VI model and is largely determined by the dose incurred from consumption of fish caught at a depth of 1500m. Since the Appendix VI model is one-dimensional and does not include movement of water (and hence radio nuclides) from one ocean basin to another it is not surprising that the Brent Spar dose derived from the IAEA release rate limits (3 x 10 -13 Sv y-1) is higher than that derived from NEA modelling (8 x 10 -14 Sv y -1). The volume and depth of the North East Atlantic are somewhat smaller than those of the notional ocean basin considered in the IAEA calculations (the volume and depth of the North East Atlantic are 5 x 10 16 m3 and 3.5 km respectively, while those of the IAEA notional ocean basin are 1 x 10 l7 m3 and 4 km). No allowance is made for these differences in deriving the Brent Spar doses because the factor involved (less than 2) is outweighed by the pessimism of the implicit assumption that fish caught at a depth of 1500m in the Antarctic are consumed in substantial quantities.

<P>A.4. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE RADIOLOGICAL IMPACT ON HUMANS OF RADIO NUCLIDE RELEASES INTO NEAR-SURFACE WATERS

<P>A.4.1 For the scenario in which some implosion is assumed to occur during the descent of the Brent Spar to the ocean floor, the approach used to estimate doses is based on parameter values in, and results from, a model developed for the Commission of the European Communities MARINA project (CEC, 1990: Charles et al., 1989). This model, known as MARIN1, is designed to estimate doses from liquid effluents discharged into north European waters from nuclear installations on land. The model is of the compartment type and its structure is shown in Figures A6 and A7.

<P>A.4.2 To estimate individual doses it is assumed that 10% of the activity in Brent Spar sludge and scale is instantaneously released into near-surface waters above its disposal site, and that this activity moves rapidly into the area of sea represented by the "Scottish Waters" compartment in the MARIN1 model (see Figure A7). Peak concentrations in sea water where seafoods are caught are calculated by assuming that radio nuclides arc dispersed throughout Scottish Waters, without any removal by particulate scavenging or radioactive decay. It is then assumed that these peak concentrations persist for at least one year, and doses to persons consuming seafoods caught in Scottish Waters are calculated using the same parameter values as in the NEA and IAEA modelling (Section A.2).The Scottish Waters compartment of the MARINl model is relatively small and shallow (volume 1.3 x 10 13 m3, depth 110m) and current flows through it are such that the assumption that peak radio nuclide concentrations persist for a year is pessimistic (see exchange rates given in Figure A7). The total calculated individual dose of 9 x 10 -19 Sv y -l (see Sections 8.2 - 8.4 and 8.6) arises mainly from polonium-210 (7.5 x 10 -9 Sv y- l ) and lead-210 (1.3 x 10 -9 Sv y-l ),

<P>A.4.3 To estimate collective doses for the Brent Spar scenario, use is made of MARIN1 collective dose results for unit discharge of uranium-238 from a land based site on the west coast of the British mainland (Charles et al., 1989), ratios of the collective doses from unit discharge of radium-226 and uranium-238 derived from Klos et al., 1989, and ratios of collective doses to the European and world populations given in Smith et al., 1987. From Charles et al, the collective dose to the European population, integrated over all time, from discharge of lBq of uranium-238 from Springfields is 1.9 x10-13 man Sv. From Smith et al., for unit discharge of uranium-238 into UK coastal waters about 73% of the total collective dose will be incurred by the European population and about 27% by the rest of the world population. From Klos et al., collective doses per unit discharge of radium-226 and uranium-238 are in the ratio of 890:1. Simple multiplication gives a collective dose of 0.02 man Sv to the world population for the Brent Spar scenario in which 9.3 x 10 7 Bq radium-226 is released.

<P>A.5. MODELLING TO ESTIMATE RADIATION DOSES TO DEEP SEA ORGANISMS

<P>A.5.1 As part of their work for the London Dumping Convention, the IAEA developed a methodology for the calculation of doses to deep sea organisms from releases of radio nuclides into bottom waters (IAEA, 1988). In this methodology the GESAMP Appendix VII and Appendix VI models (see Section A.3) are used to calculate radio nuclide concentrations in bottom waters and sediments, and simple dosimetric models are then used to obtain the dose rates to various types of marine organisms.

<P>A.5.2 From Table A-III in IAEA (1988), the maximum dose rates to deep sea organisms per unit concentration of the Brent Spar radio nuclides in sea water are as follows.


	<UL>	Radionuclide	Dose rate (micro Sv h-1/Bq m-3)

		Radium-226	0.6 

		Lead-210	3.0

		Polonium-210	0.3	

		Radium-228	0.005

		Thorium-228	5.0</UL>



<P>A.5.3 Using the GESAMP Appendix VII model with the assumption that radio nuclides are released at a uniform rate over a period of 1000 years, and taking the "radius of the source" to be 70m (about half the height of the Brent Spar), the concentrations of these radio nuclides in bottom waters close to the Brent Spar are 4.3 x 10 -4 Bq m for radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210, and 3.5 x 10 -4 Bq m-3 for radium-228 and thorium-228. Hence the maximum dose rate to deep sea organisms from all five radio nuclides is 3 nSv h-1. (3 x 10 -9 Sv per hour)

<P>A.6. NATURAL BACKGROUND DOSES FROM RADIO NUCLIDES IN THE OCEAN

<P>A.6.1 From IAEA (1988) natural background concentrations in sea water of the five radio nuclides of concern in the Brent Spar calculations are as follows (units are Bq m - 3):

<UL>	Radium-226	1.3 - 3.1

	Lead-210	0.4 - 5.0
.

	Polonium-210	0.19 - 3.7

.
	Radium-228	0.04 - 3.7

	Thorium-228	0.007 - 0.12</UL>

<P>A.6.2 Based on these concentrations and using the same parameter values as in the NEA and IAEA modelling (see Sections A.2 and A.3), the dose to a person who consumes above average quantities of seafood is calculated to be 0.3 - 5 mSv y-1 (0.3 - 5.0 x 10 -3 Sv per year). Most of this dose arises from polonium-210. The estimated dose of 2 mSv y-1 (2 x 10 -3 Sv per year) given in Pentreath (1988) lies within this range.

<P>A.6.3 The collective dose to the world population from natural radio nuclides in the ocean, based on average radio nuclide concentrations and seafood catch data for the early 1980s, is estimated to be 3 x 10 5 man Sv per year (NEA, 1985).

<P>A.6.4 Table IX of IAEA 1988 gives the range of natural background dose rates to deep sea organisms as 10 nSv h-l to 5 microSv h-l (l0-8 to 5 x 10 -6 Sv per hour).
