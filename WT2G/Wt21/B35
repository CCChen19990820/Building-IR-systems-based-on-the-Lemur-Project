<H2>The London Club</H2>
<P>
<B>The London Club </B>exists to offer third party liability insurance
to shipowners,
operators and charterers on a mutual,
non-profit basis. 
<P>
The London Club is one of the leading P&amp;I Clubs in the International Group, which
together insure the vast majority of the world's
merchant shipping, and handle claims ranging from crew sickness or cargo damage to
the full cost of oil spills such as the <I>Sea Empress</I>.
<P>
The Club provides <A HREF="re_p_i.htm"<A HREF="re_p_i.htm" onMouseOver="self.status='Information on the insurance cover offered by the London Club'; return true"> P&amp;I </A> ("protection and indemnity")
insurance to the owners and operators of a fleet
totalling more than thirty million gross tons. These are drawn from shipowning
countries which include Chile, China, Greece, Hong
Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Monaco, Singapore, Turkey, UK and USA.
The Club has strong membership in Greece and
the Far East, and a growing presence in Latin America. Almost half of the membership
is also covered by the <A HREF="re_p_i.htm"<A HREF="re_p_i.htm" onMouseOver="self.status='See our page of information on the insurance cover offered'; return true"> FD&amp;D </A> Class ("freight, demurrage and defence") which the Club offers.

<H3>Fair dues</H3>
PROMPT payment of calls is an important aspect of the mutuality on which P&I
clubs rest, according to Lance Johnson, claims director. "The bulk of our members pay their calls on time and appreciate the consequences of any failure to do so," says Mr Johnson. "They understand they are pooling their funds and resources on a mutual basis. It would be unfair on the whole membership if a member failed to pay by the due date."
<P>
Mr Johnson says premium income for the International Group is almost $1.65bn,
and the London Club's annual premium is about $103m. "These are substantial
sums and one measure of a Club's efficiency is the promptness with which it gets the premium revenue in. We work hard to develop a real understanding of member's needs," says Mr Johnson. 
<P>
"Sometimes, some shipowners can misinterpret that as being soft on collecting
dues. But we would be failing in our duty to our members if we didn't act swiftly to ensure members pay on time." The London Club prides itself on having the lowest debtors to premiums ratio in the International Group, which is the other side of the coin to having one of the best reputations for service and working closely with members.
<P>
Calls are collected against debit notes which are issued for two instalments of advance calls. If members do not pay by the due date, they prejudice their P&I cover, claims files may not be handled, claims will not be reimbursed and the provision of security will not be considered. Interest may also be charged for the period that the payment remains overdue. 
<P>
Mr Johnson says there are occasional extreme cases where a member simply does
not pay. "In those cases we issue a notice of cancellation, followed by legal
proceedings on an international basis which may lead to an eventual arrest of
vessels. Fortunately, fair dues prevail and we don't have to do this often."

<H3>Keeping healthy</H3>

IF MEMBERS rely on local agents to inform local P&I correspondents of problems, they face the danger that the message may not get through. A recent case in which a sick seafarer was hospitalised in the USA with a serious illness could have had serious financial consequences for the shipowner. "In this case, the seafarer recovered," says Ernie Chaplin, assistant director responsible for crew claims. "But the member did not let us know until the treatment was well advanced. It was a very serious case and we would have used a healthcare management service to oversee the treatment, and the costs, if we had known."
<P>
Under Rule 17.1 and 17.1.1, members are obliged to notify the managers of any
event which could give rise to a claim, and Mr Chaplin says members cannot rely on their agent in a port to inform the local P&I correspondent. "We followed up on this case, and the owner's agent said he would not notify P&I correspondents unless expressly ordered to by the shipowner. He saw his duty as only to notify the owner, his principal, of the hospitalisation. The owner should have informed us, but didn't."
<P>

<BR>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Approved agreements</H3>

MEMBERS are taking risks if they don't keep aware of changes to employment
contracts, and get those contracts approved by the club, according to Ernie Chaplin. "We have found that some members are still not aware of the substantial increase in compensation benefits for death in service of Filipino seafarers which became payable in accordance with the POEA Standard Contract which took effect from March 19, 1994," says Mr Chaplin. "This puts up death benefits to $50,000 plus $7,000 for each child under 21. Members must take account of this, and have their crew employment contracts approved by the Club." 
<P>
Mr Chaplin also highlighted recent cases where crew agreements contained annuity clauses which would entitle an injured seafarer to a life annuity of 86 per cent of basic pay. The Club made clear in 1993 that it would not cover agreements carrying such a clause entered into after February 20, 1993. It is in the interests of all members to ensure that contracts and crew agreements are submitted to the Club for approval, as they will not be covered for liabilities under contracts not approved. 
<P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Calls"></A>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Conservative calls</H3>

THE London Club has been known as possibly the most conservative and cautious
of all the major group Clubs. That caution was reflected at the annual overseas committee meeting, held in Monte Carlo in mid-October. The committee agreed a general increase in calls of five percent for the 1997/8 policy year. That decision has to be ratified by the Finance & Audit Committee in December, and like all decisions made by such an active board as that of the London Club, it was not arrived at without strong debate.
<P>
Underpinning the decision to raise rates was the knowledge that this year we, and perhaps more so other clubs, have begun to see a rising trend in claims. Also, the committee is clearly aware of the continual increase in legal liabilities which shipowners are facing.
<P>
The committee urged the managers to play a leading role in negotiating a reduction in the International Group's reinsurance premium, and noted with satisfaction that shipowner opinion, and some other clubs, have now swung behind the realistically collectible limit on cover we advocate.
<P>
Despite the caution, the meeting, the first, but hopefully not the last, we have held in Monte Carlo, was characterised by a feeling that our Club is on the move, and growing stronger and more influential.
<P>

<H3>Stowaway warning</H3>

SHIP masters may be faced with a two year jail sentence if stowaways held on
board abscond in a Turkish port. Istanbul-based Omur Marine warns that the Turkish Marine Police are tightening procedures on stowaways, and applying the regulations rigorously.
<P>
According to Omur, the Turkish immigration law demands that masters declare the presence of stowaways on the vessel on arrival in a Turkish port. The stowaways must then be held on board and the master is responsible for their detention. If they abscond, the master will be brought before a criminal court and may be sentenced to two years' jail and a heavy fine.
<P>
If the master fails to declare the stowaways, and the Marine Police find out that they are on board, the master will face the same sentence as above, and in addition, the stowaway will get six months in jail.

<H3>Pollution monitoring</H3>

THE Malaysian government is to introduce a 24 hour surveillance, early warning and detection system for oil pollution in Malaysian waters. It will monitor both oil and illegal sludge dumping and discharge.
<P>
According to Singapore-based Spica Services, the system will be based on a sensor buoy system. Fixed buoys will be located in pollution hot spots. Sensors on the buoys will detect oil in the water and relay the information via satellite to a command centre.

<H3>Pass the parcel</H3>

ARRESTING vessels can be a tricky business, not least because ships are paid to keep on the move. And these days, the power of arrest is sometimes blatantly abused.
<P>
A sense of uniformity is needed, but nobody is holding their breath at the outcome of an IMO/UNCTAD meeting in Geneva later this year which is charged with updating - although, sadly, not shortening the name of - the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships 1952. In the meantime, things will doubtless go on pretty much as they have been for the past decade, which has been a boom period for arrests.
<P>
Most of these arrests use accepted methods, and recognised ways of finding out where the ships are going to be so that they can be arrested in a suitable jurisdiction. But there are other ways.
<P>
A ship's master recently received a telex at sea from a so-called parcel services company which said, "We have a package for you and missed you in Poland. Please advise your next port of call." Since he wasn't expecting a parcel, the master did a little detective work and found that the parcel services company's telex answerback was the same as that of a well-known claims recovery agent which acts for cargo underwriters in claims against shipowners, and which is not above seeking the arrest of ships to obtain security.
<P>
This ship had an aware master. But we would be failing in our duty if we didn't point out that there are times when shipping, like everybody else, should beware of suspect packages.
<P>

<H3>Peru brings in ballast rules</H3>

PERU's Maritime Authority has decreed that all vessels calling at Peruvian ports must renew their ballast completely while on the high seas, at least 12 miles from the Peruvian coast. Lima-based Overseas Service Agency warns members that the new rules apply to all Peruvian ports, including the Amazon port of Iquitos. All ships entering port will be checked to ensure that their deck and engine logs record the exact date, time, location and volume of ballast water pumped out and replaced by clean seawater.
<P>
If vessels cannot change their ballast water at sea, they have to treat the tanks with Sodium Hypochlorite. The rules make ship agents responsible for informing masters in time before arrival of the clean ballast requirements.

<A NAME="Seminars"></A>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Seminars</H3>

BILBROUGH is developing its programme of in-house seminars, and during October and November two well attended events were held. London law firm Ince & Co held a one day course on Emergency Response, covering legal implications, managing the media, oil pollution, co-ordination and communication. Canadian law firm Bull, Housser & Tupper, which has an office in Shanghai, sent its partner Clive Ansley to give a presentation to Bilbrough's staff on the current situation in China.
<P>
A Bilbrough & Co welcome suggestions for seminars and have a well appointed and flexible venue to hold them in at their Leman Street office. The seminars are normally for Bilbrough's staff, but members are welcome to attend. Queries and suggestions to Lance Johnson on +44 (0)171 772 8000.

<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

SOCIAL events at the Monte Carlo committee meeting in October included a dinner party at the Yacht Club given by Sammy Ofer. The trio of gypsy musicians inspired Frank Chao to sing Italian love songs.  The following night Bilbroughs hosted a dinner party in the ornate fin-de-siecle Salle Belle Epoque at the Hotel Hermitage. Members of the committee and their ladies were joined by a number of the Club's Italian members, brokers from Italy and the Club's Marseilles correspondent. Reports that some of the hosts tried out the famous Monte Carlo Casino are true, but as all are at their desks we can assume no-one made a fortune.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

AS the UK weather turns nasty and the days shorten, thoughts turn to traditional indoor competitions. London office staff held a darts match at the Scarborough Arms on October 29. Ergin, Wendy, Mike Berry, Pat Carter and Steve West were the winning team, followed by runners-up Paul Hinton, Moira, Jamie, Anna and Donna.
<P>

<BR>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
THE first person from Bilbroughs' Hong Kong office to get to the race track at the weekend is Cecilia Chan. She lists horse racing, gambling, mahjong, the Mark Six lottery and fishing as her hobbies. But Cecilia, who joined the office when it opened twenty years ago, does not take her work home. If she did, the petty cash would not balance, as it always has done, to the last cent. 
<P>
Another reason for not taking work home is that colleagues might have found it strange to meet her flatmate. For many years Cecilia kept a duck in her flat, and it lived to a ripe old age. She now has a dog, which she claims is very expensive to keep. But perhaps she has two homes, as she says one home is the Guardian House office, where she likes all the other staff and their families. "We socialise and go for meals together and there is a nice atmosphere," smiles Cecilia (right).<IMG SRC="images/lcn8_3.jpg" ALT="Cecilia Chan" WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=162 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM> "I've been here twenty years and I still like it."
<P>
Colleagues say that Cecilia can find a way to organise anything, which is just as well, because she has been office manager since 1988. Before that, she worked as a secretary for all the resident directors, developing her knowledge of P&I. "I knew nothing about insurance when I started," says Cecilia. "I found it confusing and a little dull." But Cecilia studied and began to understand the fascination of the cases and the negotiating at the heart of dealing with claims and members in a busy regional office. Members who call at the office have never found Cecilia dull. And if things get a little dull for her, she can always think of the weekends, when if she is
not at the races, you will find her out fishing. Who says P&I isn't a gamble?
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
The managers go from strength to strength in their eternal tussle with London's law firms. Two convincing wins by Bilbroughs' football team against Bentley, Stokes and Lowless, and against Jackson Parton, have convinced the captain at least that Wembley is the next step.
<P>
December marks the 20th Anniversary of the opening of the Hong Kong office of A Bilbrough & Co. There will be a reception for Far East members and
correspondents, and the famous noon-day gun will be fired to mark the occasion.
<P>
Judith Scammell has rejoined the company as a Senior Systems Analyst, having
previously worked with us from 1983 until 1987.
<P>
John Walker, IT Manager and Assistant Director, retired in November after twenty years' service in the IT department. Gary Durham takes over as manager of the IT department.

<BR><A NAME="chairman"><H3>CHAIRMAN'S REPORT</H3></A><BR>
<P>
At the Committee meeting in January 1996 I was elected to succeed
Russell Peters as Chairman of the Committee.  Having been a
Member of the Committee for 16 years  and Vice-Chairman for the
last four, I was honoured to accept this responsibility and
intend to provide active and energetic leadership to the London
Club in developing its business.
<P>
I wish to pay tribute to my predecessor, Russell Peters, who
provided excellent leadership as Chairman with great charm, tact
and diplomacy, during a period of steady recovery for the Club,
both in terms of financial strength and membership growth, over
the last four years.
<P>
Over the last year, the Club has made steady progress in terms of
financial strength and growth of membership and I am quite
confident that the Club is now in a position to capitalise on
this improvement by taking a larger market share of good quality
tonnage.
<P>
The balance sheet at 20th February 1996 shows assets totalling
US$372m, an increase of 5% on the previous year, and accumulated
reserves of US$81m, up from US$38m in the previous year, an
increase of 116%.  The Club has never been in a stronger
financial position.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Club is continuing to attract interest
as its growing financial strength gains recognition in the
market.  Moreover, the Club continues its very selective policy
towards new business; and the gradual improvement in the quality
of the entered tonnage over the last few years is well reflected
in the Club's favourable claims experience of recent years.  The
Club's tonnage continues to be dominated by vessels involved in
the bulk trades, with the average size of ship entered in the
Club being about 26,500 gt.  Furthermore, the Club has maintained
its reputation for good service to Members.
<P>
The Club has a reputation for having a very active Committee,
which plays a pivotal role in determining the Club's policy on
important general issues.  I feel that there is a healthy balance
in the relationship between Committee and Managers within the
Club.  The Committee respect the competence, commitment and
experience of the Club's Managers and give careful consideration
to all their recommendations but the Committee do not 'rubber
stamp' these recommendations.  Equally the Managers pay careful
attention to the Committee's views and are scrupulous in
executing their decisions.  The Committee regard it as their
proper role and responsibility carefully to examine all issues of
general importance and to consider all possible approaches,
before reaching its own decision.  As the Board of a mutual Club,
the Committee has proper regard for its duty and responsibility
towards the membership in reaching decisions on matters of
general policy which are in the best interests of the Members as
a whole.  In the Committee's view, it cannot abdicate from this
duty and responsibility or delegate it to the Managers.
<P>
It is for this reason that the Committee is sometimes perceived
to take a strong and independent line on matters of general
policy - such as the issue of limit on Club cover.  The Committee
was unanimous in rejecting the compromise proposal for limitation
on Club cover, by way of the introduction of a limit on Members'
liability for catastrophe or overspill Calls at 20% of their
entered ships' limits of liability for property damage under the
1976 Limitation Convention, on the ground that these limits,
aggregating US$20 billion for the total International Group
tonnage, were not realistically collectible; and do not protect
shipowners from the risk of financial ruin in the case of a
catastrophe.  Since that time, in April 1995, the Committee has
continued its campaign for a reduction in these limits to 2-3% of
ships' limits for property damage under the 1976 Convention,
producing an aggregate limit for the Group's tonnage of US$2-3
billion.  This would produce an overall limit on Club cover of
US$3.5 - 4.5 billion, once the Group's reinsurance contract is
taken into account.
<P>
For a long period, the proponents of the compromise proposal
identified the opposition as confined to one sector of the
shipping community.  However, it is now quite clear from the
decision reached by the Asian Shipowners' Forum at its meeting in
Hong Kong in May 1996 and from responses received from Members to
questionnaires on the subject sent by the United Kingdom, the
London, the Swedish, the Newcastle and the West of England Clubs
that the overwhelming majority of shipowners worldwide are in
favour of the limit being reduced to a realistically collectible
level.  At the moment, there is no clear agreement as to what is
a realistically collectible level, although the majority appear
to favour 2-3%.  I believe that the International Group will in
due course agree a significant reduction in the present limit;
and that the position taken by the London Club from April 1995
onwards will be fully vindicated.
<P>
Another matter of common concern to shipowners is the current
cost of the Group's reinsurance programme.  For the five Policy
Years up to 1995/96, this programme has cost the Group US$1.6
billion, whilst claims paid and outstanding total US$317m, a loss
ratio of 20%.  The Club will argue for a substantial reduction in
premium cost on the next renewal, whether involving substantial
increases in the Group's retention of risk or developing new
markets for the placement of this programme.
<P>
When the Committee elected me as Chairman, it also elected Peter
John Goulandris and Robert Alexander Ho as Vice-Chairmen.  Peter
John is Chairman of the International Tanker Owners Pollution
Federation and a leading and respected figure within the tanker
industry.  Robert has recently played a very active and
enthusiastic role within the insurance committees of the Hong
Kong Shipowners' Association and Asian Shipowners' Forum and has
done much to alert shipowners in the Far East to the implications
of the compromise limitation proposal.
<P>
Indeed, I was pleased to make a trip to the Far East in May 1996,
with Graham Edmiston and Lance Johnson of the Managers, visiting
Hong Kong at the time of the Intertanko and Asian Shipowners'
Forum meetings, and then to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.  I met
many of our Members and other prominent shipowners.  I was
impressed by the steady growth of shipping in that area and by
the very good reputation which the London Club enjoys in the Far
East, which its very active Hong Kong office under John Williams
has clearly helped to establish.  My trip to the Far East leads
me to hope that the Club will continue to develop its business in
that part of the world, notwithstanding the tough competition
between Clubs.
<P>
The last year has been a very active one for the Club, with the
move to Leman Street and the corporate restructuring in Bermuda;
and I wish to express my personal thanks and that of the
Committee to the Managers for their commitment and dedication to,
and energy and enthusiasm for, the affairs of the Club which have
given it fresh vigour.
<P>
I sincerely hope that this augurs well for the future and that my
period in office as Chairman of the Committee will coincide with
steady growth in the Club's size and importance.  I have no doubt
that the Club has all the basic ingredients for success amongst
the Committee, Members and the Managers, and that we can look
forward to the future with confidence.  I will certainly do all
that is within my power to see that the Club fulfils all of its
present promise.

<H3>Introduction</H3>

Since 1866, "The London Club" has enabled shipowners to protect themselves against the many legal liabilities to which they are exposed in the course of their business, and against which the ordinary policies on ship, freight, etc., afford no protection.
<P>
Since the London Club was founded, many additional liabilities have been imposed on shipowners, and the cover afforded by the Association has been progressively extended so as to give shipowners the protection which experience has shown to be most required. The terms of the present comprehensive insurance are contained in the Association's Rules, copies of which can be obtained from the Managers, (see <A HREF="contact.htm" onMouseOver="self.status='Contact info for the Managers and correspondents worldwide'; return true">Contacting the Club</A>) but the particulars given in this website's <A HREF="re_p_i.htm" onMouseOver="self.status='About the insurance cover offered by the London Club'; return true"> "About P&amp;I"</A> page will indicate the main features of the cover. 
<P>
<A HREF="#Committee" onMouseOver="self.status='The shipowners comprising the London Club Committee'; return true">The Committee,</A> which consists of shipowners, meets frequently, thus ensuring prompt attention to claims.
<P>
The Managers at <A HREF="re_abc.htm" onMouseOver="self.status='About A Bilbrough &amp; Co Ltd'; return true"> A Bilbrough &amp; Co Ltd</A> draw on a range of skills, with expertise in law, insurance, accountancy and seamanship. 
<P>
Further, the Association maintains correspondents at over 300 ports throughout the world who are available to assist Members and their Masters in case of need. An up-to-date list of <A HREF="contact.htm#Correspondents" onMouseOver="self.status='Contact details for correspondents, sorted geographically';return true">correspondents' contact details</A> is available on this site.

<H3>Management of the site</H3>

<H4>Compatibility</H4>
The site was created using the <a href="http://www.sausage.com"; onMouseOver="self.status='Sausage Software Home Page';return true"><IMG SRC="images/hotdog.gif" height=15 width=16 hspace=4 ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM  border=0><strong>Hot Dog Pro</strong></a> Web Page Editor, and Netscape <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com" onMouseOver="self.status='Netscape Home Page'; return true"><IMG SRC="images/navigatr.gif" height=15 width=16 hspace=4 ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM border=0><STRONG> Navigator</STRONG></A> browser software. It has been tested using Mac and Windows editions of Navigator versions 2.02 and 3 - the current <EM>de facto</EM> world standard browsers (Summer 1996). It may not appear at its best using another browser; if any features of the site fail to work (such as the animated <A HREF="#Top" onMouseOver="self.status='Let me have another look: I must have missed it before...'; return true">logo</A> at the top of this page, or the client-side image-<A HREF="contact.htm#Correspondents" onMouseOver="self.status='Select area from a world map, then select country'; return true">map</A> of the Association's Correspondents around the world), I would recommend switching to Netscape. 
<P>
Also, if you are using earlier versions of Netscape, it is worth upgrading. Version 2.02 for Windows seems more stable than version 2.01, and version 3 seems slicker and more capable still. New content added after 19 August 1996 will be enhanced for Navigator 3, which can be found at the touch of this button:<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com" onMouseOver="self.status='This recommendation does not create any legal relationship...'; return true"><IMG WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=31 SRC="images/netnow3.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER=0 HSPACE=4 VSPACE=0></A> 
<P>
At present I do not recommend Microsoft's Internet Explorer, versions of which have been remarkably slow and had difficulty with certain graphics, or have crashed when accessing the <A HREF="#Links">links</A> below. It may be that the final release of Internet Explorer version 3 fixes these problems.

The information in this site will be updated whenever suitable new material is ready for publication, but we shall remove anything which becomes out-of-date whether or not there is new material ready to replace it.

<P>
<H4>Financial Position</H4>
During 1995/96 the London Club's financial position continued to
strengthen significantly and the Balance Sheet as at 20th
February 1996 shows the strongest ever financial picture.  Assets
stood at US$371.778m, an increase of 4.8% on the previous year,
and accumulative reserves had more than doubled to US$81.481m
from US$37.689m a year earlier.  As noted below under
"Presentation of Financial Information" the statutory solvency
margin which the Club is required to meet by the United Kingdom
Department of Trade and Industry is covered 4.82 times, thus
providing a reasonably comfortable buffer.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Class 5 - Protecting & Indemnity</H4>
1992/93 Policy Year was formally closed by the Committee in 1995,
and its credit balance was transferred to the Closed Year fund. 
After taking account of movements in outstanding claims estimates
on previous closed Policy Years, the resulting balance on the
Closed Year fund of US$38.6m was then transferred to the Calls
Equalisation Account, in accordance with previous practice.  A
new US$50m Contingency Account has been established by a transfer
from the Calls Equalisation Account, leaving a balance of US$3.8m
on that account.
<P>
1993/94 Policy Year, which is scheduled to be closed formally by
the Committee in 1996, now shows a credit balance of US$18.4m. 
1994/95 Policy Year, in respect of which a 30% Supplementary Call
was levied in August 1995 (compared with the original estimate of
40%), now shows a small credit balance of US$1.5m.
<P>
1995/96 Policy Year shows a deficit of US$12m after taking credit
for the 30% Supplementary Call to be levied in August 1996
(again, compared with the original estimate of 40%).  However,
recent history suggests that this deficit is likely to shrink or
disappear, as the projection of Incurred But Not Reported claims
reduces, and additional investment income is allocated to the
year.
<P>
After adding in Unrealised Gains on investments of US$16.1m,
which are not allocated to Policy Years, the total balance for
the Class stands at US$77.8m, which compares with an equivalent
balance at 20th February 1995 of US$34.0m.
<P>
First indications show that claims costs in 1996/97 Policy Year
may be running higher than in the last few years, but at this
early stage of the year, give no undue cause for concern.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Class 8 - Freight, Demurrage and Defence</H4>
It was noted in the 1995 Managers' Review that the Class had
experienced a very substantial increase in costs in respect of
one claim, arising in the closed 1990/91 Policy Year, and the
reserve in respect of that claim has again increased during the
course of the 1995/96 financial year.  However, the credit
balance resulting from the closure of 1992/93 Policy Year led to
a transfer from the Closed Year fund of US$2.4m to the Calls
Equalisation Account, which now stands at US$5.1m.
<P>
Small deficits are shown in respect of each of the open Policy
Years, but it is anticipated that these deficits should reduce or
disappear as a result of a reduction in the IBNR element of the
outstanding claims estimates, and additional investment income. 
After taking account of Unrealised Gains on investments of
US$1.1m, the overall surplus of the Class stands at US$1.6m.
<P>
The Optimum Calling Philosophy which was adopted by the Committee
in 1990 for Class 5 - P&I, has led to early Supplementary Calls
being levied in respect of that Class.  However, the potential
volatility resulting from unexpected escalation in cost of the
occasional expensive claim incurred in Class 8 has persuaded the
Committee that the Optimum Calling Philosophy is not appropriate
for this Class.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Presentation of Financial Information</H4>
The Club prepared its Financial Statements as at 20th February
1994 and 1995 in a format which anticipated the requirements of
the EU Insurance Accounts Directive, passed into law in the
United Kingdom as the Companies Act 1985 (Insurance Company
Accounts) Regulations 1993; these Regulations are now mandatory
for British insurance companies.  Most Members will now be
familiar with the statutory format.  However, some additional
data has been included in the Financial Statements as at 20th
February 1996, providing a full and explicit picture of the
Club's financial position.
<P>
The following list summarises the principal enhancements.  The
Committee, and the Managers, would be pleased to consider any
ideas for further disclosure which Members, and other interested
parties, might care to submit.
<P>
<STRONG>1. Reinsurance Premiums: Contribution to other Associations' Pool Claims.</STRONG><BR>
The treatment of Pool claims has been somewhat inconsistent, as
paid Pool claims have been treated as reinsurance premiums,
whereas outstanding Pool claims have been treated as outstanding
claims.  The Club's contributions to all Pool claims, whether
paid or outstanding, are now shown as reinsurance premiums, and
1995 figures have been accordingly restated.
<P>
<STRONG>2. Outstanding Claims.</STRONG><BR>
For the best part of a decade, Consulting Actuaries have assessed
Incurred But Not Reported ("IBNR") uplifts to add to the
Managers' estimates in respect of the cost of notified claims. 
It makes sense for the IBNR element of the total outstanding
claims to be shown separately, and Note 16 - Technical Provisions
- Claims Outstanding provides a complete breakdown of the
constituent elements of the Technical Provisions shown  in the
Balance Sheet.
<P>
<STRONG>3. Debtors - Members.</STRONG><BR>
The amount written-off as bad debts is now shown, in addition to
disclosure of the Provision for Doubtful Debts.
<P>
<STRONG>4. DTI Return.</STRONG><BR>
The Club is required to submit an annual Return to the United
Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry ("DTI"), in a prescribed
format.  A copy of the full DTI Return is included for the first
time within the Financial Statements, for the convenience of
Members and other interested parties.
<P>
The statutory solvency margin which the Club is required to meet,
as at 20th February 1996, is US$18.156m.  The excess of available
net assets over the required minimum margin is US$69.275m, and
therefore the statutory solvency requirement is covered 4.82
times.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Corporate Restructuring</H4>
Over the last two or three years it has become increasingly
apparent that the corporate structure allowing the Club to
reinsure the majority of its risks with its subsidiary companies
was outmoded. 
<P>
The Committee wished to continue to take advantage of the Club's
location in the United Kingdom, bringing with it the benefit of
the ability to trade freely in Europe, and to be regulated
intelligently and sympathetically by the Department of Trade and
Industry.  UK tax legislation, however, was potentially
unfriendly to the parent-subsidiary relationship operating
between the Club and its wholly-owned reinsurer, London & Bermuda
Reinsurance Co. Ltd. ("London & Bermuda").
<P>
In January 1995 the Committee agreed to move towards a more
efficient structure.  After examining several ideas, the
Committee decided upon a parallel structure as being the most
appropriate arrangement whereby reinsurance would be effected
through a contract with a parallel mutual organisation, to be
owned by the Members of the Club.  By this means the Club could
remain British, but could also avoid the potential tax pitfalls
of a parent-subsidiary reinsurance arrangement. 
<P>
At the behest of the Members in 1978, a suitable mutual company,
The London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association
(Bermuda) Limited ("LSSO Bermuda") had been set up in Bermuda but
had never traded, and this company was therefore activated in
1995.  Its Board operates independently of the Club's Committee,
with only one common member, Mr. R.A. Peters who stood down as
the Chairman of the Club in January 1996, and immediately assumed
the Presidency of LSSO Bermuda.
<P>
From 20th February 1996 LSSO Bermuda has reinsured 90% of the
Club's P&I and FD&D risks.  Following arms-length negotiations
between London & Bermuda and LSSO Bermuda, the former company's
liabilities have been assumed by the latter company, the
consideration being the major part of London & Bermuda's assets. 
The remaining assets are expected to be repaid to the Club during
the course of 1996, by way of dividends, following which London &
Bermuda will be rendered dormant.
<P>
The present Board of LSSO Bermuda comprises:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Mr. R.A. Peters - President
<LI>Mr. N.B. Dill - Vice-President
<LI>Mr. C.T. Collis - Vice-President
<LI>Mr. D. Ezekiel - Vice-President and Managing Director
<LI>Dr. D. Saul
<LI>Mr. R. Rans
<LI>Mr. S. Tsitsopoulos
<LI>Mr. S. Kellner
<LI>Mr. E-O. Nedelmann
<LI>Ms. M. Coye is the Secretary.
</UL>
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Investments</H4>
A highly conservative investment policy was followed from the
third quarter of 1994 until  October 1995, with about half the
funds being held as cash.  In October 1995 two additional fixed
income fund managers were appointed by London & Bermuda,
respectively to manage a short term ultra-conservative US
Treasury portfolio, and an international top-quality bond
portfolio with currency hedging.
<P>
At 20th February 1996, therefore, London & Bermuda had three
fixed income portfolios amounting in total to US$207m and a
US$57m US Equity portfolio.  LSSO Bermuda agreed to continue to
use the same investment managers as London & Bermuda, but have
subsequently also appointed a fifth investment manager to manage
a global non-US equity portfolio, whilst the appointment of a
further equity manager is also anticipated.
<P>
Investment returns were much more satisfactory in 1995/96 than in
the previous year.  The total investment return, including
Unrealised Gains on investments, amounted to US$38.048m,
representing a return on the average total assets (including
debtors etc.) of 10.5%, and a return on invested funds of 13.2%.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Reinsurance</H4>
The Chairman has emphasised the London Club's concern about the
cost of the Group's reinsurance programme.  An initiative,
referred to as "Designated Reserves", was commenced in 1992, and
has now been fully implemented, to strengthen Clubs' ability to
rely upon each other financially so that, if necessary, pooling
could be very considerably expanded, thus reducing dependence
upon market reinsurance arrangements, during periods of adverse
market conditions.  At the time of writing, in July 1996, it does
appear likely, however, that very significant reductions in the
cost of reinsurance for 1997/98 should be achieved.
<P>
The Club continues to
benefit from its very worthwhile and beneficial relationship with
European reinsurers, who provide protection for claims within the
Club's retention, including protection against the Club's
contribution to its own Pool claims.  To date, no claims have
been made under these reinsurance arrangements which have now
been in place for three years.  The Group has taken 15% vertical
co-insurance of the first layer of the Group Excess Loss
Reinsurance Contract, and therefore limited additional cover has
been purchased for 1996/97 to protect against a string of very
large claims falling upon this co-insurance layer.

<H4>Membership</H4>
The Club's directly entered tonnage continued to grow during
1995/96 and at 19th February 1996 stood at 26.97m gt - an
increase during the year of 1.18m gt.  The majority of this
increase resulted from new purchases by existing Members and the
Club continues its very selective policy towards new business;
and continues to concentrate on vessels involved in bulk trades,
with the average size of ship entered in the Club being about
26,500 gt.
<P>
On renewal at 20th February 1996, the Club suffered the
disappointment of losing one major fleet and this was the
principal reason for a reduction in the Club's directly entered
tonnage on renewal to 25.26m gt.  Since 20th February 1996, the
tonnage has increased to 25.67m gt.
<P>
Notwithstanding the loss of a major fleet on renewal, and the
consequent reduction in entered tonnage, the general trend in the
Club's business remains upward and positive, with the Club
continuing to attract interest, and business, from leading
shipowners.  The Club's improving reputation has enabled it to
pursue a rigorous attitude towards both existing and new
business.  The Club has declined to renew entries, where the
Member's performance has proved unsatisfactory, in terms of ship
condition and maintenance and in payment of premium, and the Club
adopts restrictive criteria in the acceptance of new business,
declining to quote on much of the business which it is offered. 
Although this restrictive policy militates against a rapid
expansion in the Club's tonnage, it is also the main reason for
the Club's improved claims experience in recent years.  The Club
presently enjoys the best Pool claims record of any Group Club.

<H4>Limit on Club Cover</H4>
At a specially convened meeting in London on 10th November 1995,
the Committee decided to follow the lead taken by the
Boards/Committees of ten out of the thirteen International Group
Clubs in agreeing to implement the compromise proposal for the
introduction of a limit on a Member's liability for a catastrophe
or overspill claim at 20% of his entered ships' limits of
liability for property damage under the 1976 Limitation
Convention, with effect from 20th February 1996.  If the
Committee had continued to reject the compromise proposal, the
London Club would have been excluded from the International
Group's Pooling Agreement.  At the same time, the Committee
determined to continue its efforts to promote awareness amongst
shipowners and their associations of the implications of the
compromise proposal and to continue to press for the introduction
of a limit on Club cover for all claims at a realistically
collectible level.
<P>
In January 1996, the Committee heard that responses to a
questionnaire sent by the UK Club to its Members indicated
overwhelming support for its Board's longer term strategy of
seeking to achieve a limit on cover at a realistically
collectible level.  Furthermore, in May 1996 the Asian
Shipowners' Forum also decided that the limit on Club cover had
to be reduced to a realistically collectible level and that the
constituent associations comprising the ASF would encourage their
shipowning Members to lobby their Clubs for a reduction in the
current limit.
<P>
In April 1996 the London Club sent a questionnaire to its
Members, and Members representing 72% of the Club's directly
entered tonnage have replied.  Of those replies, 90% are in
favour of ship's limits for overspill calls being reduced to 2-3%
of ships' Convention limits and 4% would like to see the
percentage reduced to 1%.  The polls recently sent to Members by
the Swedish, Newcastle and West of England Clubs have produced a
similar response from a broad geographical spectrum of their
Members.
<P>
It is quite clear from the position now taken by the Asian
Shipowners' Forum and from the responses to recent Club
questionnaires that opposition to the very high limit introduced
by the compromise proposal is broadly based and is spreading
amongst shipowners around the world.
<P>
The Committee is therefore confident that, in due course, sanity
will prevail and that the Group will agree on a reduction in the
limit on Club cover to a level which is realistically
collectible.  Moreover, the position adopted by the Committee at
the start of this debate, when the compromise proposal was first
circulated in April 1995, appears to have been vindicated by
later events and to be supported by a majority of the world's
shipowners.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Oil Pollution</H4>
According to figures from the International Tanker Owners
Pollution Federation (ITOPF) the world tanker industry spilled
the least amount of oil in 1995 (5,000 tons) than in any other
year since the ITOPF started keeping records 25 years ago.  
However, two spills are likely to prove costly, since they
occurred in the same area of South Korea where there is extensive
fish and seaweed farming, and were from Korean tankers in the
same Hoyu Tankers fleet, entered in the UK Club.
<P>
Although the "SEA PRINCE" only spilled 700 tons of bunker fuel,
pollution claims approaching US$300m have arisen, which greatly
exceed the limit of US$87m available under Civil Liability
Convention (CLC) and the International Oil Pollution Compensation
Fund (IOPCF).  The "HONAM SAPPHIRE" spilled about 1,000 tons of
crude but claims arising are expected to stay within the CLC
limit of US$20m.
<P>
In February 1996, the "SEA EMPRESS" spilled 75,000 tons of crude
off Milford Haven in the UK.  The oil affected some 100
kilometres of coastline, consisting of sandy beaches and cliffs,
much of it part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, a
nature reserve, and although the clean-up was conducted quickly
and efficiently, substantial claims are expected for damage to
the environment and also from the local fishing and tourist
industries which are likely to be seriously affected.  Claims are
presently estimated at between US$50m and US$72m.
<P>
For much of the last twelve months shipowners and the
International Group have lived in the hope that pressure from the
shipping industry in Washington would lead to legislative changes
to OPA 90 resulting in some alleviation of the burden placed on
shipowners in obtaining Certificates of Financial Responsibility
(COFRs) for US trading.  However, the industry is now resigned to
the fact that no legislative changes to OPA 90 will take place
during the present US Congress and for at least some time after
the Presidential election in November 1996.  Indeed the Group has
been advised by its Washington counsel that no relaxation of the
COFR requirements will take place without the agreement of the
environmentalists, who are a powerful political lobby.
<P>
At a recent Congressional oversight hearing on OPA 90 COFR
regulations, a US shipowner testified that his firm had sustained
major losses in 1995 due to the cost of compliance with COFR
requirements and that shipowners are now divided between
'winners', who are sufficiently substantial to self-insure and do
not have to pay additional premium costs and 'losers', who cannot
self-insure and must assume the 'enormous expense' of purchasing
COFRs from one of the COFR guarantor insurance schemes available,
First Line or Shoreline.  The annual premium cost to shipowners
of obtaining COFRs through these schemes has been estimated at
US$60 - US$70m; and these charges cannot be included in
Worldscale and therefore, as a matter of course, passed on to
Charterers.  At the recent oversight hearing, an industry
spokesman asserted that the COFR requirement 'provides no added
value to the US consumer, or the US public' and 'simply provides
nothing more than a piece of paper, a ticket to trade to the US,
[with] no additional protection and no additional cover'. 
Shipowners have talked of the desirability of developing a
shipowner - or Club - sponsored COFR scheme, but to date none has
materialised.
<P>
In January 1996 the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) issued its Final Rule on the use of Natural
Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) by OPA 90 - designated trustees
(federal, state, American Indian tribal, and foreign officials)
against responsible parties involved in oil spills under OPA 90,
and these regulations subsequently came into effect.
<P>
Unfortunately, the NOAA has taken very little notice of strong
and well argued criticism of their previous proposals by the
International Group and other industry groups; and the most
objectionable features of earlier drafts have been retained.  The
Rule gives the trustees the power to use a considerable variety
of different methods to assess environmental damage, including
Contingent Valuation Methodology (CVM) to determine non-use or
passive use values, the use of simplified assessment procedures,
including unproven computer models and compensation formulae and
the power to use recoveries to fund chosen regional restoration
projects.
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed an appeal with
the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington seeking judicial
review of the final regulations and the International Group and a
number of industry groups have intervened in support of this
action.
<P>
On 30th May 1996 important changes took place in the law
governing compensation for pollution in most major maritime
states - apart from the USA - with the entry into force of the
1992 Protocols to the Civil Liability Convention (CLC) and the
Fund Convention 1971.
<P>
The main change is an increase in compensation from the previous
limit of 60m SDRs (about US$87m) to a new maximum of 135m SDRs
(about US$200m).  As before, the first tier of compensation is
paid for by the shipowner and his Club under CLC - the limit
being based on a sliding scale according to the tonnage of the
ship concerned up to a maximum of 60m SDRs (about US$87m) - and,
in larger cases - the second tier is available from the
International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF).  The
shipowners' proportion is significantly increased; but the
Protocols have been strongly supported by the shipping and
insurance industries as they maintain the viability of a system
which has worked very well in practice over the years, to the
advantage of claimants and industry alike.
<P>
One improvement introduced by the 1992 Protocols is to limit
claims for damage to the environment to the cost of reasonable
measures of reinstatement actually incurred or to be incurred. 
The need for this restriction became apparent from the "HAVEN"
case (146,000 tons spilt in Italy in 1991) in which the Italian
Government presented a claim for environmental damage of US$362m
without any evidence in support.  Claims of this nature have the
effect of prejudicing the interests of genuine victims of the
spill such as fishermen, hoteliers and others with undoubted
claims for loss of income, since they threaten a situation in
which all claimants must accept reduced settlements.
<P>
The tendency for Governments or national agencies to pursue
speculative claims for alleged economic loss and non-economic
loss against the IOPCF has protracted the resolution of claims
arising from a number of major spills in recent years, including
the "HAVEN", the "AEGEAN SEA" (80,000 tons spilt in Spain in
1992) and the "BRAER" (84,000 tons spilt in the Shetlands, UK, in
1993).  Claims for damage to the environment are invariably based
upon the premise imported from the USA and enshrined in the
concept of NRDA that even a single spill causes permanent damage
to the environment.  However, there is very little scientific
evidence that spills have significant adverse long term effects
on the environment, provided they are properly and  promptly
cleaned up.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Hazardous and Noxious Substances</H4>
A recent IMO diplomatic conference held in London in April/May
1996 resulted in agreement on a new International Convention on
Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the
Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) by Sea and
also of a Protocol to the 1976 International Convention on
Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC Convention)
which increased shipowners' limits of liability for personal
injury and property damage by 235%.
<P>
The HNS Convention and the 1976 Limitation Convention were
considered by the conference together since the International
Group and International Union of Marine Insurers ( IUMI) had
consistently maintained that unless there was 'linkage' between
the two Conventions, that is, unless HNS claims were initially
dealt with in the general limitation fund constituted under the
Limitation Convention, with the HNS Convention providing a
supplementary fund in respect of HNS claims, the capacity of the
insurance market would be greatly reduced.
<P>
In the event, it was not possible to achieve linkage of the HNS
Convention with earlier  general limitation Conventions since
linkage could have created gaps in claimants' compensation.  This
would have arisen if a shipowner had been able to limit his
liability under a general limitation regime at a lower level than
his liability limits under the new HNS Convention.  Such a
situation would have arisen if the ship concerned was registered
in a state which had not adopted the HNS Convention but caused
damage in a state which had done so, and where both states were
party to the same general limitation regime.
<P>
The HNS Convention introduced two tiers of compensation, the
first being strict liability and compulsory insurance for
shipowners with a sliding scale limit based on the ship's tonnage
with a minimum liability of 10m SDRs (US$15m) for ships up to
2,000 gt and a maximum liability of 100m SDRs (US$150m) for ships
of 100,000 gt and over.  The second tier of liability consists of
an International HNS Fund, to be funded from levies on HNS
receivers in contracting states, with a limit of 250m SDRs
(US$375m).
<P>
The International Group argued that the substantial increase in
the limits under the 1976 Limitation Convention was not justified
once linkage was abandoned.  Their arguments were ignored.
<P>
The high levels of limitation introduced by the HNS Convention
and the Protocol are a disappointment to many shipowners but the
Group has acknowledged that the HNS Convention maintains
international uniformity of maritime law and recognises the
principle of shipowners' rights to limit liability and the
principle of liability sharing between shipowning and cargo
interests.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Salvage</H4>
The International Convention on Salvage came into force on 14th
July 1996, having been adopted in April 1989 to replace the 1910
Brussels Convention.
<P>
The new Convention combines the traditional 'no cure no pay'
principle, under which a salvor is only rewarded for his services
if the operation is successful, with a provision under Article 14
for enhancement of the salvage award to take account of the
salvor's skill and efforts in preventing or minimising damage to
the environment and also for Special Compensation to be paid to
salvors who have failed to earn a reward in the normal way by
recovery of property.  The compensation allowed consists of the
salvor's actual expenses, plus an uplift, which will not normally
be more than 30% of these expenses - but in exceptional
circumstances may be up to 100%, if environmental damage has been
minimised or prevented - and fair rates for his own men and
equipment.  These so-called 'safety net' provisions under Article
14 have been incorporated into the latest versions of Lloyd's
Open Form of Salvage Agreement, most recently LOF 95.  Special 
Compensation claims under Article 14 are covered by the P&I Clubs
and a Code of Practice has now been agreed between the
International Salvage Union and the International Group for
cooperation between the salvor and the P&I Club when salvage
services involve pollution prevention and a claim for Special
Compensation.
<P>
Nevertheless there is concern on both sides as to how Article 14
is operating in practice and is being applied by salvage
arbitrators and by the Courts, with salvors taking the view that
they are receiving inadequate compensation whilst the Clubs take
the view that they have no proper control over services being
performed for their account and indeed that the Salvage
Convention and LOF 95 do not represent satisfactory means of
determining salvage liability.  At the same time there are clear
signs of crisis in the salvage industry.
<P>
With these considerations in mind, the International Group
recently determined to investigate, in consultation with
shipowners, underwriters and salvors, whether an alternative
contractual arrangement to LOF could be developed with salvors.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>The ISM Code</H4>
For the majority of vessels the certification process under the
International Shipmanagement (ISM) Code is scheduled for
completion by the end of July 1998.  It appears that there are a
considerable number of Owners and vessels which have yet to
commence the process of compliance with the Code and doubts have
been raised as to whether the task can be completed within the
time available.  Some major trading nations have indicated that,
so far as they are concerned, there will be no extension to the
time limit and vessels without the requisite ISM certification
will not be allowed in their jurisdictions after July 1998.
<P>
Shipowners' compliance with the ISM Code could have effects not
originally contemplated by those drafting the legislation.  The
Code requires senior levels of management to be fully involved in
all safety and operational matters and a designated person or
persons, with access to the highest level of management, who is
responsible for monitoring the safety and pollution prevention
aspects of each vessel's operation.  This means that if claims
for damage or injury arise from casualties or accidents due to
breaches or failures in shipmanagement safety systems or
procedures, it will be more difficult for the shipowner to invoke
the defence that he exercised due diligence to make the ship in
all respects seaworthy prior and at the commencement of the
voyage.
<P><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=3><BR>
<H4>Class 8 - Freight Demurrage & Defence</H4>
In the 1995/96 Policy Year, 783 ships were entered for Freight
Demurrage & Defence cover, which number compares with 729 in
1994/95 and 689 in 1993/94.  However, in contrast to this steady
increase in entered ships, the number of new disputes notified to
the Managers during these policy years has slightly reduced, 669
new cases being notified in 1993/94, 666 in 1994/95, and 570 in
1995/96.
<P>
However, the total amounts paid against these years, namely
US$3,788,151 in 1993/94, US$3,309,884 in 1994/95, and
US$4,420,714 in 1995/96, suggests that, while the timing of the
payment of legal costs in any particular dispute will always be
somewhat fortuitous, there has been an increasing cost in going
to law and, hence, a continuing need for the Managers to exercise
vigilance in the supervision of disputes.
<P>
The reduction in the number of disputes being referred to the
Managers for handling is possibly a consequence of Members'
ability to resolve potential disputes in their infancy, and
perhaps also reflects an increasing dissatisfaction in the
shipping community at large with the cost, in terms of both money
and time, of legal proceedings.  This attitude is reflected in
the Managers' policy of handling as many FD&D cases in-house as
is consistent with achieving the best results for Members, and,
when instructing lawyers to handle the more complex disputes,
ensuring that the cases are run on an efficient and cost-effective basis.  In this respect, there is evidence of an
increasing tendency amongst lawyers in general, and London
solicitors in particular, to be more competitive over their legal
charges and this will hopefully contribute in time to a
moderation in the cost of litigation.
<P>
A deeper analysis of Freight Demurrage & Defence costs in the
1995/96 Policy Year also reveals the fact that, as between
London, New York, and other jurisdictions, London is by far and
away the preferred jurisdiction, with London lawyers, in
consequence, benefiting to the exclusion of their brethren
elsewhere.  Of the total costs paid to lawyers (as distinct from
non-legal correspondents, surveyors, consultants, experts and
arbitrators) in 1995/96, US$2,419,103 was paid to UK lawyers,
while US$521,276 was paid to US lawyers and US$790,260 to lawyers
in other jurisdictions. 
<P>
The more substantial litigation or arbitration will inevitably
produce the heaviest legal costs and this is illustrated by the
fact that five major cases accounted for 26%, or US$1,153,569, of
the costs paid in the 1995/96 Policy Year.  The nature of cases
giving rise to these costs were an unlawful arrest in Algeria, a
total loss involving an indemnity action against charterers, a
claim against loss of hire underwriters, a general charterparty
dispute, and a drydocking dispute.
<P>
The continuing popularity of London jurisdiction for the
resolution of disputes, and more especially London Arbitration,
is demonstrated by the fact that, of the 33 cases referred to the
Association's Committee for support in 1995/96, 23 involved
London Arbitration proceedings and 4 involved English High Court
proceedings.  As is perhaps traditional and predictable, some 30%
of these cases involved disputes over the non-payment of hire or
off-hire, while 20% of the cases involved claims for demurrage.
<P>
Consistent with the Managers' objectives of handling Freight
Demurrage & Defence disputes in-house and of striving to provide
Members with the service which they demand, namely careful and
timely advice, the Managers have recruited three young lawyers
over the last year to join the other ten lawyers within the
Managers' London, Piraeus and Hong Kong offices. It may be of
interest to note that their legal qualifications have been earned
in England, Louisiana and South Africa.

<FONT SIZE=+2></FONT>IT may not be the biggest P&amp;I club in existence, but the medium-sized London Club has established a singular reputation for taking a markedly independent line on matters which it regards as issues of fundamental principle.
<P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   Last year at the time of its annual report it was taking an uncompromising stance on the limit of club cover.
<P>
   With some markedly strong-minded members from Greece and the Far East and a management which likes to take account of their views, it perhaps was not surprising that the London Club's committee was unanimous in rejecting the compromise proposal put forward to International Group members.
<P>
   It was, pointed out the London Club committee, "not realistically collectable", with the limits providing owners with little real protection from the risk of financial ruin in the case of a catastrophe.
<P>
    A year has passed and this year's annual report notes that the London Club still fights its corner on this important issue, continuing its campaign for a reduction in these limits to 2%-3% of ships' limits for property damage under the 1976 Convention.
<P>
   And, according to chairman J M Lyras, it would appear that this unequivocal line is at long last gaining more general support.
<P>
   Certainly, a strong message of impatience at the status quo comes from the Far East, where the recent Asian Shipowners' Forum found strong support circulating for a limit reduction.
<P></MULTICOL><CENTER>...</CENTER><P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   A similarly strong line is being taken by the club on the current cost of the International Group's reinsurance programme, with the London members, described as "restless" on this point, arguing for a "substantial reduction" on premium cost at the next renewal.
<P>
   The club is arguing from a position of some financial strength, having more than doubled its reserves last year. One suspects that its tough-minded members will be unlikely to favour much compromise in this direction.
<P>
   It is a message that the insurance world needs to take on board. For some years now, after <EM>Exxon Valdez</EM> and the anticipation of US horrors, there has been the suggestion that marine insurance is predicated upon catastrophe.
<P>
   Luck has a lot to do with it, but there is another side to the story; one in which the incidence of major maritime loss has been inexorably reduced. Last year saw the smallest amount of marine losses ever, and the quantity of pollution reduced to unprecedented levels.
<P>
   It is time, argue the strong-minded shipowning members of mutuals, that reinsurers recognised reality.

<H3>P&amp;I clubs seek huge reinsurance cost cuts</H3></FONT>

<BR>
<EM>By Liz Shuker</EM><P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> MASSIVE cut in the cost of shipowners' liability reinsurance will be sought by the world's leading protection and indemnity clubs next year.
<P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   The 16 major P&amp;I clubs, which together insure more than 90% of the shipping fleet, will be looking to cut up to a third off the price of the International Group reinsurance contract when terms are renegotiated in February.
<P>
  The clubs have threatened to reduce their reliance on commercial reinsurance if underwriters cannot meet their pricing requirements.
<P>
   "Shipowners will not tolerate the huge amount of money going out of the industry. It is unjustified and there must be change," said Bryan Gaze, deputy chairman of the London P&amp;I club.
<P>
   Mr Gaze, who is a member of the International Group reinsurance sub-committee, expressed his personal view that the programme should cost "in the order of $200m".
<P>
   Shipowners paid $330m for their reinsurance cover this year.
<P>
   Although clubs enjoyed a good, solid relationship with their principal insurers, they "had paid too much" in the past, Mr Gaze said.
<P>
   The contract - the largest reinsurance policy in the world - covers shipowners for liability claims falling between $30m and $1.53bn, and is largely underwritten in London.
<P>
   About 80% of the risk is placed in the Lloyd's market, with additional participation from the London companies market, and Bermuda-based reinsurers such as Ace and XL.
<P>
   While softness in worldwide reinsurance markets resulted in a $58m reduction in the price of the contract this year, there remains concern that it is overpriced in relation to the clubs' loss record.
<P>
   Shipowners have paid $1.6bn for the policy in the five years preceding February 1996.</MULTICOL><P><HR WIDTH=5% ALIGN=center SIZE=1><P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   By contrast, reinsurers have paid out just $317m in claims, producing an abnormally low loss ratio of 20%.
<P>
   The clubs believe this warrants a major price reduction, and according to Mr Gaze, they will resort to more self-insurance if the terms offered by reinsurers next year are not acceptable.
<P>
   The clubs fired a warning shot to this effect earlier in the year by increasing their participation in the first, and most exposed, layer of the reinsurance contract from 10% to 15%.
<P>
   The move was described by one club as "a message to the market that self-insurance can be preferable to the price of reinsurance".
<P>
  Financial trusts established in Bermuda this year will also guarantee clubs' commitment to high-level losses, permitting them to self-insure with more confidence.
<P>
  Meanwhile, large reductions in the cost of reinsurance would benefit the overwhelming majority of the world's shipowners, who have seen the cost of their P&amp;I insurance escalate in recent years.
<P>
   The extent of the discount received by owners entered in the International Group clubs will depend on members' individual loss records and ship type, although it is likely most shipowners would receive substantial reductions in premium.

<H3>Like-minded</H3></FONT>

<BR>
<MULTICOL COLS=2>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A </FONT> CLUB, be it a sporting institution or an association of philosophic thought, is an institution of the like-minded. It functions best because of this unanimity of purpose and it is sensible that those who dissent seek solace elsewhere. P&I clubs are little different in this respect and although the historical mutuality might be tempered by the use of claims pooling, the best club is one in which the members are encouraged to set the same course and are more effective for this unity of purpose.
<P>
   It is interesting to see the common features exhibited by the membership of the London P&I Club, despite their considerable geographical diversity. They are members of a medium-sized club, but operate mostly big ships. They tend to be specialists in bulk shipping, in both dry and wet trades. And they have a substantial membership in both Greece and the Far East; a membership which tends to express itself forcefully on matters of 'mutual' interest.
<P>
   The London, according to its chairman John M. Lyras, likes to think of itself as a 'conservative' club with a traditional view of mutual insurance and indeed the operation of ships. 
<P>
   There is a high proportion of very serious shipowners who run family fleets, and their values clearly communicate themselves to other members. It is significant to see the common ground that is increasingly held between the members from the Far East,  who number some very big players with modern and growing fleets, and those from the older shipping families of Greece.
<P>
    It is significant that the growing impatience of the Asian shipowners with the northern Europeans does not seem to communicate itself to the Greeks. And that is crucial, too, because the increasing participation of the Asians in such associations must be encouraged at all levels. Asia needs to be properly represented in terms of the tonnage that is owned in this region. This is, after all, where the growth is to be found.
<P></MULTICOL><CENTER>...</CENTER><MULTICOL COLS=2><P>
   The alternative, of some sort of global divide with Asian owners developing their own institutions to duplicate those of the West must be considered wasteful, and a very real risk. The institutions of Europe need to be very mindful of the risks of such a geographic schism. 
<P>
   If Europe gets it wrong, the shipping world could find itself hopelessly divided, with Asian representative institutions, Asian insurance systems, Asian opinion hardening against 'old-fashioned' European maritime ideas. Any institution that brings the like-minded of these important regions together must be unreservedly welcomed, and the efforts of the London Club in this respect are to be commended.
<P>
     Any club, it has been said, must have a strict policy on new membership, lest its aims and objectives be diluted, and it is notable that that the London Club has "declined to quote on much new business". 
<P>
   Market share becomes second to shared values and possibly this is important too. P&I underwriting is a singular branch of insurance, but it is forcibly brought home, in times when the hull market appears to be softening fast, that it is the quality of the clientele that is invariably more important than the number of ships entered or even the spread of risk. 
<P>
   A restrictive policy on membership is nothing to despise, if the end product is a smaller group of people that can be comfortable with each other and agree upon their collective policies on important issues. The markedly independent line taken by the London on issues like club cover limits last year, and its current campaign on reinsurance costs is indicative of the sort of confidence which is produced by like minds.

<H3>International Group seeks reductions of $100m in reinsurance costs</H3></FONT>

By Claire Wilkinson
<P>
<EM>Call for P&amp;I premium cut is played down</EM>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A </FONT>N attempt by the International Group of P&amp;I clubs to secure reductions of at least $100m in their reinsurance costs was yesterday played down in the Lloyd's market.
<P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
"P&amp;I clubs are always trying to keep reinsurance costs down to a minimum. This is nothing new," said a leading Lloyd's underwriter heavily involved in the programme who preferred to remain anonymous.
<P>
    Members of the International Group of P&amp;I clubs, comprising 16 clubs, paid out around $330m in reinsurance costs last year and some believe this could be reduced by more than $100m next year.
<P>
    However, a leading Lloyd's underwriter said the P&amp;I clubs were posturing and that calls for reductions were unlikely to affect rates next year.
<P>
   "This is a specialised area which has undergone a few years of beneficial loss experience and rates have reacted favourably and probably will do so some more. However, we are a long way from February 20 (the renewal date) and there is plenty of time for major casualties between now and then," said the underwriter.
<P>
   "Obviously market forces will affect rates but not individual statements by clubs about what they expect. I do not anticipate dramatic reductions in rates to follow," he added.
<P>
   The issue was brought to the fore yesterday as the London P&amp;I club expressed concern about the cost of the International Group's reinsurance programme in its 1995-1996 annual report.
<P>
   "For the five policy years up to 1995/96, this programme has cost the group $1.6bn, while claims paid and outstanding total $317m, a loss ratio of 20%. The club will argue for a substantial reduction in premium costs on the next renewal," said London Club chairman John Lyras.
<P></MULTICOL><CENTER>...</CENTER><P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   An initiative begun in 1992, known as Designated Reserves, had been fully implemented to strengthen clubs' ability to rely upon each other financially.
<P>
   The initiative allows for considerable expansion of pooling, reducing the clubs' dependence on market reinsurance arrangements, during periods of adverse market conditions.
<P>
   "At the time of writing, in July 1996, it does appear likely, however, that very significant reductions in the cost of reinsurance for 1997/98 should be achieved," the club's report said.
<P>
   Michael Hill, underwriting director at the London Club, added: "The fact that clubs do have designated reserves whereby we are in a better position to take a larger part of the risk ourselves, means we will take more of the risk if we cannot get the right premium."
<P>
   He confirmed that members of the International Group had already increased their level of self-insurance to 15% in 1996, up from 10% in 1995.
<P>
   According to its annual report, the London Club now has total assets of $372m and an accumulated reserve of $81m, up from $38m last year. Investment return for the year was 13.2%.

<EM>London Club says that Far East owners will be the key to drive to reduce limit on clubs' exposure</EM></FONT>

<H4>Cosco adds its weight to the cover cap lobby</H4>
<MULTICOL COLS=2>
<FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>RESSURE from Asian shipowning giants such as the China Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco) will be a decisive factor in reducing the limit on P&amp;I cover, claims the London P&amp;I Club.
<P>
The club believes the industry will be unable to ignore the strength of feeling in favour of a lower cap in the Far East, given that the influence of the region's shipowners will stretch into the next century.
<P>
   Details of the club's recent survey on the issue showed 34% of replies were from the Far East. A further 45% were from Greek members, and 20% from Europe and the Near East.
<P>
   Cosco, one of the largest shipowners in the world, has opted to support a $2bn cap on overspill after considering the potential exposure of the various options.
<P>
   Funding a claim of $3.5bn, shipowners' maximum exposure under the limit suggested by Cosco would require club members to pay an overspill call roughly equal to 100% of their supplementary, considered by Cosco to be a manageable figure.
<P>
   Although the owner has the largest vessel entries in the UK, West of England and London clubs - avid supporters of a low limit - it also has tonnage entered in the Steamship Mutual which has yet to come out for or against a reduction in the limit.
<P>
   The size of the company and growth projections means it wields considerable clout within the P&amp;I industry.</MULTICOL><P><CENTER>...</CENTER><P><MULTICOL COLS=2>
   "The Asian owners took a bit longer to analyse the situation, but once they did, they reached the same conclusion as shipowners in other areas - that the limit must be brought down," said John Lyras of the London Club.
<P>
"Statements such as that made by Cosco cannot be ignored."
<P>                                                     
The club believes the limit can realistically be reduced in time for the 1998 renewal.
<P>
It was sceptical about increasing the clubs' reinsurance cover to meet a lower limit - quite apart from the cost implications for the clubs.
<P>
   Although it is possible that current reinsurance capacity could support a $3.5bn-worth of cover, thereby eliminating overspill calls under a 2% limit, there would be significant concerns over reinsurers' ability to honour such high cover, said the club, particularly if there were more than one claim in any year.
<P>
   Security had always to be borne in mind when buying reinsurance protection, said Bryan Gaze, the club's deputy chairman.
</MULTICOL><P><CENTER>...</CENTER><P>
<MULTICOL COLS=2>
   Announcing its results for 1995/96 yesterday, the club said it was now enjoying the strongest financial health ever.
<P>
   Club assets are up from $285m three years ago to $372m, while reserves have been increased by $43.79m to $81.48m - described as a "comfortable rather than excessive" cushion.
<P>
   Much improved investment returns, as enjoyed by all clubs last year, contributed $38m to the overall result, against just $400,000 in the previous year.
<P>
   Greater selectivity by the managers has also contributed to another year of moderate claims, and the club recorded the best pool record of the International Group clubs during 1995/96.
<P>
   More tonnage was rejected than accepted by the club during the year, leading to an improvement in the average age of its members, which now stands at 16.5 years, against the worldwide average of 18 years.
<P>
   Average size of members also leapt to 26,500 gt, or 40,000 dwt, by far the highest in the group, and in line with the club's philosophy to focus on bulkers and tankers.
<P>
   The club believes recent efforts by classification societies and governmental bodies to remedy the historically poor safety record of bulkers makes them one of the most highly regulated ship types, a factor which could have a beneficial effect on the club's overall claims record.
<P>
   The club believes it is now poised to take over a larger share of the P&amp;I pie, and could become a large, medium-size club in future.

<A NAME="Claims"><H3>Proactive approach reduces claim costs</H3></A>
THE refocusing of the London Club's business on more substantial owners operating larger vessels has reduced both the cost and volume of claims. It has also had a significant effect on the way in which larger P&amp;I claims are handled. 
<P>
The reduction in the numbers of smaller claims has enabled the club's managers to concentrate their own resources and to become much more proactive and aggressive when helping members deal with individual cases, particularly the larger ones. 
<P>
The managers had been concerned for some time that the traditional approach of reacting to events was depriving members of the opportunity to defend claims in the most effective manner. 
<P>
The refocusing of resources and the adoption of a new proactive approach involves making a commitment, at the outset, to collecting information about the cause of a casualty and establishing the issues which would determine the outcome of the claim. 
<P>
A strong investigating team is formed with the objective of painting as complete a picture as possible within a short time. In this way, it is possible for the member and the club to establish an aggressive claims handling strategy, with a degree of certainty that there will be no unpleasant surprises later to throw the plan off course.
<P>
There is now emerging a pattern of claims development, over the club as a whole, which indicates that the new approach is reaping rewards.
<P>
The graph reproduced below shows typical policy years in terms of reported claims developments for the 1980s and the 1990s. When compared, it will be noted that the shape of the two developments is quite different.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/lcn7_1.gif" ALT="Typical claims development" WIDTH=398 HEIGHT=277 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 ALIGN=middle></CENTER>
<P>
Whereas during the 1980s it took four years from the beginning of each policy year before sufficient information was available to enable the full cost of claims to be assessed, development over recent years shows that it now takes two years or less.
<P>
Even more significantly, during the 1980s the estimated total cost of claims then remained relatively constant as time passed, implying that, as individual cases were being negotiated and litigated, any good news was being balanced by adverse developments. But, in the 1990s, the overall estimated cost of claims has tended to reduce after their value has been assessed, which indicates that the ability to establish and maintain a claims handling strategy in each individual case avoids adverse developments, and produces better results.
<P>
This approach demands teamwork and a change in claims handling culture. It requires the owner, the club and the various other support services such as lawyers, club correspondents and surveyors to share the same objective.
<P>
In various sectors of all these industries there is a tendency to minimise the level of response and to hope for the best. It has been argued that the proactive approach simply encourages claimants to be more aggressive.  But the club's recent claims results show that this is not the case, and the managers are determined to improve on this even further.
<P>

<A NAME="Undertaking"><H3>Loss Prevention</H3></A>

CLUB letters of undertaking are an essential part of the P&amp;I system. They can save shipowners large sums of money by providing rapid and effective security when club members are faced with claims. But recent cases in South Africa have highlighted how lawyers acting for cargo interests can sometimes use the threat of demanding bank guarantees instead of accepting a letter of undertaking as a means of advancing their claims.
<P>
In some parts of the world, notably New Zealand, a letter of undertaking from an International Group P&amp;I Club has the same legal status as a bank guarantee, although, in most countries, courts will actually demand bank guarantees. In direct dealings with claimants, however, club letters of undertaking will very often be acceptable.
<P>
Claimants' lawyers in South Africa recently offered to accept a letter of undertaking as security for a cargo claim, but only if the member admitted that as vessel owners they were also the "carrier" of the cargo under the bill of lading. This would have put the member at a disadvantage, and the club refused to provide  letters of undertaking on such forms, preferring to put up a bank guarantee instead. The club makes every effort to provide letters of undertaking when members need security, and understands that this sort of case can cause delay and expense for owners. But members do understand that the club cannot allow the legal position of its members to be compromised simply in order to save bank charges or limited delay.

<A NAME="Corres"><H3>Correspondents - a two-way commitment</H3></A>
<TABLE><TD>A P&amp;I club correspondent is at the sharp end of delivering service to club members. It is to the correspondent that the hard-pressed shipmaster turns  with a problem, and the correspondent that must sort out tangled problems with local bureaucracy. Bilbrough prides itself on working closely with members, and the quality of the correspondents it appoints to represent it around the world is crucial. Garry Stevens,  the claims adjuster
in Bilbrough's London office who has recently taken over the day-to day responsibility for correspondents, says, "There's a two-way commitment. We have to make an effort to retain our links with correspondents even when there is a low level of work for them to do. The service we offer is very important to us, and the correspondents have to be as efficient as we are."
</TD><TD>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/lcn7_2.jpg" ALT="G Stevens" WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=142 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1><BR><I><FONT  SIZE=-1>Garry Stevens will be helping the club to strengthen its links with correspondents</CENTER></FONT></I><br><br>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Under the guidance of Ian Ferguson, the director with overall responsibility, Garry Stevens will be sharpening  the manager's focus on the worldwide network of club correspondents. "We don't often change correspondents," says Garry Stevens. "We've had relationships with some going back almost a hundred years. But it is too easy to lose touch. We are going to work hard to strengthen our links with our network, and we shall be looking for our correspondents to respond to that.
<P>
"We look for correspondents which are small firms with the right mix of expertise. Ideally, they should also be dedicated to P&amp;I work and have access to a wide range of local legal and technical advice. That means, in effect, that we encourage them to work for other clubs."  But conflicts of interest are rare.
<P>
Garry Stevens is expanding the information on correspondents which is already
available on the club's Internet Web Page. There, the interactive map of
correspondents leads members directly to the details of the local correspondent. "We will be putting further information behind that," says Garry Stevens, "so members and our own staff can get quickly to details of people in the organisation and the skills available. We want to receive information from correspondents, and we want to know what is happening in their country, even when there are no problems. We are going to take a critical look at our relations with all our correspondents, and set out to encourage those we don't hear from to understand the importance of keeping us up to date with local events which affect our members."
<P>
Bilbroughs also sees the role of the correspondent as one of lobbying for the P&amp;I movement as a whole. 
<P>
"It is one of the roles of the correspondent to educate local officials and other bodies as to what P&amp;I clubs are, what they can do, and what they can't do," says Garry Stevens.

<A NAME="Pandiman"><H3>Pandiman - focus on Philippines correspondent</H3></A>
FREDDIE Clemo won't necessarily  be the first person you meet when you visit the offices of Pandiman Philippines Inc, the club's correspondent in Manila. But Freddie is such a flamboyant character that it would not require a great leap of imagination to believe that he might be the first person you meet when you arrive in the Philippines.
<P>
Freddie, a UK shipping executive, arrived in the Philippines in 1950. He worked there for US Lines until 1968, when he retired and entered into a partnership with Filipino colleagues to represent a number of foreign shipping companies in the local market. In 1977, Freddie (right),<IMG SRC="images/lcn7_4.jpg" ALT="F Clemo" WIDTH=133	 HEIGHT=153 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>became a naturalised Filipino citizen and assumed sole proprietorship of Aquila Maritime Business Inc, which in 1982 launched Pandiman as a registered correspondent for P&amp;I clubs. 
<P>
Freddie has two right-hand men, both of them women - Cora Tabuena, who has just been promoted to co-manager, and Celia Ordinario, who, in addition to her other duties, spends a lot of time monitoring the effects of ITF contracts and the new regulations governing Filipino crew employment.
<P>
Freddie values his long association with the London Club. He says, "The personal relationship between us has greatly added to the effectiveness of claims handling procedures."
<P>
Freddie is a legendary figure in Philippines shipping circles. He is also one of a select band of shipping people to be awarded the MBE. When asked why he was given it, Freddie say, "One never knows what it is for, although they did say it was due to my efforts to promote British interests in the Philippines." And the rest.

<A NAME="Limit"><H3>Massive support for lower limits on cover</H3></A>
<TABLE><TD>THE overwhelming majority of London Club members say they want a substantially lower limit on overspill calls. Members with over seventy per cent of the club's tonnage replied to a
questionnaire seeking their views on the present twenty per cent compromise and its alternatives.
Members with ninety-five per cent of the tonnage were in favour of a lower limit, and most of
those, ninety per cent, called for overspill calls to be limited to between two and three per cent
of entered ships' Convention limits. Eighty-four per cent of those members went further, and
supported the idea of fixing limits at a level at which the International Group could obtain
reinsurance, which would leave members with no exposure at all to overspill calls.</TD><TD>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/lcn6_1.jpg" ALT="G Edmiston" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1><BR><I><FONT  SIZE=-1>Graham Edmiston says members from right across the club's membership support a lower limit on overspill calls</CENTER></FONT></I><br><br>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
Chairman of A Bilbrough & Co, Graham Edmiston, says, "We are encouraged by this level of
support, and especially by the fact that it has come from right across the spread of membership."
Forty-five per cent of the replies were from Greek tonnage, thirty-four per cent from the Far East and twenty per cent from Europe and the near East. 
<P>
"We have seen other clubs in favour of a limit receive similar support from their members," says Mr Edmiston. "We now believe that once the clubs in favour of a realistic limit agree on what 
that limit should be, they can win the support of the remainder of the International Group to that limit. There is growing acceptance that last year's compromise has not laid this difficult and divisive subject to rest, and that a lower limit will have to be agreed if group unity is to be maintained."

THE LONDON P&I Club's reserves surged by $43.79m to $81.48m during the 1995-96 policy
year, following several years of mild claims experience. And a strong investment return of 11.79
per cent for the year has boosted assets. "The club has never been in a stronger financial
position," says John M Lyras, chairman of the London Club.
<P>
The 1996 accounts for the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, approved
by the committee on July 3, show that the balance available in excess of estimated outstanding
claims has risen to $53m, or nineteen per cent of the claims. "We have worked hard to develop
this strong position," says Bryan Gaze, deputy chairman of A Bilbrough & Co. "We want to make
sure our members will not be faced with unexpected supplementary calls." A succession of years
with good claims experience has helped develop the reserves.

<A NAME="Poland"><H3>Pollution of Polish waters</H3></A>

CLUB members are exposed to substantial penalties for even negligible oil pollution in a variety
of jurisdictions. The most recent confirmation of this comes from Poland, where the club's
correspondent, Morska Agencja Gdynia (MAG), warns that "there is no direct connection
between the amount of fines imposed for pollution and the amount of pollutant leaked".
<P>
MAG points out that there is a strict obligation under Polish maritime law to inform port state
control of any trace of pollution of whatever nature. In the case of oil pollution, masters should immediately inform the local club correspondent and, where necessary, take samples and help with any investigation carried out by the Polish Maritime Board.
<P>
MAG says that fines for minor oil pollution in the port of Gdansk rarely exceed $10,000, but in
the port of Gdynia fines are never less than $50,000. Incidents of pollution in Polish territorial waters, meanwhile, are deemed much more serious, and fines imposed amount to "hundreds of thousands of dollars".
<P>
Fines imposed in Poland for pollution of Polish maritime waters are immediately 
executable under local law. Cash or appropriate bank guarantees covering the amount of any fine
are required by law.
<P>
It is therefore important that members exercise the utmost care and attention to pollution 
prevention and, where necessary, to reporting procedures, in whatever part of the world they are
operating to.
<P>

<A NAME="Partners"><H3>Good partners</H3></A>

Why use one P&I club rather than another?  Some owners might say rates matter most. Every owner wants to minimise expenditure on insurance. But the great majority look beyond the rate they pay for P&I cover. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn6_3.jpg" ALT="A Mavrakakis" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=110 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>Anthony Mavrakakis (left), a Piraeus-based tanker owner, has been a member of the London Club for five years. His fleet has been entered at various times with other group clubs, but he says he expects that any new tonnage he gets will go to the London Club. "I came to the London Club because of my personal link with Graham Edmiston, of Bilbroughs," says Mr Mavrakakis. "But we are very satisfied with the club. They are always there if we need help."
<P>
Mr Mavrakakis says club managers should be partners with the members. "They should act as if we were all in the same business," he says. "I think Bilbroughs thinks like that." Part of that way of thinking is helping owners when they need it, without being a soft touch for owners who should know better. Mr Mavrakakis says, "What makes a good club is well-organised members who don't waste the club's time. That way, the managers have time for the good members when they need it." Mutuality means equal time and support for each member. "We can call when we need help, and we get it," he says. "Bad members cost the rest of us, and good members have less claims anyway. We see that Bilbroughs is careful and selective and takes only good members."
<P>
Having a local office is a major point for Mr Mavrakakis. "Bilbroughs has a fully staffed Piraeus office, and we find that very useful," he says. "It is part of the professional attitude that I like. They identify with the owner's needs, not the manager's needs. Even when they employ a surveyor or a lawyer you get the feeling that they are working for the member. With some clubs it can feel that they are working to protect the managers or the club, which is not the same thing. Clubs are there to protect members against third party liabilities, not to protect the managers of the club."
<P>
What about representation? "It would be constructive if other clubs chose really professional
members for their boards, not just people who will give the managers an easy ride," insists Mr
Mavrakakis. "Too many clubs choose directors who are their friends, or who are yes-men," he
says. "It is much better for everyone to have owners on the board who have some real input. I am
very happy that the London Club and Bilbroughs think this way."
<P>
Does the question of limitation of liability influence his choice of  P&I Club? "My main concern
is that when I have a problem I am covered," says Mr Mavrakakis. "The exact limit on cover is
less important than the question of how it is fixed. We should be consulted, and listened to before these decisions are made. Bilbroughs does tell us what is going on, and it does listen to what we say. I like that."

<A NAME="Toxic"><H3>Toxic cargo problems</A></H3>

A NUMBER of incidents involving problems arising from the carriage of thiourea dioxide have
been drawn to the attention of the club's claims handlers. Overheating has resulted in claims for corrosion, discolouration and odour both to these cargoes and to other cargoes stowed in the same hold of the ship.
<P>
Thiourea dioxide is a moisture- and heat-sensitive toxic solid which, when shipped in plastic
bags in containers, can break down and begin to overheat and combust. It is not listed as a
hazardous cargo in the IMO dangerous goods code, but it is known that, when it starts to break
up, it produces sulphur dioxide, which is an irritant to the eyes, skin and respiratory system. 
<P>
Investigations into the causes of the overheating and combustion are continuing. Meanwhile,
members are warned to exercise extreme care when dealing with this cargo.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<A NAME="NYPE"><H3>NYPE agreement updated</A></H3>

THE International Group of P&I Clubs has updated the Inter-Club Agreement on the apportionment of cargo claims under the New York Produce Exchange charterparty. 
<P>
The 1996 Agreement follows the same basic format as the previous agreements which have become industry standard clauses over the last twenty-five years. The changes made since the last revision in 1984 broaden the definition  of cargo claims to include related customs  dues and fines and certain interest and costs. Claims arising under Through Transport or Combined Transport bills of lading are allowed, provided the damage was caused while the cargo was in the vessel. 
<P>
The Agreement now also applies to the Hamburg Rules and includes modification to the time bar provision. 
<P>
The club will be distributing copies of the new agreement to members, and it urges them to adopt it for all charterparties on the NYPE forms or the Asbatime Form 1981.

<A NAME="STCW"><H3>Brazil gets tough on STCW</A></H3>

PORT authorities in Brazil are taking strong action against ships which fail to produce certificates of crew competence on demand.

The club's correspondent in Santos, Representacoes Proinde Ltda, reports that four vessels - each flying a different flag - were recently detained by the port captain after failing to produce the  necessary documentation. 
<P>
Both national and foreign-flag vessels should ensure that they have on board the necessary certificates of crew competence - together with originals or properly authenticated photocopies of classification documents - in order to facilitate clearance through Brazilian ports. Failure to do so will oblige the owner or operator to arrange for replacement of the master and crew by
suitably qualified personnel. The alternative is for the ship to be barred from calling at Brazilian ports.

KEEN as ever to keep ahead of changes in technology, the London Club has set up an internet
website. "This is an important enhancement of our service to members," says Bilbroughs director
Lance Johnson.
<P>
The site has been designed for speed and ease of use. Initially, it will hold information about the club and the insured risks, copies of The London Club News and StopLoss Bulletins, plus an
online database of the club's correspondents around the world, which will be updated as changes
occur.

IF Martyn Hughes were a library book, he would be carrying a hefty fine. The London Club
borrowed him in 1990 and never gave him back. Today, he heads up the club's office in Piraeus,
which looks after the interests of its Greek membership.
<P>
The club borrowed Martyn, a qualified solicitor, from Holmans early in 1990 for "a couple of
months" to help it through a particularly busy renewal period. A few months later Martyn joined
Bilbroughs' staff, and in 1992 went out to Piraeus to become the third man in the Bilbroughs
office.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn6_5.jpg" ALT="M Hughes" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=110 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>"I'd always wanted to work overseas," says Martyn (left). "My father had worked overseas, so it didn't seem an odd thing to do." Greece, he felt, had a lot to offer young, free, single people. But he came anyway, and within little more than six months his wife - also a qualified solicitor - had given birth to the first of their two daughters.
<P>
The thing that strikes you about Martyn's office is that it is a working office. It isn't untidy, but it is dominated by files. "We do pretty much the same sort of work as they do in London," explains Martyn. "But having an office in Piraeus enables us to be closer to an important part of our membership, and it is tangible evidence of the club's commitment to those members."
<P>
There are a few things that Martyn and his family miss, like hearing English spoken around them,
and the green of the English countryside. But they don't miss the weather, or the commuting. For
the future, Martyn would like to improve his "atrocious" command of the Greek language, and
he wants to get out and meet more of the club's members. "Piraeus is a proper shipping community," he says. "It is like a village. In the end, this business is about relationships. We have to develop and maintain them in order to go forward."

<H3>Cutting out surprises</H3>

A good relationship with major European reinsurers is helping Bilbroughs to make sure club members
don't have any nasty surprises. But the London Club's managers haven't moved all of the club's
reinsurance away from London.  "The International Pool structure is there for major claims," says
Bryan Gaze, deputy chairman of Bilbroughs. "But we have to protect our members against the
consequences of a bad claims year. We have been able to find $23m of protection for the lower levels
for a premium of about $2.1m, which we think is sensible."
<P>
Bilbroughs has three layers of reinsurance for this year, much of it placed with Munich Re. "We
started two years ago insuring claims of $3m over a $2m excess for each claim," says Mr Gaze. 
"Munich Re provides seventy-five per cent of that cover. They are just putting a toe in the water of
reinsuring P&amp;I claims, and we are developing a good relationship." That relationship led to Bilbroughs
seeking cover for its own contribution to pool claims. Munich Re again led that, and the club now has
$25m cover with an excess of $5m for its own contributions to any pool claims. "Not all clubs do this,"
says Mr Gaze. "But we think it is prudent. We did try to reinsure our contribution to other clubs' pool
claims too, but Munich Re didn't like that idea. They are comfortable with us and our claims record,
but didn't want to go beyond that."
<P>
In a slightly controversial move, Bilbroughs led the London Club away from the International Group
joint proposal to cover the fifteen per cent vertical co-insurance of the pool which clubs took on this
year. "The idea was to distance the clubs from the London market and spread the risk," says Mr Gaze.
"But there were capacity problems which took them back to Lloyd's. So we thought it sensible to go
direct to Lloyd's to cover our exposure. There is no point in going elsewhere if the right cover is
cheaper in our traditional market."

<H3>Club sharpens  Far East focus</H3>               

THE Asian Shipowners Forum is a growing force in world shipping. Something like forty per cent of
world shipping is now owned and operated from the Asia Pacific region, and trading patterns will
make that percentage grow. 
<P>
Asian owners increasingly look for local services and partners who can
understand their particular needs and ways of looking at problems. Over thirty per cent of the LondonClub's membership is already drawn from the Far East, and the managers have extensive experience
in the region. But that will not be enough to ensure the club retains its leading position. 
<P>
New London
Club chairman John M Lyras is leading a drive to sharpen the club's focus on  Asia and will be
travelling with Graham Edmiston, chairman of A Bilbrough, and Lance Johnson, the director
responsible for the Far East, to Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur during May. "We want to
get closer to the managements of the members who make up such a large part of our club, and to hear
their views," says Mr Johnson. 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Talking Point</H3>

DURING his recent address to the Lloyd's of London Press 1st Asia-Pacific P&amp;I Conference in Hong
Kong, Lance Johnson provided examples of claims in a number of different categories which have
benefited from being handled on a representative basis by the club manager's Hong Kong office.
<P>
Speaking about problems involving stowaways and refugees, Mr Johnson told the conference that it
was important to maintain a good working relationship with immigration authorities. And he
recounted a story involving a vessel entered with the club which picked up some refugees while bound
from Bangkok to Hong Kong.
<P>
The refugees, who were packed tight in a badly leaking boat, were in a poor state of health. They
included a number of women and children. The master felt he had no alternative but to take them on
board.
<P>
When the vessel arrived in Hong Kong it was ordered to the Western Quarantine anchorage, where
the authorities boarded and began counting the refugees.  The first official number count produced a
staggering total of 1,002 people on board. But, following a second headcount the next day, the number
came out at 1,003. A third count was rendered unnecessary when it was discovered that a baby had
been born to one of the women during the night. We are reliably informed that Mr Johnson refrained from making any comment about the advantages of being in the club.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Liaison"></A><BR>
<H3>On-the-spot liaison</H3>
<P>
Why would a P&amp;I club choose to have an office in one of the most expensive places in the world? 
<P>
At the end of 1976, A Bilbrough decided to open an office in Hong Kong, for the simple reason that about a third of the business entered with the London Club came from members based there. And, according to Lance Johnson (right),<IMG SRC="images/lcn5_2.jpg" ALT="L Johnson" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=193 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right> director of A Bilbrough, making the most efficient use of time and maintaining a close liaison with members are two of the most compelling reasons for having set up and maintained the Hong Kong office.
<P>
Mr Johnson recently addressed the Lloyd's of London Press 1st Asia-Pacific P&amp;I Conference in Hong
Kong on the subject of "P&amp;I Claims Handling in Hong Kong". He  explained that working in a time
zone which is several hours ahead of London  has clear advantages. Mr Johnson pointed out that it is
possible for the Hong Kong office to have instructed correspondents, surveyors and/or lawyers and,
if necessary, to have provided security to prevent a vessel being arrested, all before London has started
work for the day.
<P>
Although it was originally intended that the Hong Kong office would handle only the claims of the
Hong Kong membership, the concept was so successful that it was extended to the majority of the Far
Eastern membership. And Mr Johnson used specific examples of claims to illustrate to the conference
the value to the club managers of having an office in a strategic geographical location. Whether
dealing with crew claims, stowaways and refugees, collisions, cargo claims, oil pollution, wreck
removal or any type of claim, there are clear advantages to on-the-spot 
representation.
<P>
It is not just claims which are dealt with by the Hong Kong office. Mr Johnson pointed out that the
club prefers to be proactive, and that having a permanent regional presence enables  the club to offer
on-the-spot advice on such matters as contracts of carriage, anticipated fixtures and the carriage of
intended cargoes. "Prevention is better than cure," said Mr Johnson.
<P>
The club managers have legally trained staff in the Hong Kong office who can handle various disputes
for which there is cover available under the FD&amp;D class. Having a presence in Hong Kong has
enabled the club managers on a number of occasions to handle disputes through to a successful
conclusion at arbitration, including the preparation of submissions, thereby saving on legal costs.
<P>
Mr Johnson told the conference that having a presence in Hong Kong enables the staff to gain what
he called "local knowledge". He said, "I recall, when I was based in Hong Kong, it was difficult for
those in London to comprehend why on earth we should need to close the Hong Kong office merely
because a typhoon was passing by."  Spoken like a native.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<A NAME="Circulars"></A>
<H3>Club Circulars published in booklet form</H3>

INFORMATION is one of the prime assets of any P&amp;I club. But that information is useless if it is not
shared amongst those who stand to benefit from it.
<P>
The London Club's policy of issuing circulars on matters of importance to members has for a number
of years been a fundamental part of its planned dissemination of information. Now the club has
brought together many of those circulars in one compact volume for the convenience of members.
<P>
The booklet contains reprints of various circulars that the club considers to be either relevant or
important. It does not contain reprints of all previous circulars, some of which may also still be
relevant, and so should be regarded not as a definitive work of reference but as a useful compendium
for easy reference.
<P>
Some circulars have been included for reference purposes, even though they are out of date. Care
should also be taken over references to specific rules which may subsequently have been amended.
<P>
The booklet contains a host of information on a wide variety of subjects. Here you will find everything
from last year's high-profile Limit on Club Cover circular, through the detached-back-of-the-settee
charm of 1964's Smuggling in India circular, to the thankfully largely unplumbed depths of the
seminal Berth Standard of Average Clause to be Renamed Charterers' Contribution Clause of 1971.
Bedside reading for the technician and historian alike. 
<P>
<I>If you would like a copy of the Circulars booklet, you should contact Lance Johnson on +44 (0)171 772 8000, or using this <A HREF="mailto:webmail@a-bilbrough.co.uk" onMouseOver="self.status='E-mail form pre-addressed to A Bilbrough &amp; Co';return true">e-mail form</A>.</I>

<BR>
<H3>Brazil crew crackdown </H3>

BRAZIL is cracking down on certificates relating to crew competence and classification requirements
in respect of both national and foreign-flag vessels calling at the country's ports.
<P>
The Brazilian Directorate of Ports and Coasts has issued a decree stipulating that the qualification certificates of crew members on both coastwise and foreign-trading vessels must be checked for compliance with STCW requirements. 
<P>
Failure to produce the proper crew qualification certificates will result in a demand on the part of the 
authorities that the shipowner or operator replace the relevant crew members with properly qualified
personnel. Vessels which fail to comply with these rules will not be allowed to clear Brazilian ports.
<P>
Original certificates - or properly authenticated photocopies - relating to crew competence and
covering the classification details of vessels have to be presented to the Brazilian authorities under the
new regulations.
<P>
Pandibra, the club's correspondent in Santos, says members should ensure that their owned or
chartered vessels comply with the new regulations before fixing to Brazil.

<H3>Florida's COFR ruling</H3>
<P>
FLORIDA has changed its policy regarding Certificates of Financial Responsibility (COFRs) for
vessels carrying pollutants. Owners and operators of such vessels must now exhibit, on request when
in Florida waters, a current copy of a United States Coast Guard-issued COFR to officials of the
Department of Environmental Protection of the State of Florida. Possession of a COFR eliminates the
need to file a Vessel Financial Security Statement with the Florida authorities.

<H3>First Person</H3>
<P>
STEVE Roberts was one of the first trainee claims handlers taken on by Bilbroughs straight from
school. He is also one of only two who has stayed the course. "I've been here thirteen years now," says
Steve. "I can't see me moving on. I don't think I would find the member-conscious 
philosophy we have here anywhere else." 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn5_4.gif" ALT="S Roberts" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=108 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>Steve (left) is ambitious, and wants to climb the management ladder in Bilbroughs. As an assistant director
with responsibility for claims handling for the Greek members, he works with a team of claims
handlers and adjusters. "I allocate work, encourage people when I can, follow up on problems and
from time to time visit the members so that they can keep personal contact," says Steve. "There is a
tremendous team feeling here, it's a youthful team and with a slimmer management structure we see
more decisions delegated to us."
<P>
One thing that Steve has delegated himself is the helm of the 505 dinghy he races with his wife, Sue.
"She is the skipper," smiles Steve, "I crew because I am unbearable as helmsman." He hasn't delegated
work on the Lotus Elan Sport he has been rebuilding for nearly eight years. That 
explains why it is taking so long, because Steve himself puts in more hours at Bilbroughs than is really
sensible. "The only thing that irritates me a bit here is having to do some of my own typing," says
Steve with a grin. "It's only because the secretaries don't stay to seven in the evening." According to 
Steve,  working late is a temporary phase, but one that never seems to end.
<P>
If that sounds a bit of a marathon, Steve is training for that too, running seriously with his two dogs,
one a neurotic pointer and the other a soppy bull terrier cross which Steve says is totally loyal. Some
might say the same about Steve and his attitude to Bilbroughs. He wouldn't dispute that. "This is a
respectful company which treats people well, you feel that you are taken seriously," he says.

<H3>Summer sports</H3>
<P>
Summer comes around, and the sporting season starts. First off the blocks was the six-a-side football
team. Hugh Brennan says three matches have already been played this year, against the UK Club,
Jackson Parton and Thomas Cooper. Hugh still hopes to get a team into the Lloyd Thompson
six-a-side tournament. Volunteers?
<P>
The first cricket match this year will be against Holmans on June 25, and Chris Nason is negotiating
more fixtures. Tina Warwick says she can make a rounders team available to play at any of the cricket
fixtures.
<P>
Marcus Bucknall is organising  sailing teams for the Brookes Bell Mari-Team Racing at Millwall docks.
<P>
Mental agility has had its day, with a company quiz night on April 17. The winning team was Claire Boggas, Ernie Chaplin, Keeley Goodge and Chris Nason. Lance Johnson's team would have done better if he had been allowed "P&amp;I Rules 1965-1967" as a specialist topic.

<H3>Rating clubs - more than a numbers game</H3>

COMPETITION is forcing P&amp;I clubs to become less like clubs and more like commercial insurers. But the clubs are trying
to do that while retaining the essence of mutuality which gives them a market advantage. That essence - good service
born out of long relationships and the idea that shipowners should be buying insurance at cost through the club -
makes it difficult to analyse the financial performance of clubs in a realistic way. Yet every year US-based Standard
&amp; Poor tries to do just that. It takes the clubs' annual published accounts, sends out a short questionnaire, puts the
numbers into a magic box and produces its Marine Mutual Report.  The report rates all the clubs. But how much use
is it?
<P>
According to Bryan Gaze, vice-chairman of A Bilbrough &amp; Co, it is getting more useful as it develops. But as a rating
system it is still deeply flawed. "One big problem is the timing," says  Mr Gaze. "The report comes out in February,
which means that a lot of the information on which it is based is two years out of date by the time it can be used
by a shipowner thinking about renewals." As an example, Mr Gaze points to the way reserves are assessed, and the
weight given to them in the report. "Our reserves at the time of publishing our annual report in 1995 were $16.4m,"
he says. "After this February, they will be about $46m. Yet this report comes out now based on the $16m figure. It
is not very helpful to anyone."

Mr Gaze says the benefit of the S&amp;P report is that the publicity it generates is pushing clubs towards a greater degree
of financial openness. "We have led the drive towards clearer and more useful P&amp;I club accounts," says Mr Gaze. "S&amp;P
helps to push some of the others. But there are still many things, such as reinsurance programmes, the ability to
assess outstanding claims and the ability to collect debts, which S&amp;P cannot assess objectively. So in practice there
is no useful difference between the two- and three-flag ratings it awards."

<A NAME="Renewal"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Firm renewals in soft climate</H3>

THIS year's renewals had one disappointment for the London Club, but there was a lot of good news too. "We are
disappointed that World-Wide moved tonnage away," says Graham Edmiston, chairman of A Bilbrough. "But we have
gained some interesting fleets and overall we had a good renewal."
<P>
According to Mike Hill, senior underwriting director, the general climate was soft, but his team was firm on rates. "We
have kept our premium income up," says Mr Hill. "We didn't soften rates. It would not benefit the members in the
long term." Following the renewal, the London Club now has 25.4m gt of direct entered tonnage. With the reinsured
American Club tonnage and charterers' entries, the club has over 30m gt of entered 
tonnage. 
<P>
World-Wide's joint-venture company with Chinese interests still has its bulk carriers with the London Club. Almost
700,000 gt of new tonnage was entered, including 310,000 gt of bulk carriers in the Trade &amp; Transport fleet, 198,000
gt owned by the Turkish Marti group, 90,000 gt from Transmed and 75,000 gt from leading shipmanager V Ships. The
estimated total call will be $100m. An estimated 3.5 per cent saving on reinsurance costs was passed on to the
members.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Chairman"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Continuity and balance</H3>

THE London Club has a new and young chairman. Should the members and managers be bracing themselves
for the new broom? John M Lyras smiles. "My priorities as chairman will be to develop both the strength of the club,
in tonnage and economic terms, and the strength of the managers and board, to give us continuity," he says.  "The
financial strength is there, now I want us to develop the geographical balance and emphasise that we are a club in
which a well-managed fleet would feel at home."
<P>
Mr Lyras comes from a traditional shipping family, and his father was a director of the London Club for eighteen
years. Mr Lyras has been on the board for fifteen years and is the first Greek chairman of the London Club. "I am
proud of that," says Mr Lyras, "and proud to acknowledge the practical hands-on interest that our Greek members
take in the club. The directors and the managers appreciate that. I see it as one of my tasks to get owners from
other regions to take such an active role."
<P>
Later this year Mr Lyras and Graham Edmiston, chairman of the club managers, A Bilbrough &amp; Co, will be making a
major trip to the Far East in a bid to emphasise and develop the club's important ties with that region. "We will be
looking for members who want to join us not just for our reputation for good service, but because they will fit in with
the well-run tonnage we have," says Mr Lyras. "We would like more medium-size fleets with dynamic owners."
<P>
Mr Lyras wants that balance in the managers and on the club board too. "I want to build up a continuity of structure
through the management to the top, and through the board," says Mr Lyras. "That means not being afraid to employ
the people we need, from different cultures, people who can bring something to the club and strengthen it."  
<P>
Last year, as vice-chairman of the club and using his influence on the numerous bodies where he holds office, Mr
Lyras was a leader in the campaign to reduce limits on catastrophe calls. The London Club was portrayed as being
less than enthusiastic about the unity of the International Group. Mr Lyras sees it differently. "I strongly believe in
the importance of the International Group, " he says. "It is getting more important, not weaker. But perhaps its
structure is not keeping up with the times. Shipowners, club members, want more say in how their clubs are run.
Managers have to take into account owners' priorities, as well as their own. Owners respect the club managers, but
want that respect to be mutual. As chairman of the London Club, I will be pushing for the International Group to
develop the same relationship between managers and members as has developed in our club." 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Talking point</H3>

GRAHAM Edmiston, chairman of A Bilbrough &amp; Co, gave a paper to the recent P&amp;I - Is There A Future For Mutuality?
conference in London. The title of Mr Edmiston's paper was "Has The Catastrophe Debate Changed The Relationship
Between Managers And Members?" 
<P>
Having reviewed the historical background to the manager/member relationship, and provided a concise summary of
the catastrophe limitation debate, Mr Edmiston concluded that the relationship had changed. He pointed out that
the public nature of the limitation debate had accelerated a process of change which had already been under way.<P>
"Competition and globalisation were already forcing club managers to pay close attention to the needs of their
members," concluded Mr Edmiston. "But this debate has shown both managers and members that club boards don't
always represent the full scope of the membership. It has shown club boards that they should not take for granted
what managers tell them. The result is that clubs will have to tell their members more, and members will demand
more of their clubs. This is surely a healthy change for P&amp;I as a whole."
<P>
The two-day conference was attended by a hundred delegates from a number of different countries. It included
speakers from mutual clubs, club managers, shipowners, P&amp;I brokers, law firms and accountants.

<BR>
<H3>Malaysia coastal controls</H3>

MALAYSIA is taking a tough stance on illegal discharge and sludge dumping. It is pushing for standard operations and
communications procedures to be introduced throughout the ASEAN region.
<P>
Malaysia is particularly concerned in this respect about tankers which have undertaken what are deemed to be illegal
ship-to-ship transfers in Malaysian territorial waters. 
<P>
On several occasions, the Malaysian authorities have detained ships following such alleged offences. Spica Services (S)
Pte Ltd, the club's correspondent in Singapore, says owners should be aware that ship-to-ship operations have in
the main been moved away from areas which might be considered to overlap Indonesian and Singaporean waters,
particularly the southern end of the Malacca Straits. Spica emphasises that advice is available locally on currently
preferred areas.
<P>
The Malaysian authorities also contend that sludge dumping is invariably connected to ship-to-ship
transfers. Spica says that monitoring of the area, including naval and air force surveillance, has been stepped up, and
advises ships which are going to deballast prior to cleaning or docking to do so before entering Malaysian waters.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Santos"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Warning on Santos piracy</H3>

INADEQUATE security in major Brazilian ports has prompted the London Club's correspondent in Santos, Pandibra, to
issue a list of recommended procedures to follow in the event of pirates boarding vessels at Santos Roads. The pirates
are normally armed but not violent, so crew members are advised not to resist if they are held hostage. 
<P>
Any incident
should be reported as soon as possible to the police, port captain and customs. New seals should be placed on any
open containers. It is vital that the authorities are advised of incidents without delay.
<P>

<BR>
<H3>Loss Prevention - Ivory Coast...</H3>

CUSTOMS in Adibjan have resumed the imposition of heavy fines on vessels for infringements of regulations, and
particularly for non-declaration of bunkers.
<P>
The London Club's correspondent in Abidjan, Eltvedt &amp; O'Sullivan, cites a recent example involving a vessel on a
regular liner run to Abidjan which failed to declare bunkers on board and was fined Ffr6.69m. Following some lengthy
negotiations, the fine was reduced to Ffr230,000 ($46,000).
<P>
Eltvedt &amp; O'Sullivan says it can find no reference in the Abidjan customs code to any requirement to declare bunkers
on board. Management at the maritime branch of the customs authorities, however, insists that a decree to this effect
has been published. 
<P>
Eltvedt &amp; O'Sullivan advises that, pending further investigation, it would be prudent for all masters visiting the IvoryCoast to declare bunkers on board when entering Abidjan.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>...and Turkey</H3>
OMUR Marine Ltd, in Istanbul, Turkey, has reminded members about restrictions currently in force against vessels
operating from ports in southern Cyprus. The Turkish maritime authorities have forbidden any vessel, of any flag,
entry to Turkish ports if it has come directly from a port in southern Cyprus. Vessels not registered in southern
Cyprus will be allowed to call at Turkish ports if they have called previously at a foreign port.

<H3>First Person</H3>

THE first person into the Bilbrough office in Leman Street in the morning is Jim McGrane (below). As Office Services Supervisor
he is there every day before six o'clock, making sure the building's systems are up and running properly. Jim is also
the first person to write the history of the Bilbrough family. After twenty-two years in the Army and ten years
making Bilbrough's offices run smoothly, Jim seems an unlikely historian. "When we were moving offices I started to
read the archived letters of the family," says Jim. "That was back in 1987, and I got more and more fascinated with
the history of the family. You could see everything through the documents of the time." Jim went through seven
thousand letters in fourteen volumes. It took him seven years.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn4_4.gif" ALT="J J McGrane" WIDTH=132 HEIGHT=127 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>
He wrote the family history, which was then published by Bilbroughs to coincide with the centenary of Tower Bridge,
in 1994. Now Jim is busy on another Bilbrough family project, writing a book on the war diaries of the family. "I'm
hoping to have it published independently," says Jim. Any money coming from that will take Jim and his wife of
thirty-one years standing to Singapore on holiday. Jim remembers Singapore from his army days, when he travelled
extensively all over the world. But today he says he enjoys coming to work, and doesn't miss the Army at all.
<P>
"The only thing I miss nowadays," smiles Jim, "is when I go shopping at Lakeside and I'm not getting paged all day
on the tannoy." Jim has a reputation as a joker, and as Mr Fixit, so he is continually paged at Bilbrough. When he is
not making the building run smoothly, or making jokes, he is making a museum of old publications and artefacts
which will sit in a new cabinet in reception. "This isn't just a building to me," says Jim. "It runs like a ship, and I
take a real interest in P&amp;I. I like to be able to talk to the adjusters and really know what is going on."

<H3>Still debating the limitation issue</H3>

1995 probably saw more column inches in the shipping press devoted to the London Club than in any other year in
the club's 130-year history, much of it as a result of the club's rejection of the twenty per cent limitation proposal,
which was put to club boards or committees in April 1995.
<P>
The club committee was unanimous  in rejecting this proposal - which produced a  theoretical limit on club cover
of about $20bn - and in  stipulating that the limit should be set at a realistically collectable level.
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/lcn3_1.gif" ALT="M G Edmiston" WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=154 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1><br><br><FONT  SIZE=-1><I>A Bilbrough &amp; Co chairman<br> Graham Edmiston - the managers of the London Club are in no doubt that their first duty lies towards their members</I></FONT><br><br></CENTER></TD>
<TD>
The London Club's position gathered support among shipowners and shipowners' associations as the voice of
commercial reality and common sense. A number of shipowners' associations, from the Union of Greek Shipowners to
the Asian Shipowners' Forum, have now come out in favour of a lower limit. A number of P&amp;I clubs followed the London
Club's lead in criticising the compromise proposal  but, apart from the Swedish Club, which finally rejected the 
proposal in October but agreed to implement it in November, the three other clubs  in favour of a limit reluctantly
went along with the compromise proposal. However, an overwhelming majority of members of the UK Club have now
voted in favour of a realistically collectable limit, and the managers expect pressure from owners in various clubs and
owners'  associations to lead to a reduction in the limit on cover within the next two years. 
</TD></TR></TABLE>
The London Club and its
managers have been criticised in some quarters for bringing division and acrimony into the club community, but are
in no doubt whatsoever that their first duty lies towards their own members and that their first priority is their own
members' best interests.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Promoting loss prevention</H3>
READERS of this newsletter should by now have seen the first issue of a new quarterly publication from the London
Club - the StopLoss Bulletin.
<P>
The club is very aware of the vital role to be played by the promotion of loss prevention  awareness. It prides itself
on its quick response to claims made against its members, but it doesn't allow its determination to handle those
claims quickly and efficiently to prevent it from looking behind the incidents which give rise to the claims in the first
place.
<P>
The club has a Claims Review Body which each month reviews all live claims where the total estimated cost of
settlement has altered by more than $100,000 during the period under review. The purpose of this is twofold. First,
to monitior the development of the club's claims experience throughout the course of any given policy year. And,
second, to observe claims on an individual case basis to make sure that everything that should have been done has
been done and to confirm that individual claims handlers have a proper grasp of what is required of them.
<P>
The London Club is committed to improving loss prevention awareness throughout the industry. And it sees its
StopLoss Bulletin as an important part of the education process.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Australia"></A><BR>
<H3>Loss prevention in Australia</H3>

AUSTRALIA rightly enjoys a sound reputation for the efficiency of its port state control procedures. And the club's
legal correspondent in Sydney, Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth, tells us it has recently received the PSC figures for 1994 from
the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). This shows a total of 2,406 inspections and an increasing number of
detentions - 153 as against 72 the previous year.
<P>
Ships from a total of 72 countries were inspected during the year. The total number of individual ship visits to all
Australian ports in that time was 11,800, of which it is estimated that 4,198 were foreign ships not inspected during
the previous six months.
<P>
AMSA placed particular emphasis on the inspection of dry bulk carriers, which in 1994 accounted for over seventy per
cent of vessels detained. Meanwhile, deficiencies in lifesaving appliances and firefighting equipment accounted for more
than fifty per cent of all deficiencies recorded. It can therefore be expected that AMSA will pay particular attention
to these items in future years.
<P>
Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth tells us that, in view of the increasing attention being paid by the Australian government to
marine safety, and the findings contained in its 1994 report, AMSA can be expected to have achieved, if not increased,
its inspection rate during 1995.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Size/claims"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Size up, claims down</H3>

"WHEN talking to prospective members about The London Club, they show most interest in our falling claims costs,"
says Mike Hill (right), underwriting director of A Bilbrough &amp; Co, managers of the London Club. "We are proud of our record,
which has seen claims cost per ton fall by thirty per cent since 1990. But it is no accident. We have a focused
underwriting policy, and that is what has produced these benefits for our members."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn3_2.gif" ALT="M D M Hill" WIDTH=127 HEIGHT=131 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>
The most noticeable part of the London Club's underwriting policy is a shift towards larger bulk vessels. "We don't
exclude smaller vessels," says Mr Hill. "We welcome all good owners. But we do see that larger vessels, with their
reduced number of port calls, tend to have a lower incidence of claims. We have focused on these ships, and seen
our average size of vessel rise by fifty per cent from 18,000 gt in 1990 to 28,000 gt today."
<P>
Following this policy has led to the London Club taking top spot in the league of vessel sizes. But size isn't everything.
"We have concentrated our resources in the areas we understand," says Mr Hill, who emphasises that it is also a
question of management resources. "We want to understand the risks we are going into," he says.
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that new vessels operate with less problems than old ones," says Mr Hill. "The age of
our fleet is now below the world average, and we would like to keep it that way. In general it benefits all the
members to be part of a young fleet. "Last year, Mr Hill and his team turned away 240 potential members, with over
600 ships. "Most of them did not fit our criteria for size, age or type of operation," says Mr Hill. "But some simply
don't reach our 
quality threshold. We look for members with quality operating standards and strong financial backing."
<P>
Mr Hill says the club wants to expand, but not at any price. "We have grown 45 per cent in tonnage terms since 1990,
and we want to continue with that steady growth," he points out. 
<P>
He adds, "There is strong competition now, especially with so many split fleets. But we don't compete at any cost.
Maintaining the level of advance calls so that there are no nasty surprises later is most important." 
<P>
The whole underwriting policy is founded on the idea of selectivity. "Shipowners recognise that there is sub-standard
shipping about. Good shipowners recognise that we exclude bad ones, which helps us to attract the right people," says
Mr Hill. "And when the right people come, they find a concentrated underwriting team here in London. We have

<H3>New Zealand law reform</H3>

NEW Zealand has recently undergone the biggest revision of its maritime law in living memory. This culminated in the
coming into force last year of  the Transport Law Reform Bill. 
<P>
Not all provisions of the new legislation will have immediate effect because New Zealand has still to ratify, for example,
the International Convention on Salvage 1989. But there are some significant changes, and P&amp;I Services of Wellington
has summarised the main aspects of the new legislation which will be of interest to the club and its members.
<P>
New Zealand adopted the Hague Visby Rules with respect to outward shipments on bills of lading issued after February
1995. It has made no mention in the new legislation of the Hamburg Rules. The Sea Carriage of Goods Act 1940 has
been repealed and, with it, the provision whereby a ship's agent could be sued in respect of cargo claims. The 1976
Limitation Convention anomaly on the definition of an owner - which did not include charterers - has been tidied
up.
<P>
Provision has been made for the 1989 Salvage Convention to become part of New Zealand law at a later date.
<P>
Title to sue issues have been addressed through amendment of the Mercantile Law Act 1908, bringing into New Zealand
law provisions similar to those contained in the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992.
<P>
The Convention-based approach to pollution issues has been carried through in the new legislation. The current
overlap between the Marine Pollution Act 1974 and the Resource Management Act 1991 will be removed through the
eventual repeal of the Marine Pollution Act. Provision has been made for New Zealand to adopt MARPOL. And a system
of planning and response for oil spills has been established.

<H3>Nigeria immigration reminder</H3>

FAILURE to comply with the stringent immigration regulations in force in Nigeria could result in serious repercussions
for ships operating to that country. Pandiship, a correspondent in West Africa, has circulated the club with details
of a recent communication issued by the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), which all club members are asked to note
well.
<P>
The NIS circular points out, among other things, that all passengers on vessels entering Nigeria must have entry visas
or be covered by visa abolition agreements. Trainees, supercargoes and wives and children of crew are considered to
be passengers for this purpose.
<P>
All crew must  have seamen's books or valid Nigerian visas in their passports, and all non-Nigerian citizens who are
required to sign on as members of a crew in Nigeria must do so with the immigration authorities.
<P>
Non-Nigerian crew must not be discharged in Nigeria without the approval of the immigration authorities, and all such
crew will be given transit permits on leaving the vessel.
<P>
Stowaways apprehended in Nigeria will be treated as prohibited immigrants and will not be allowed into the country.
Repatriation costs will be borne by shipowners or agents, and owners or their representatives will be penalised.
Penalties are likely to be particularly severe in the case of prohibited immigrants of Nigerian nationality.

<H3>First Person</H3>

JOHN Williams (below, pictured <I>without</I> pipe), head of Bilbroughs office in Hong Kong, was called to the bar in 1975. There is no record of whether
or not he walked there, but there is a fair chance he did.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn3_4.jpg" ALT="J Williams" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=140 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>
John, who lists hill walking as one of his main recreations, joined Bilbroughs in October 1977. He moved to the Hong
Kong office in June 1980, initially for a one-year stint, and has been there ever since.
<P>
John has had a close involvement with the Korean market for a number of years, and in 1988 he brought his work
home when he married his delightful Korean wife. A daughter, Constance Emily Rebecca, was born in December 1992.
<P>
The Hong Kong office was set up almost twenty years ago, and is staffed by expartriate and Chinese-speaking people.
It is a vital part of the London Club operation, with between thirty and thirty-five per cent of the club's business
emanating from the Asia region.
<P>
John enjoys life in Hong Kong, and he enjoys also looking after the Far East membership. If he could walk to work
he surely would. As it is, he is a familiar figure on the No 28 light bus, going to and from the office each day. He isn't
mean. He just doesn't like wasting money on taxis.
<P>
John is also a familiar figure sitting outside his office door, reading through his files and smoking his pipe, or a good
cigar . He doesn't suffer from claustrophobia. It's just that it has been known for the fumes from his pipe to reach
the rest of the staff, courtesy of the office air conditioning system. John is also an inveterate eater of curries, the
hotter the better. Clearly a man who warrants his own office. John is obviously considerate, if not flamboyant. His
main vice is said to be a compulsion to buy made-to-measure suits. He is believed to have over thirty, almost all
of them grey - a rather  inappropriate colour for one of the best-known club people in the Far East.

<H3>Financial strength vital to future of mutuality</H3>

Shipowners do not want to be hit by unexpected supplementary calls," says Russell Peters (pictured below), chairman of the London
Club. "That means clubs must build up not only sufficient assets to cover known and expected liabilities, but must
also retain a flexible surplus to allow them to cope with unexpected claims without having to make large
supplementary calls which owners have not budgeted for."
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn2_1.gif" ALT="R Peters" WIDTH=93 HEIGHT=133 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>
Mr Peters commented on the need for a conservative approach to calls shortly after the London Club board considered
proposals for a general rate increase for the 1996/97 year. The 1995/96 year is showing an impressive investment
performance for the club, and so far the claims experience of the London Club has not reflected the rising trend seen
by other majors. Mr Peters says the committee questioned managers closely over the justification for a rate increase
against this background.
<P>
"We understand that there is a general trend of raising claims for all the clubs," says Mr Peters. "And we know well
that the doctrine of pure mutuality, where you collect only what you need when you need it, can lead to an
uncomfortable position." The committee is considering a modest increase in the standard advance call, with any
surplus that might arise going towards the Call Equalisation Account. This fund stands at $14m, providing a buffer
against unexpected  supplementary calls.
<P>
Mr Peters  has been at the forefront of rebuilding the club's financial strength following the need for large calls in
1990. "Mutuality will always be better than commercial insurance," says Mr Peters. "But owners don't like surprises.
They prefer strong clubs. It is no coincidence that as our assets and reserves have grown, so has our entered
tonnage."
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>   
<A NAME="Debate"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Clubs call for more debate</H3>

FOUR influential clubs in the International Group have backed calls by the London Club for more debate on the issue
of catastrophe liability. And one club, the West of England, has called for a radical rethink of the way the
International Group makes decisions. Graham Edmiston, chairman of A Bilbrough, says the whole question of liability
limits must be taken out of the spotlight and debated more thoroughly between the clubs, their managers and their
members. "It was a mistake to try and push this compromise through too quickly," says Mr Edmiston.
<P>
Mr Edmiston says  shipowners may  now press for a greater involvement in the formulation of P&amp;I policy on key issues,
to avoid the controversy which has arisen over the question of limitation. "A working group of a few managers
effectively presented the members of all clubs with a fait accompli," says Mr Edmiston. "But shipowners want and
deserve the opportunity to debate matters which affect them in such a vital way."
<P>
Initial attempts by clubs opposed to limits on liability to impose a moratorium on discussion  were first rejected by
the London Club. Since then, the Swedish Club has followed this lead and the North of England and UK Clubs have
declined to support a moratorium.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Bermuda"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Restructuring combines flexibility and tradition</H3>

THE London Club is to restructure its Bermuda operations in order to gain flexibility. From February 20, 1996, ninety
per cent of P&amp;I and FD&amp;D risks will be reinsured with a Bermuda-based parallel company, The London Steam-Ship
Owner's Mutual Insurance Association (Bermuda) Ltd.  
<P>
This will replace the present arrangement under which the same percentage of the risks is reinsured with a
Bermuda-based subsidiary, the London &amp; Bermuda Reinsurance Co Ltd. 
<P>
A structured reinsurance programme, designed to protect the interests of members, is of increasing importance to
marine mutuals such as the London Club 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/lcn2_2.gif" ALT="B C Gaze" WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=129 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>
Bryan Gaze (right), deputy chairman and financial director of A Bilbrough, says the new structure will give the club the
flexibility it needs to cope with modern conditions,  while maintaining the traditional base in  London. 
<P>
Russell Peters, current chairman of the London Club, will assume the chairmanship of LSSO(B), which will have a
separate board to the London Club committee. But all members entering or renewing entries of ships in Class 5 (P&amp;I)
or Class 8 (FD&amp;D) for the 1996/7 policy year will automatically become members of LSSO(B) as well as the London Club.
Parallel membership will be made a condition of entry.
<P>
"We have had a parallel company in Bermuda since 1978, but it has never traded," says Mr Gaze. "Now we have looked
at the geographical composition of our membership, the new regulatory regime for insurance  in Europe and the
demands of long-term strategic tax planning, and it makes sense to move to a parallel rather than a subsidiary
structure."
<P>
The London Club will continue to be regulated by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, and the results of the
Bermuda company will be aggregated with the London operations in published financial statements. 
<P>
<I>For information on the financial affairs and structure of  the London Club please ring Bryan Gaze, deputy chairman,

<H3>Loss Prevention</H3>

BUNKER fuel short delivery disputes are very common and can be very contentious. Chief engineers and bunker barge
operators in some parts of the world are notorious for having a few extra tons up their sleeve. Salters Marine
Consultants of Athens says this sort of malpractice may be on the wane, because surveyors are becoming more vigilant
and simply because of the number of times bunker surveys are carried out when vessels go on and off hire. But it
adds that some highly innovative 'sleeves' have been created in which to secrete the few extra tons. 
<P>
Salters warns that the chief engineer and surveyor should check the bunker receipt before bunkering takes place.
The tanks of the receiving vessel and the bunker barge should then be carefully measured to ascertain the exact
quantities on both vessels. Once the measuring has taken place, the quantity on board the barge should be calculated
using officially approved calibration tables. Salters says it has encountered poor quality, non-approved tables, and
even cases where no tables have been made available and where the attending surveyor has been asked to accept the
customs loading chit as proof of quantity on board. Salters warns that, if no tables are provided, the fuel on the barge
should be rejected, even if there is a delivery meter onboard. The veracity of fuel meters should be regarded as
suspect, even when meter correction factors and calibration certificates are present.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="Chinese">
<BR>
<H3>Chinese time limitation</A></H3>

EXTENSIONS of time limits for bringing proceedings in maritime law cases in China may no longer be valid following
a recent ruling of the Supreme People's Court of China. Following a meeting of judges from all Chinese maritime
courts, the Supreme Court issued a protocol stating that stipulations in respect of limitation of time in the maritime
code of the People's Republic of China must be strictly adhered to. This means that any agreement reached between
parties to extend time limits for starting legal proceedings will be invalid.
<P>
Huatai Insurance Agency &amp; Consultant Service Ltd of Shanghai warns that any dispute falling within Chinese
jurisdiction which can't be settled amicably within the agreed time limit  should now automatically be brought to
the courts by one of the parties. Failing this, the dispute will not be heard by the courts, which will deem invalid
any agreement on time extensions which might exist between the parties.
<P>
The Maritime Code of the PRC stipulates a one-year time limit for bringing claims against the carrier in a carriage
of goods by sea dispute, and two years under a voyage charter party agreement. There is a three-year limit in respect
of pollution claims. A one-year time limit applies to General Average contributions. It is therefore important to be
alert to the need to start proceedings within one year of the issuance of the adjustment in circumstances where cargo
interests fail to pay General Average contributions.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<A NAME="US damages"></A>
<BR>
<H3>Punitive damages ruling in US</H3>

THE US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that punitive damages can no longer be awarded in
maintenance and cure cases. The ruling was handed down in the case of Guevera v Maritime Overseas Corp. 
<P>
The trial court had found that maintenance payments had been willfully and callously withheld from an injured
seaman, who was awarded punitive damages. Subsequently, the question before the Supreme Court was whether the
Miles concept, set forth in the 1990 Supreme Court decision in Miles v Apex Marine Corp, precluded recovery of
punitive damages in maintenance and cure cases. It was held that it did.
<P>
The Fifth Circuit has now adopted the view that punitive damages cannot be awarded in an action based on the
wrongful withholding of maintenance payments, although a seaman can still recover attorneys' fees incurred to obtain
maintenance and cure wrongfully denied.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

<H3>Deep draft problems in deep south</H3>

THE US Coast Guard has reminded shipowners and operators of  their  responsibilities under US law following recent
incidents of steering and main propulsion failures on deep-draft vessels calling at ports in southern Texas. The
coastguard has drawn owners' attention to the fact that no vessel can enter or get under way in US waters unless
it has undergone a testing of steering gear and propulsion machinery in the previous twelve hours. The rules also
require that, whenever there is a hazardous condition on board a vessel, the port captain at the place of destination
and the place where the vessel is located have to be informed. Failure to comply with these requirements could result
in a civil penalty of  up to $25,000.

<H3>First Person</H3>

K S SOHN might not be the first person you meet when you visit the Seoul offices of P&amp;I Services of Korea (Pandiko). But you have at least a fifty per cent chance. The other first person you might meet is Sin-Young Kim, who has been assisting KS since August 1993 in the offices of Pandiko, the exclusive correspondent in Seoul for the London Club - and with whom he is pictured, right.
<IMG SRC="images/lcn2_4.gif" ALT="KS Sohn &amp; Sin-Young Kim" WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=122 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>
<P>
Pandiko was formed in 1981. KS, the representative director, has been there from the start. He graduated from Korea Maritime University at the end of 1973 and served as chief officer on a variety of vessels for Korea Shipping Corporation and Sanko Line. He came ashore in 1977 and worked as claims manager for KMTC, a long-time member of the London Club, before joining Pandiko. Making the most of his accumulated experience and knowledge, he was appointed an arbitrator by the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board in 1993.
<P>
Pandiko's role is to act as correspondent for all London Club members and to provide first-hand assistance to the membership. KS enjoys his work. The part he enjoys most is "evaluating shipowners' liabilities". This, and reporting generally to the club, keeps him very busy. He likes all sports and he enjoys playing golf. So pack your clubs the next time you're going to Seoul.

BILBROUGH'S tennis team rolled into action in August, taking on London law firm Holmes Hardingham. The match was
staged at the P&amp;O sports ground in leafy Worcester Park, Surrey, where the most difficult thing to negotiate was the
entrance to the ground, which was designed to be transited by nothing larger or less flexible than a small, coiled
spring. The team did us proud, pulling off a victory in a closely fought match. A thoroughly enjoyable afternoon's
tennis was followed by a barbecue supper, which not even all the wasps in Surrey could spoil.
<P>
The staff party at the Dicken's Inn, on Friday, September 29, had a pub theme. The yard of ale demonstration took
a minute and a half. Marcus Bucknall downed it in one minute. He is from Yorkshire. Gary Durham won the arm

<A NAME="Owners"></A><H3>Owners back call for limitation re-think</H3>

SHIPOWNERS across the globe are asking their P&amp;I Club managers to re-think the proposed International Group compromise on limitation of liability. And differences over the way in which clubs have approached the problem may lead to a fundamental shift in the relationship between shipowners, club boards and club managers.
<P>
John M Lyras, a member of the board of the Baltic Exchange and a leading shipowners' representative, says, "Shipowners will begin to question the way their clubs act. The strong protests from the Union of Greek Shipowners and the Greek Shipping Co-operation Committee show that too many owners were not consulted before this compromise was presented as a <I>fait accompli.</I>"
<P>
Apart from the powerful Greek owners' bodies in London and Piraeus, Swedish, Asian and European owners have voiced their concern. Robert Ho, managing director of Hong Kong-based Fairmont Shipping, has asked the Hong Kong Shipowners Association to protest at the speed with which the International Group clubs wish to implement the proposal. Ho wants more time for the Asian Shipowners Forum to consider the matter. And Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company has told its brokers it may seek alternatives to traditional P&amp;I Clubs unless it receives assurances that it will be protected from liabilities which could exceed $60m under the proposed regime.
<P>
Shipowners have taken unlimited cover under the P&amp;I system for granted. But Russell Peters, managing director of E&amp;F Lines, says not all owners realise the dangers in the mutual system today. "One owner's unlimited cover is another owner's unlimited liability," says Peters. Owners are still exposed to unlimited potential catastrophe claims, and John M Lyras says, "When shipowners are given sufficient time and information to consider this matter properly, they will show that they prefer a collectable limit on liability, one that will not break the back of world shipping."

<A NAME="Annual"></A><H3>Annual Report Highlights Strong Growth</H3>

THE London P&amp;I Club grew strongly in 1994/5. Assets were up five per cent to $355 million, and direct entered tonnage grew by ten per cent to 26.5 million gross tons. Russell Peters, chairman of the committee of the London Club, says, "It is most encouraging to note the significant increase in the Club's directly entered tonnage in the early months of 1995."
<P>
The annual report of the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, published today, shows how the growth has come despite a strict underwriting policy which meant that two hundred and forty potential members, with more than 650 vessels, were declined. During the year fleet replacement by members meant the average age of vessels entered in the club fell to sixteen years, two years below the world average age.
<P>
Financially, the Club had total assets at February 20th of $355 million, up five percent on the previous year, despite a poor investment climate. The supplementary call for the 1994/5 policy year was reduced to 30 per cent from 40 per cent. No further call is expected for that year.
<P>
A much improved claims experience helped the London Club figures. Peters says in the report that the improvement is in contrast to the experience of some other P&amp;I Clubs, and it reflects an improvement in the quality of the entered tonnage.

<A NAME="Investing"></A><H3>Investing in efficiency</H3>

The London Club has a new home. In a $5.2m investment move, the club has moved its managers into a 27,000 sq ft building in Leman Street. Financial director of A. Bilbrough, Bryan Gaze, says the move has already led to an improvement in staff morale and efficiency. "And with us as tenants, the building is already worth more than we paid for it, including the cost of fitting it out."
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/ldn_off.jpg" ALT="50 Leman Street" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=142 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=right>The move to 50 Leman Street (pictured right) at the end of May, was just in time for Bilbrough staff to get the benefit of the effective air conditioning as heatwaves struck London. The staff liked that, and like the space and facilities of the new office, which include a gymnasium. Club members like the economics of the move, and the benefits it will bring to the club as a whole.
<P>
"A subsidiary of the club bought the building for $3.72m as a shell," says Gaze. "It cost about another $1.5m to fit out, including furniture." That compares with about $12m for a similar building in Leadenhall Street, or $0.75m per year to continue renting the previous Leadenhall Street offices, which were less than half the size, hot, cramped, and in need of refurbishment. Gaze explains that the club managers had been seeking new premises for some time. "We had to make an urgent decision now," says Gaze, " as we saw the market drying up." The club committee saw the advantages of investing in a property now, and moved swiftly. "On top of the gain in staff morale and efficiency,  we have space to expand here," says Gaze. "We couldn't hire more staff before, there was no space. Here we have room to expand and we can support that with the  technological update we have made." 
<P>
Gaze estimates that the club has made a handsome capital gain, as the building is already worth about $7.5m. Also, the club is protected against rent rises on its manager's office. But money isn't everything. Location is important, and Leman Street is definitely on the unfashionable eastern fringe of the City area. "It is a rapidly improving area," says Gaze, and he can point to the rash of pubs, restaurants and wine bars opening in the streets around. Other big name shipping entities have buildings in the same area, and you have to pass the Sedgewick building to get to the nearest tube. David Bundock, company treasurer, says its takes him just over twenty minutes to walk from London Bridge rail station, across Tower Bridge. Does he like the building? "I love it," says Bundock. "It creates efficiency."

<A NAME="Scrap"></A><H3>Loss prevention</H3>

SCRAP metal can carry unexpected hazards, both for ships' crews and charterers. In a recent case, a vessel loaded scrap in Kaliningrad, Russia, for southern Europe. After loading, the master noticed a representative of  the shipper measuring nuclear radiation from the cargo. The master became alarmed when he saw increasing geiger-counter readings and informed his owners. They in turn insisted to the shipper and charterer that the entire cargo be unloaded again at Kaliningrad. 
<P>
According to Bremen-based Pandi Services, this is the only case of nuclear contaminated scrap that  they are aware of. However, Pandi says it should be strongly recommended that any owner or charterer who is to load scrap in a country where nuclear contamination is likely should begin monitoring prior to loading. 
<P>
Pandi says owners and charterers should protect themselves and their crews by employing an experienced expert with suitable and reliable instruments to measure possible radiation from the cargo. Monitoring should commence before loading and continue throughout the loading operation.
<P>
If masters suspect that the scrap is radioactive, they should stop loading and seek advice from the local club correspondents. If owners wish to load a scrap cargo which is known to be emitting radiation above ambient levels, then they should seek permission from the load and discharge port authorities, and inform their P&amp;I Club, as cover may be affected.

<A NAME="Malaysia"></A><H3>Malaysia cracks down </H3>

THE Malaysian government is cracking down on vessels dumping slops into its coastal waters. The level of policing of coastal waters has been increased since May, and nine vessels were denounced for alleged pollution offences in that month alone. One vessel was chased and fired on by a Malaysian Naval patrol vessel.
<P>
Government sources in Kuala Lumpur say they will establish a laboratory, to be staffed by foreign experts, which will have the sole task of fingerprinting oil samples taken from vessels alleged to have polluted the sea. A new agreement between the Malaysian armed forces, its police and its environment department is aimed at cutting response times to reported pollution incidents to less than one hour. Joint investigative teams will be on the scene and aboard the vessel to take samples. Local P&amp;I correspondent Spica Services warns owners that if vessels are detained in Malaysian waters, there will be delays and probably subsequent fines, in addition to adverse publicity in the regional press. 
<P>
Spica also says Malaysian Shipyard &amp; Engineering is to build a RM25m sludge reception facility. But until that comes along, vessels must either use Singapore's facilities, or exercise extreme care.

<H3>Brazil targets older bulkers</H3>

BULK carriers over eighteen years old must now have a full structural survey before they can load in Brazil. Two correspondents in Brazil, Pandibra, of Rio de Janeiro, and Proinde, of Santos, both warn that bulkers must now present themselves for loading five days in advance, and owners must contract an approved class surveyor to inspect the ship in accordance with the decree from the Director of Ports and Coasts. The class surveyor must be from an IACS society, but not the society which classes the vessel. In addition to examining the structure, and the vessel must be free of cargo to facilitate this, the surveyor will check that the vessel has valid P&amp;I cover with a recognised club.

<H3>Singapore acts on emergency plans</H3>

SINGAPORE'S marine department has taken a tough line on the need for ships to carry emergency plans for dealing with oil spills. The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990 came into force internationally in May this year. It requires all tankers over 150 gt and all other ships over 400 gt to carry a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP). The Marine Department in Singapore has reinforced that with a marine notice which says that current Oil Pollution Prevention Certificates, either International or issued by the Singapore marine department, will not be valid from April this year unless an approved SOPEP is carried.
<P>
The plans must include a national operational contact point for urgent reports on incidents involving harmful substances. For Singapore, the contact point is: Port Master, Port Master's department, Port of Singapore Authority. Tel: +65 274711 Ext 1166  Fax: +65 321 1777.

THE first person you meet when you visit the London Club <IMG SRC="images/lcn1_4.gif" ALT="Sonia" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=107 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=right>is not the chairman of the committee, nor the chairman of the managers. It is one of the two receptionists, Sonia Pascall (right) and Keely Goodge (left)<IMG SRC="images/lcn1_5.gif" ALT="Keeley" WIDTH=101 HEIGHT=109 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left>. They meet visitors and handle telephone calls from all over the world. Sonia, who is learning Russian and Italian as a hobby, says she loves meeting people, and likes the international feel of Bilbroughs. "And you get treated as a person here," says Sonia. "This isn't a yuppy company."
<P>

Sonia lives in Fulham, where she grows vegetables in her spare time. She says she is too independent to be married, and she joined Bilbroughs just one year ago, after temping for some time. Keely is even newer. She joined Bilbroughs six months ago, after a spell of travelling abroad. She worked in claims in an insurance company before joining Bilbroughs, and has her eye on a move up in the company. She also has her eye on a move into the tennis team, which she says is dominated by adjusters at present.

JULY was a busy social month for Bilbrough's London staff. Over one hundred and fifty guests enjoyed Singapore dim sum and drinks in the boardroom at a cocktail party held after the first committee meeting in the new building on July 5th. The air conditioning and the carpet both passed the test. Russell Peters paid the managers a compliment, and Graham Edmiston recalled some of the previous Bilbrough offices when thanking the 
committee for providing the new building.

The football team excelled itself at a tournament hosted by brokers Lloyd Thompson. Competing against twenty teams from other London-based P&amp;I clubs and firms of solicitors, Bilbroughs were knocked out in the semi-final after a penalty shoot out.

<H2><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica">Out of line on ship deviations</FONT></H2>
<P><MULTICOL COLS=3>
CLUB members are being exposed to the threat of major liabilities as a result of minor
deviations from cargo voyages.  
<P>
In some parts of the world it seems to be fairly widespread practice for owners to deviate into
local ports to change crews, embark repair gangs, take on stores, or perform other tasks. Some
members routinely declare such deviations to underwriters and pay the necessary additional
premiums. But there have been a number of deviations recently which have not been declared.
Although none of these has yet resulted in an adverse outcome, the consequences of such action
can be extremely serious.
<P>
It is well-understood that, without express authorisation, such deviations are in breach of bills
of lading and charter parties. It is often mistakenly  assumed, however, that delays will be so
minor as to be unnoticed or overlooked by cargo owners and charterers. Likewise, it is often
wrongly assumed that, if cargo interests claim for breach of contract, their loss will be minimal. 
What isn't appreciated is the fact that the law generally regards this type of breach 
as so serious that it results in the loss of the carrier's contractual defences and limits of liability.
<P>
If, for example, a vessel sinks with its cargo during even a brief deviation purely for the
convenience of the shipowner,  the ship will be liable in full for any cargo claims resulting from
the negligence of its employees.
<P>
Chances are that, in such a case, the member would  not be covered by its club at all, and would
have to face the claim uninsured.
<P>
The club can arrange market cover for loss of contractual defences resulting from deviation. The
cost of this depends on the value of the cargo.
<P>
Not all deviations represent a breach of the contract of carriage. But members are advised to
check with the club in cases where they are unsure of their legal position. 
<P>
The consequences of making the wrong judgement about what represents a contractual deviation
can be financially disastrous.

THE attention of the club has been drawn to a highly unusual procedure involving the  giving
of letters of undertaking in Venezuela.
<P>
In a recent incident, a small harbour tug sank at La Ceiba, Venezuela, while in the process of
helping a  23,000 gt bulk carrier to berth. The tug was one of two being used to help in the
berthing manoeuvre at the port, where vessels are required to berth stern-first to facilitate their
easy departure.
<P>
During the berthing manoeuvre, the tug working aft of the vessel sank onto its port side. The
bulk carrier was thereafter successfully berthed and proceeded to load a cargo of coal. 
<P><IMG SRC="images/slb4_2.jpg" ALT="Crane collapse" WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=181 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right></CENTER>
A crane was then brought in  to recover the sunken tug, but this proved to be woefully
inadequate, and subsequently collapsed, as can be seen from the photograph here. The tug and
the crane were eventually recovered, and the club then put up a letter of undertaking to allow the
bulk carrier to sail. 
<P>
Two months later, the vessel returned to the same port in Venezuela and was seized by the owner
of the tug, despite the fact that the club letter guaranteed payment on the usual terms.

<MULTICOL COLS=3>
ASBESTOSIS is an international problem for underwriters of liability insurance. 
<P>
The club has recently reached an out-of-court settlement in the sum of $110,000 with a
78-year-old  seaman employed as a donkeyman on board an Australian-flag vessel between 1971
and 1976.
<P>
The seaman was suffering from mesothelioma, allegedly contracted as a result of inhaling
asbestos dust and fibre while working on board the member's vessel.
<P>
Enquiries were made regarding ex-crew members of the vessel, but it transpired that most had 
died or were not traceable. One former crew member was found, however, who was able to
confirm the allegations made by the plaintiff regarding the conditions on board the vessel at the
time in question. Investigations showed that the plaintiff had been employed on various ships
owned by the member from 1952 until his retirement in 1978. He had also worked on the ships
of other companies for ten years before that, but was unwilling to proceed against them. Senior
counsel advised that the owner had no defence to the claim. 
<P>
The case illustrates the dilemma for insurers. Cause of action runs from the time the plaintiff
becomes aware of mesothelioma, for which the normal latency period is between 20 and 30
years.

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica">Santos sugar stoned</FONT></H3>

THE club's recent experience with shipments of bagged sugar originating from Santos in Brazil
has been anything but sweet. When it was called in to investigate reports of damage sustained
by a cargo of white sugar shipped from Santos to Aqaba, Jordan, the trail led clearly back to
Brazil.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/slb4_3.jpg" ALT="Stoned sugar" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=249 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=2 ALIGN=right></CENTER><P>
Prior to loading in Santos, the vessel's holds were inspected by the shippers of the sugar and were
found to be clean and dry. On arrival at Aqaba, however, it was noted that the cargo in 3,000
bags was badly caked/stoned. There was, though, no suggestion that the shipowner had failed
in any way to care for the cargo.
<P>
Chemical analysis subsequently showed that  the hardening of the sugar was due to the cargo
having a high moisture content prior to loading at Santos.
<P>
Sugar originating from Santos may be left exposed to the elements for long periods of time,
subject to deterioration as a result of moisture. Meanwhile, the problem for the master of the
vessel is that he can do little more than visually inspect the bags as they pass over the ship's rail.
<P>
Problems with bagged sugar at Santos tend to occur at the end of the season - towards the end
of the calendar year - due in part to the bags being stored one on top of the other for some time.
In this way, the bags at the bottom become heavily compressed. The situation is exacerbated by
the fact that storage is often in open-sided sheds, with the cargo exposed to potential damage by
rainwater. 
<P>
Members loading sugar at Santos are advised to take samples during pre-shipment surveys, and
to contact the club managers if they are in doubt about how to proceed.

<MULTICOL COLS=2 GUTTER=18>
THE Maritime Safety Agency in Tokyo has issued amendments to the law relating to the
prevention of marine pollution in Japan.
<P>
The MSA has introduced a release system for foreign-flag  vessels in cases of violation of the
law following marine pollution and maritime disasters. 
<P>
The changes mean that foreign-flag vessels which violate the law can now be released quickly,
once they have provided a suitable bond or acceptable letter of guarantee. The law has also been
amended to exclude imprisonment as a form of punishment for pollution offences, and the
maximum fine has been increased to ten million yen.
<P>
<LI>Some good news on pollution, meanwhile, comes from the US. Markos Zampelis, master of the Mare Queen, has been commended by the US Coast Guard for his quick and decisive action
after his vessel was in collision with the Morrerro in March this year at Houston. The
coast-guard says Capt Zampelis's decision to gravitate cargo from his vessel was "in keeping
with OPA 90, and an example to all of what responsible action should be."

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica">Spanner in the works</FONT></H3>

A NUMBER of instances of cargo being damaged by ballast water overflowing from
double-bottom tanks via unfastened manhole covers have come to the attention of the club
managers in recent months.
<P><IMG SRC="images/slb4_4.jpg" ALT="Manhole cover" WIDTH=230 HEIGHT=213 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 BORDER=2 ALIGN=left><P>
It seems that one of the main reasons that manhole covers remain unfastened is the absence of
a properly implemented safety system. And, too often, it comes down to not having a spanner
handy to do the job properly. 
<P>
A spanner is used to unfasten the nuts on the manhole cover, and is then taken back to the
engineroom, or the bosun's store, or wherever. This stems from a desire - commendable in itself
- not to leave spanners lying around on the double bottom tank plating while the space is being
inspected or while repairs of some sort are being undertaken.
<P>
When it is time to replace the cover, the person sent to retrieve  the spanner gets distracted, and
forgets about his task. The end result is that the manhole cover gets replaced, and the nuts
tightened by hand. The cover then appears to be secure, but leaks nevertheless occur when the
tank is next ballasted and the head raised above the tanktop, or when ballast starts surging in the
tank.
<P>
Members are reminded that the removal/replacement of manhole covers comes under the
auspices of tank entry procedures. Check lists should be available on board all ships, and
members are urged to make sure that these lists are closely observed on all their vessels. Failure
to do so may result in costly claims for the club.

THE club was recently involved in a dispute in connection with a bulk cargo damaged as a result of seawater ingress during the ocean passage. 
<P>
The cargo was loaded in China, during periods of rain. The shippers assured the master that all
wet cargo was being removed and that only sound cargo was being loaded. Unfortunately, most
of the cargo was loaded in a damp condition, but this was not apparent on observation.
<P>
During the ocean voyage, a  small amount of seawater did leak into the cargo. As a result of the
damp condition of the cargo,  the cargo receivers were able to mount an argument to suggest that
there had been extensive seawater ingress.
<P>
Members are reminded that, even where there is a suspicion that wet cargo is being loaded,
mates' receipts and bills of lading should be claused. 
<P>
Alternatively, the club correspondent should be called in for advice.

<H3>Asbestos ruling</H3>

ASBESTOS is one of the least popular words in the insurance lexicon. And a recent dispute
before the courts in Dublin says a lot about the nature of the burden of proof required
in asbestos-related claims.
<P>
Eight crew members of a ro-ro passenger ferry entered with the club claimed  damages resulting
from exposure to asbestos dust. The vessel's shell plating had been holed during a routine
docking operation, in the process exposing brown asbestos insulation behind the panels to some
of the cabins.
<P>
The vessel continued to operate while the repairs - which involved moving the debris and
asbestos through the alleyways and across the cardeck  of the ship - were being carried out. The crew members said no screens were erected to contain dust emissions blown  throughout the
vessel. 
<P>
The trial went ahead, the plaintiff being the first-listed crew member. It was claimed that the crew members were suffering from trauma, severe upset, anxiety and distress arising from the risk of developing asbestosis, mesothelioma or lung cancer. The court found in favour of the crew member, holding that health and safety regulations had been breached because the crew had not been adequately informed that asbestos was being removed from the vessel. The crew member
was awarded IEP35,900, made up of IEP10,000 for any future medical expenses, IEP900 for medical
expenses up to the trial, and IEP25,000 for general damages. Senior counsel also recommended
that out-of-court settlements, totalling IEP226,145, be made to the seven other crew members.

<H3>Unusual salvage</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/slb3_1.jpg" ALT="Poseidon Express" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=173 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left>WHEN loss prevention doesn't work, the stage is set for those who can minimise the damage and
arrive at the best solution for all parties involved. Such was the case in May this year when the 7,824 gt passenger ferry <EM>Poseidon Express</EM> capsized on her side, obstructing the entrance to two of four berths serving the small Greek island harbour of Paros. Paros is a popular tourist
destination, and the club moved quickly to get the harbour working again before the start of the
summer season. It opted for a fixed-price, no-cure-no-pay bid from Greek salvage expert
Tsavliris which involved the innovative method of sealing the vessel's garage, pumping it out,
and using the ship's own positive stability to roll her upright on the berth. 
<P>
Seventy-five men worked round the clock on the operation, which should be completed a month
before demand for berth space exceeds present capacity. 
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Galley proof</H3>

A RECENT settlement agreed by the club in the US illustrates the weight given to a judge's
impressions of written evidence at the start of a personal injury trial.
<P>
A 53-year-old chief steward alleged that he had suffered serious injuries to his back and left
shoulder as a result of a fall sustained while cleaning a grease collection system in the galley of a vessel operated by a London Club member. The steward claimed the handle of the system
struck him behind and below the left ear, causing him to fall to the deck from the chair on which he was standing. At the time, the steward complained of injuries to his left ankle, foot and arm, and he experienced numbness to his back and left shoulder. He took three days' rest. Two months later he visited a clinic in New Orleans, where he received physiotherapy and ultrasound treatment. He was released as fit for duty and returned to the ship for one week, before being routinely paid off. He then received treatment at home for a month.                 <P>                   
He found a berth on another ship but was knocked down by a car - sustaining head, back and
knee injuries - before he could take it up. He was then off work for six months before being
examined by a seaman's union doctor, who found him fit for duty, noting an absence of any
complaint of injury since the man's previous routine medical, despite the intervening  galley fall and subsequent traffic accident. Sixteen months later, the steward underwent back surgery. He was unable to return to work after that.
<P>
Medical experts retained by the club felt that the steward was suffering from a disc disease which predated the fall. The judge disagreed. Trial was called at short notice and, just as it started, the judge said he felt the injuries probably resulted from the shipboard accident, and that the $650,000 settlement sought by the steward was reasonable. The owner had offered $50,000. Settlement was agreed at $425,000. The risks associated with continuing with the trial were deemed to be too great. Only in America...

<H3>The truth about stowaways </H3>
<IMG SRC="images/slb3_4.jpg" ALT="Stowaway" WIDTH=138 HEIGHT=139 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left>THIS man is a Latvian. Or he could be an Azabajanian. Or just possibly a Ukrainian. He was, in
any event, a stowaway found on board a vessel operated by a London Club member which was
going to the United States. The man claimed  political asylum in the US, but it was denied. The club's problems really began when it tried to repatriate him. He was eventually returned to Latvia, at the third attempt, but he made it difficult. He insisted  that he wasn't a Latvian, and thereafter worked his way through most of the former Soviet states, claiming them as his birthplace. He applied for Israeli citizenship and he claimed various religions and said he would rather die in a US prison than be sent home.
<P>
It is, like most incidents involving stowaways, a sad story. And it illustrates one of the main
problems for shipowners and for the club - stowaways, not surprisingly, rarely tell the truth about themselves. It is important to get as much information from stowaways as possible, as ninety per cent of stowaways have no identity documents on them when found on board a ship. 
<P>
Masters should inform the owner and/or the club as soon as stowaways are discovered on board.
Stowaways should be kept separate from the crew, and not put to work on board ship. And
stowaways should be humanely looked after. All this is sound advice, if easier said than done.
But the best advice of all is to take every possible precaution to make sure that stowaways are detected before the ship leaves port. An inspection list of accessible spaces can be beneficial. Be prudent, and watchful, at all times. The alternative is a great deal of trouble and expense for all concerned.
<P>
<LI>Authorities in Spain are cracking down on stowaways following a big increase in the number
of people entering the country illegally by sea. If there is any evidence to show that masters and crew have been negligent in connection with stowaways, fines of up to Ptas25m may be imposed. Masters are advised to notify the Spanish authorities and their local agent of the existence of stowaways before their ship enters the country.

<H3>Boxes and bags</H3>
<IMG SRC="images/slb3_5.jpg" ALT="Containers" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=111 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left>THE US Court of  Appeals has handed down an important COGSA decision. Four and a half
million plastic bags were shipped in a  sealed container from Korea to New York. The bill of
lading was claused "Shipper's Load and Count". The container was discharged with the seal in
place, but a shortage was noted at the consignee's yard. 
<P>
The appeal court affirmed the district court's earlier decision, holding that this was not a clean bill, and that the carrier was therefore not bound by the stated number of plastic bags within the sealed container. The carrier had a defence because the bills of lading contained limiting language and the number of bags could not be verified by the carrier. The court did warn, though, that the limiting language doesn't help an ocean  carrier if the shipment is easily verifiable.

<H3>Yes we have no bananas</H3>
WHAT does a shipowner do when it has 127,355 boxes of bananas on board, in a fiendishly hot
part of the world, and the vessel's  machinery breaks down, with not a hope in hell of getting the fruit to the discharge port before it turns to mush?
<P>
In the case of one London Club member recently, the answer was to give the bananas away to the
local population. The vessel had loaded a full cargo of bananas in Ecuador, and it became
necessary to make a quick decision what to do with the fruit when it became clear that the
vessel's reefer machinery could not be repaired in time.  
<P>
There was no prospect of carrying the bananas, valued at about $2m, to final destination in
Europe and getting them there in an edible state. 
<P>
Having looked at all the commercially expedient and acceptable options, the owner decided to
donate the bananas to the people of Ecuador, while they were still fit for consumption. So the
vessel berthed alongside at Guayaquil, opened its holds, and told the locals to help themselves.
<P>
Coincidentally, a local election was taking place at the time, and one of the candidates did
consider using the bananas as a vote-getter. This would have been one of the few occasions in
political history when an election was won by a long, thin yellow fruit, although there are other recorded incidents of thick skins helping to win votes.

<H3>US connection</H3>

A PAKISTANI seaman employed by a Chilean shipowner through a Hong Kong crewing agency on board a vessel flying
the Liberian flag is injured in Ecuador. Question. Where does the seaman sue for damages, three years after the event?
Answer. Texas. 
<P>
The London Club recently dealt with just such a case, and it is indicative of a trend whereby an increasing number
of Far Eastern seamen - particularly Filipinos and Koreans - are suing shipowners in the US courts. This is happening
despite the seamen having been paid the full contractual benefits to which they are entitled under the laws of their
own country.
<P>
Texas, together with Louisiana and Florida, has very liberal laws and is unlikely to throw out a case for mere lack of
jurisdiction simply because there is little or no contact with the state. The club was able to have the action involving
the Pakistani seaman - who was paid his contractual entitlement - dismissed on technical grounds. And before the
seaman could refile, he was time-barred.
<P>
As a general rule, if the ship regularly trades to a port in a particular state in the US, a  seaman - irrespective of
nationality - stands a good chance of successfully being able to sue the shipowner there. Owners should avoid sending
sick or injured seamen to the US for hospital treatment unless it is absolutely essential. Members should contact the
club managers for advice if they are in any doubt. US law may be reformed to prevent certain foreign claimants from
suing there, but it is too early to say whether Congress will pass the necessary legislation.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

<H3>Quay contact</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/slb2_1.jpg" ALT="Smashed wall" WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=159 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left>OUR picture shows a sorry-looking  quay wall in  Abidjan, Ivory Coast, after a member's vessel came into contact with
it earlier this year. The vessel was intending to make a tug-assisted turn to starboard in order to berth portside-to.
The pilot called too late for the starboard anchor to be dropped, but it was apparently stuck. The master ordered
full astern but failed to stop the vessel from hitting the concrete quay at an angle of ninety degrees. In his report
of the incident, the master, with no obvious attempt at irony, noted that there was "not much damage to the ship".
He was not wrong. Meanwhile, damage to the pier is thought to be in the region of $50,000. The incident, and others
like it around the world, emphasise the need for masters to override pilots where they consider it justified.      
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Snags for ships in the Mississippi </H3>

THE Mississippi River in the United States, in common with rivers all over the world, is crisscrossed with numerous
pipelines and telephone cables. Not all these pipelines are required to be buried under the seabed, and even those
which are may become exposed due to erosion.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/slb2_2.gif" ALT="US river map" WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=170 ALIGN=right>The consequences of snagging a pipeline or telephone cable with the ship's anchor can be  horrendous. Oil pollution,
loss of electricity to hospitals, and loss of phone communications are just a few examples of the sorts of things which
can happen.
<P>
Fortunately, such occurrences are few and far between. Should an innocent vessel even be accused of fouling a
pipeline or cable, however, the costs involved in simply inspecting for damage can be extremely high.
<P>
The managers of the London Club have recently handled two cases where damage was suspected on vessels in the
Mississippi. In one case, the master anchored in fog near a telephone cable. In the second case, the vessel's anchor
was found to have dragged into an area of pipelines. In each instance, the United States Coast Guard insisted that
the anchors be slipped before the vessel was allowed to sail.
<P>
Although no damage was found in either case, the cost of marking the anchor, retrieval and sonar survey outgoings,
together with associated legal costs, had to be borne by the shipowner.
<P>
The cost of a sonar survey is in the region of $20,000 per pipeline. A so-called 'pigging' operation - involving
under-water inspection of a pipeline - costs about $100,000.
<P>
Areas of pipeline are shown on maps or charts such as the United States Department of Commerce one shown here.
But owners are advised that, during passage planning, such areas should be highlighted and brought to the attention
of the officer on watch.

Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all
submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their
draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys."</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3>Watching Brief</H3>
THE club has been greatly encouraged by the response to the first issue of its StopLoss Bulletin. Its Claims Review
Body continues to monitor all live claims where the total estimated cost has altered by more than $100,000 during
the period under review. Meanwhile, Derek Avenall and his colleagues will be happy to answer any queries on +44 (0)171 772 8015.

<H3>Bunker watch</H3>
<P>
IN today's highly competitive shipping industry, where owners and charterers alike are under pressure to contain
costs, and where refineries are practised at finding more and more uses for petroleum residues, bunker quality is the
subject of some concern.
<P>
The club has seen an increase in bunkering disputes centred mainly in - but not limited to - areas such as Singapore
and Rotterdam. It has been very difficult to prove the origin of deficient bunkers and of the physical damage they
cause to the ship's machinery. So what can be done to protect owners?

<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/slb2_3.jpg" ALT="Singapore Harbour" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=224> <BR><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Singapore -  the club has seen an increase in bunkering disputes here and in other major centres</FONT></I></CENTER></TD>
<TD>There are three main problems:
(a) Basic bunker quality deficiency.  (b) Introduction of foreign elements to increase quantity, at the expense of
quality. (c) Unfit fuel on board the vessel despite receipt of satisfactory samples from the bunker barge - a common
predicament for owners operating under voyage charters.
<P>
There are a number of loss prevention measures which can be adopted to reduce the likelihood of bunker quality
disputes arising. Analysing samples during bunkering operations is expensive and may not be completed quickly enough
to prevent machinery damage. But the chances of recovering any loss will be greatly increased if attention is paid
to avoiding adverse contractual terms, if bunker specifications are clearly stated, and if representative samples are
preserved.
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
In order to support analytical evidence, samples have to be representative of bunkers originating from the barge, and
from the barge only. A proper representative sample can be obtained by means of drip-feed sampling systems
attached to the ship's manifold. Samples should be collected in clean bottles, sealed after use to establish integrity. 
<P>
Samples - certified by the bunker supplier if possible - should be taken after every bunkering and kept on board
until such time as it is clear that no dispute is going to arise.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Arrest alert</H3>

THERE is currently a spate of unwarranted and indiscriminate arrests of foreign vessels entering Nigerian territorial
waters. Vessels engaged on legitimate business are being arrested on the basis of flimsy excuses or claims. Owners are
obliged to arrange bonds to release the vessel - no easy matter in Nigeria.
<P>
Dealing with these arrests is time-consuming and costly. Claims - often spurious and grossly exaggerated at best - 
can take five years to get before the Nigerian courts.
<P>
Impey &amp; Coker, the club's correspondent in Lagos, tells us that, under new guidelines issued by the Federal High Court
in Nigeria, a caveat can be filed in the court register against unwarranted arrests of foreign vessels. One effect of this
is that, while application to arrest is sought, the vessel will be allowed to leave Nigerian waters. Later, should it
become necessary to secure a bond, it can be done within a more sensible timeframe than was possible before.
<P>
Impey &amp; Coker suggests that it should be notified each time a vessel entered with the club is going to Nigeria. It will
then file a caveat so that the vessel will not be exposed to the risk of immediate arrest.

<H3>No glossing over customs fines</H3>
<P>
MISDECLARATION of stores can lead to some very heavy fines being brought against members, the severity and fairness
of which can vary from one jurisdiction to another.
<P>
The club is currently disputing a fine in excess of $100,000 which has been levied by customs authorities in Argentina
in connection with  paint stores carried on board a member's vessel. As a result of a double entry, the amount of
paint on board was declared wrongly.
<P>
In Argentina, customs declarations are taken very seriously, so seriously in fact that owners are obliged to appoint
a customs agent solely for the purpose of lodging the customs declaration with the Customs House.
<P>
The customs agent may be appointed on owner's behalf by the charterer, but owners must remember that the
completion of the customs declaration is the master's - and therefore the owner's - responsibility. The result of any
misdeclaration can be a confiscation of any stores which have been overstated, and a fine of up to five times their
value.
<P>
Fines are also imposed for stores undeclared, as the customs authorities are concerned that stores are being sold
ashore, with no taxes being paid.
<P>
English versions of the official customs forms are available, and masters should ask for a copy to ensure that they fully understand what is required.

<H3>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</H3>
THIS is the first issue of a new publication from the London Club. So why have we decided to do it? 
<P>
At different times
in the shipping and insurance cycles, emphasis is placed on one particular aspect of P&amp;I - be it claims, or underwriting, or investment or any one of a number of other factors. But there is one constant in all this, one fundamental aspect of the business which we should never lose sight of - prevention is better than cure. 
<P>
In our StopLoss Bulletin, we will regularly draw attention to  significant causes of claims which are brought to our notice.
<P>
By judiciously opening our claims files, we hope to thin them down a little, for the common good.

<H3>Fishmeal problems heat up</H3>

FISHMEAL is a fairly innocuous looking cargo. But it is not to be taken lightly, as the club's experience shows. 
<P>
Overheating fishmeal is not a new phenomenon. The club has handled a number of claims, most originating in South America.
<P>
All the clubs have been working to eliminate the problems for a number of years. Properly treated, fishmeal can be carried safely. But it is a very volatile cargo, and calls for great care on the part of those who contract to move it. Constant vigilance is required  to monitor the condition of cargo while it is on board the vessel. 
<TABLE Width=90%>

</TD><TD>
A case currently being handled by the club illustrates some of the difficulties. A vessel loaded fishmeal in South America, for carriage to the Philippines and Indonesia. While it was approaching Suva, Fiji, smoke was seen coming from
one of the holds. At Suva, the hold was flooded with carbon dioxide to smother the overheating fishmeal. The cargo
continued to overheat during passage to Indonesia. In fact the overheating became so severe that experts from Hong
Kong were required  to attend the vessel throughout discharge at Manila, and to remain on board for subsequent
discharge in Indonesia.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
There was frenzied activity throughout discharge aimed at thwarting the overheating. Some was fantastically complex,
and expensive. 
The final bill has yet to come in, but it is unlikely to be small. The lesson for all members carrying fishmeal must
be to follow the IMO guidelines as closely as possible and to monitor temperatures throughout the voyage. And
remember. Have plenty of CO<SUB>2</SUB> on board.

<H3>Hot spots for DRI pellets</H3>

DIRECT reduced iron pellets are used extensively in the steel-making industry. They  are also a product which the
claims handlers in a number of P&amp;I clubs have become very familiar with over the last twenty years. 
<P>
Shipping DRI pellets in a well-found vessel, in optimum conditions, demands great care on the part of the carrier.
But factor in, for example, a minor defect in the carrying vessel, and you have a graphic example of what an
unforgiving and highly dangerous cargo this can be.
<P>
A vessel entered with the club loaded a cargo of DRI pellets at Murmansk in April 1993 for carriage to New Orleans. 
Whilst enroute it was found that there was a hot spot of about 200 degrees centigrade in the cargo in No 3 hold. It
was decided to divert to Southampton in the UK as a port of refuge. The hold was opened, in the presence of the
Southampton Fire Brigade. 
Upon inspection, it was decided that the cargo should be discharged into trucks and stored at a nearby site
designated by the port authority.

<TD>After about 2,000 tons had been discharged from the hold, it was found that the temperature of the remaining cargo
had reached 500 degrees centigrade. 
<P>
There was a risk that the heating would spread by conduction through the bulkheads to the cargo in adjacent holds,
so it was decided to flood the hold.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE><TR>
<TD>Eight fire tenders and a tug set about the task. About 4,760 tons of heat- and water-damaged cargo was eventually
discharged ashore. The vessel then resumed its voyage to New Orleans, and there completed discharge of the balance
of its cargo without problems.</TD>

</TABLE>
A subsequent investigation by experts appointed by the club revealed a defect in the
vessel's hatchcovers coinciding with the point at which the heating of the cargo had apparently first started. 
DRI pellets are very reactive to seawater, and it is likely that a fire will start if even very small amounts of seawater
are shipped into a hold.
<P>
On the advice of counsel, the club decided not to contest the allegation of cargo interests that the vessel was
unseaworthy at the start of the voyage. A settlement of about $375,000 has now been agreed. 
<P>
The club is continuing to monitor experience relating to shipments of this cargo. But, to date, it is not persuaded
that there is any truly safe way to carry DRI pellets other than under nitrogen, or inert gas, as provided for in the
IMO Bulk Cargoes Code.  
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<BR>
<H3>Wrist watch</H3>

SMALL wonder the P&amp;I clubs are ever watchful when it comes to personal injury claims in the US.
Earlier this year, a Peruvian seamen fell and broke his wrist in the engineroom of a member's vessel. Although he was
in some pain, and although his wrist was swollen, he did not seem to be in any real distress.
<P>
When the ship berthed at New York, the seaman went to a local hospital, where his sister worked as a nurse. The
hospital fixed what turned out to be a rather awkward fracture . 
<P>
But the hospital wasn't the only place visited by the seaman. He went to see a lawyer who, working on a contingency
fee basis, agreed to represent him in a possible action against the shipowner. The club, meanwhile, instructed a New
York attorney to advise the shipowner.
<P>
There were a number of issues to be resolved, including the payment of medical bills and the non-payment of the
seaman's wages. There had been no intention on the part of the owner not to pay the seaman's wages, but there was
a strong possibility that the US courts might have seen things differently. In addition, US law provides for a penalty
of double the outstanding wage due for each day the wages remain unpaid.
<P>
Faced with these difficulties, and with some uncertainty about the long-term effects of the injury, the club has just
settled the claim for $100,000.

THIS is not a photograph of a ship nestling against a Yokohama fender. It is a picture of  a member's containership
which, in September 1995, was informed by a tugboat pilot during a berthing manoeuvre at Marseilles Fos that
it had a "big fish" on its bow. The big fish turned out to be a dead 30 tonne whale which had attached itself to the
vessel's bulbous bow. Subsequent investigation showed that the vessel had most likely picked up the 18 m-long whale
in the harbour area and not at sea, since the ship's speed  during the sea passage had increased, rather than fallen
off. On the instructions of the Marseilles port authority, the whale was towed out to sea by the French navy and
destroyed by explosives. The cost of the operation is not yet known, although  a private contractor first offered to
do the job for Ffr 105,000. Herman Melville would not have approved.</TD>

FORTY-five per cent of the cargoworthiness recommendations to emerge from the club's 1994/95 ship inspection
programme related to hatchcovers, up from 41 per cent the previous year. Deficiencies were found to almost 36 per cent of
all ships inspected, but this increased to 46 per cent of all ships with hatchcovers. This graph shows the most
common problems involving hatchcovers.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

<H3>Untimely end</H3>

A thirty-eight-year-old engineer working on board a member's ship died recently, of natural causes, while his vessel
was at anchor off an Indian port. When the man first reported sick, with a temperature of 104,  he was given
antibiotics and pain-killers for suspected flu symptoms. The next day, although still weak and lacking in appetite,
he improved to the extent that he was able to stand part of his engineroom watch. The following day, however, he
complained once more of feeling unwell. The third mate was unable to match his symptoms with any condition listed
in the ship's medical library.
<P>
Tragically, the man was found slumped unconscious in his shower the next day. He was later taken ashore and
pronounced dead.
<P>
It was established that the most likely cause of death was viral myocarditis, a condition which could have been
treated by the prompt application of appropriate drugs and medication.
<P>
In fact, no qualified emergency medical assistance  had been summoned before all signs of life were lost. The master
and crew would not have been expected to have displayed the effectiveness of a physician, but they would have been
judged by what would have been expected of reasonable people with their training and in their position.
<P>
In view of the possibility that the owner could have been found negligent for not seeking qualified medical help
earlier, and the likely unsympathetic interpretation placed by a federal court on the failure to get such help to the
ship earlier, the claim has recently been settled for $1.6m.
<P>
The lesson for shipowners is that they must always look after their crews, especially since they are sometimes too
ill to look after themselves.

<H3>Rating The Mutuals - A Club Perspective</H3> 

<B>By Bryan Gaze</B>
<P>
In recent years, assessment of the various entities that make up the P&amp;I industry has become increasingly important. The amounts of money involved are substantial, and most P&amp;I clubs experienced considerable supplementary call volatility in the late 1980's and/or early 1990's. In addition, the well-publicised problems at Lloyd's, and the failure of several insurance companies, led to questions being asked about the relative strengths of enterprises in the P&amp;I field.
<P>
Those interested in the results of such assessments include shipowners and their brokers, bankers, port and other controlling authorities. Most of the P&amp;I industry is made up of mutual organisations, and most of those are members of the International Group. It follows therefore that any assessment of the industry will have to concentrate on the mutual sector. Its unusual characteristics, which are discussed below, make analysis difficult, and may frustrate attempts to rate the mutuals objectively.
<P>
Although several brokers had produced, and continue to produce, quite comprehensive annual reviews of the P&amp;I clubs, these reviews made no attempt at rating. Interested bankers also produce their own analyses, but again without rating.
<P>
Nevertheless, the need for objective assessment led the rating agency, Standard &amp; Poors' (S&amp;P), to publish its 1994 Marine Mutual Report, which has been followed by similar reports in 1995 and 1996. 
<P>
S&amp;P stated in its 1994 Report: "In a departure from normal S&amp;P practices, S&amp;P ranks most of the clubs based on assessments of relative strength, compared with S&amp;P's more normal use of assessments to indicate an opinion of absolute financial strength". 
<P>
S&amp;P identified several areas which it found difficult to analyse, and it may be that the difficulty of analysis caused S&amp;P to adopt its "relative strength" approach. Certainly the unusual characteristics of the clubs, which were summarised by S&amp;P in that report, make a daunting list:     
<OL>
<LI> Lack of paid up capital, profits, and shareholders' funds.
<LI> Difficulty in assessing the strength resulting from "free reserves".
<LI> Lack of consistent information about underwriting year results. 
<LI> Inconsistent accounting treatment of supplementary calls.
<LI> Difficulty in assessing reserving practices, including IBNRs. 
<LI> Difficulty in analysing loss ratios due to volatility of calls. 
<LI> Difficulty in assessing the underlying financial strength of shipowner members. 
</OL>
<P>
It is interesting to consider whether S&amp;P's ratings are as meaningful and authoritative as possible, but first, each of these characteristics needs to be examined in the light of present circumstances:
<P>

<H5>1. Lack of paid up capital, profits, and shareholders' funds.</H5>

This point is incontrovertible - there are no shareholders or profits. However genuinely free reserves are analogous to shareholders' funds, and could be considered to be the clubs' capital. 
<P>
<H5>2. Difficulty in assessing the strength resulting from "free reserves".</H5>

The criteria to be considered would include: - the pattern of growth of those reserves;
- clubs' stated intentions as to the circumstances under which they may be used; 
- the ratios of free reserves to total assets; liabilities; annual call income, etc.
<P>
Considerable volatility was experienced in the late 1980's or early 1990's, with most clubs having had to levy unexpectedly high supplementary calls. That volatility could reappear, but most clubs have now taken steps to build up significant reserves so that only in an exceptionally expensive year would extra supplementary calls be needed.
<P>
<H5>3. Lack of consistent information about underwriting year results.</H5>

Detailed information is now available for most clubs. In addition, although the basis of accounting may vary, the requirements of the EU Insurance Accounts Directive, which are now mandatory for British insurance companies, should lead to even greater disclosure. It should now be possible to obtain adequate comparison of clubs' policy year results, and deteriorations.
<P>
<H5>4. Inconsistent accounting treatment of supplementary calls.</H5>

Supplementary calls which have been authorised but not levied at balance sheet dates are treated in varying ways by different clubs. However, sufficient information should now be available for adequate analysis to be made.
<P>
<H5>5. Difficulty in assessing reserving practices, including IBNRs.</H5>

Unfortunately, it is still not possible to obtain enough information for reliable comparison to be made. All clubs, however, have become aware of the need for early and adequate estimating of individual outstanding claims, and it should not be too long, therefore, before all clubs publish this information on a Policy Year basis. Many clubs now use consulting actuaries to project Incurred But Not Reported claims (IBNRs), together with actuarial forecasting techniques, and again it must be hoped that this information will soon be explicitly published.
<P>
S&amp;P has done great service in this regard, as it has requested that clubs provide information regarding the amount of IBNRs included in their total outstanding claims estimates, and most clubs consider it is in their interest to co-operate with S&amp;P, which therefore should have the beginnings of a powerful additional database. 
<P>
<H5>6. Difficulty in analysing loss ratios due to volatility of calls.</H5>

This point may be less relevant now than it was when S&amp;P prepared its first report.
<P>
<H5>7. Difficulty in assessing the underlying financial strength of shipowner members.</H5>

It is impossible to evaluate accurately the underlying "capital" of the clubs, but it should always be borne in mind that clubs have formidable legal powers to make extra calls on their members if required. This factor, more than any other, provides assurance to those concerned with all aspects of shipping, that clubs are financially extremely sound organisations.
<P>
S&amp;P has made a major contribution to the subject of assessment of clubs, and its reports are most valuable. However, it seems rather unfortunate that S&amp;P has found it necessary to prepare relative, rather than absolute, rankings. S&amp;P states, under the `flag' system it adopts, that clubs have financial characteristics which suggest a lesser (three flags), average (two flags), or greater (one flag) expected need to rely on unforecast supplementary funding from members to meet claims.
<P>
As noted above, most clubs are now maintaining, and increasing, reserve funds, and are therefore unlikely to suffer from unexpected fluctuations in supplementary calls except in years which are abnormally claims-heavy. The `average expected need to rely on unforecast supplementary funding from members to meet claims' is therefore very low, and the relative ratings are less useful as a consequence. 
<P>
Absolute ratings, on the other hand, would be much more useful. Financially interested parties would find it easier to assess the mutuals, and clubs could all aspire to the highest rating, which, if achievable, would be of great benefit to the whole of the shipping and related industries. By definition, whilst `average' criteria are adopted, this cannot be possible. The progress made in respect of most of the special characteristics listed above means that absolute ratings must now be a realistic proposition.

<H3>The P&amp;I Industry today
</H3> 
<B>by Graham Edmiston, chairman, A Bilbrough &amp; Co, managers of the London P&amp;I Club
</B>
<P>
THE P&amp;I industry is facing up to change. It is a long-established, respected and vital part of shipping, but it has, until now, been a low-key and often misunderstood  sector of the industry. Today the P&amp;I clubs are changing internally to become more responsive to the needs of the shipowners who are the club members, and changing  externally as they need to fight more vociferously and openly for their interests. Inevitably, this puts the spotlight on P&amp;I as a whole, and that light has shown up some divisions in what was traditionally a united front put up by the club managers. But the fundamentals have not changed.
<P>
P&amp;I is big business. About ninety per cent of the world's ocean-going merchant fleet, over 400m gt, is entered in the fourteen protection and indemnity clubs which make up the International Group. Together, the group clubs' annual premium income is about $1.7bn, and they hold assets of about $4bn.
<P>
The clubs insure shipowners on a mutual basis against third party liabilities. But they do more. They also protect shipowners' interests generally. They provide security by way of club undertakings if needed to get a member's ship released from arrest, they handle and defend claims against shipowners with the help of  a worldwide network of correspondents, lawyers, surveyors and technical experts. And they are taking an increasingly high profile role in representing shipowners' interests in international organisations such as IMO, Intertanko, The ICS, BIMCO and the CMI. 
<P>
Many of the senior club managers are lawyers and they are relied upon as legitimate, respected and authoritative spokesmen for shipowners at international conferences. Club managers have a strong professional ethos and they have rightfully earned the respect of the shipping community over many years.
<P>
Clubs are not simply insurers. They work to help shipping generally. They are currently active in analysing the causes of  marine casualties and claims. Since over sixty per cent of major claims on the clubs are attributed to human error, they are also taking an increasing interest in the manning of ships. Using this analysis, and their experience of what can go wrong, the clubs are promoting loss prevention polices, and have put their weight behind the ISM Code, which is intended to strengthen the management of ships.
<P>
The clubs are at the forefront of efforts by the world's marine insurance industry to improve maintenance, manning and operational standards ashore and afloat. Their own programmes of ship inspections anc condition surveys are an important part of international efforts to eliminate sub-standard ships.
<P>
Most of the group clubs were formed in the nineteenth century. There are nine British managed clubs, three in Scandinavia and one each in America and Japan. A  strong family tradition runs through club management, with families such as the Rileys, the Millers, the Holmans and the Poulssons having been involved for more than a century. Club managers are part of a proud tradition and managers take a very paternalistic and protective attitude towards their members.
<P>
That may change slightly as today's shipowners are less willing to take for granted that the clubs  will always be right. It came as a surprise to the shipping community when differences between club managers and club boards over the issue of the introduction of a limit on P&amp;I cover spilled over into the press during 1995. Cover was traditionally unlimited, but many shipowners feel that this is too risky a position to continue. A majority of the clubs forced the group to adopt the so-called "twenty per cent compromise", which introduces a notional overall limit on club cover of about $20bn. In practical terms this preserves unlimited cover, and of course, unlimited risk. That will stand for the 1996 policy year, but several clubs have now sent questionnaires to their members on the issue and it appears that an overwhelming majority of shipowners are in favour of a lower limit. We expect to see a more realistic limit within the next two years.
<P>
The Greek shipping community has relied heavily on the services of club managers and individual owners have shown great loyalty to their chosen clubs. Today Greek owners are part of the movement of change within the clubs, and are playing an increasingly prominent role in the direction of club policy. Miles Kulukundis was the last chairman of the UK Club, John M Lyras is current chairman of the London Club  and these two clubs, which have the largest Greek membership, and the West of England Club, all have Greek vice-chairmen. These three clubs also have offices in Greece.
<P>
There have been times when Greek owners have opposed International Group policy, and Greek owners' associations are taking an active role in the debate over limitation on cover. But overall, the relationship between the Greek shipping community and the International Group P&amp;I clubs has been close and harmonious. Change will come, but that relationship is likely to grow closer in the future as Greek influence on club boards grows.

<P>
<H3>Greece and the P&amp;I Clubs
</H3> 
<B>By Graham Edmiston, Chairman, A Bilbrough &amp; Co, Managers of the London P&amp;I Club</B>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Greece was not, by and large, a very sophisticated shipping market. Today, it is both sophisticated and knowledgeable, and second only as a shipmanagement centre to the Far East. It is home to the head offices of some of the largest and most advanced shipmanagement operations in the world. And it is a very demanding and discriminating consumer of shipping services.
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, many small Greek shipowners bought defence cover as part of their P&amp;I
package, without knowing what it offered. Now most Greek shipowners and their managers are well-acquainted with the P&amp;I rulebook and expect and demand a high standard of service from
their clubs.
<P>
Any P&amp;I club competing in the Greek market has to provide a high standard of service, both in
terms of time and commitment and in practical experience and legal and technical knowledge.
Greece is a very demanding market for P&amp;I club managers, because Greek owners tend to lean
heavily on their clubs for legal and professional support and advice.
<P>
Greek shipping companies, being family-controlled, value personal relationships with the providers of shipping support services. They also value tradition, and they often show remarkable loyalty towards - and confidence in - their professional advisers, including their P&amp;I club managers. Many old-established Greek shipping companies have remained with the same P&amp;I club for many decades, in some cases approaching a century.
<P>
Traditionally, Greek shipowners eat, sleep and drink the business. Many Greek owners have learnt
the lesson that good service counts for much more than a marginal reduction in premium rating,
which may well prove an illusory benefit, if higher supplementary calls result.  Any reduction in premium rating can soon be offset by the loss of income to shipowners if their ships remain under arrest for a period of days, while their clubs investigate the casualty and take time to arrange the necessary security to release the ships.
<P>
Greek shipowners take their membership of P&amp;I club boards seriously and take a very active
interest in club affairs. Thus, it was not surprising that they should have reacted more quickly and more strongly than other shipowners' associations to the 20 per cent compromise proposal for the limitation of club cover, which was introduced to the shipowning community, by stealth, in April 1995.  
<P>
The Greek shipping organisations were the first to protest publicly against the compromise proposal and attracted some unpopularity as a result. However, it is quite clear from the response received to the UK Club's recent questionnaire to its membership that the desire for a lower limit on club cover is shared by shipowners in North America, Scandinavia, the Middle East, the UK, France, Germany and the Far East as well as in Greece.
<P>
Given their traditional distrust of bureaucracy, authority and regulation, Greek owners will continue to question established practice and convention and to challenge accepted wisdom. They are strong supporters of the P&amp;I mutual system although, to date, they have not played a prominent role in club management. There are now a number of Greeks employed by the clubs, however, and it seems inevitable that some will rise to the top in the foreseeable future.
<P>
The relationship between the Greek shipowning community and P&amp;I clubs has been somewhat
shaken over the last twelve months by the compromise limitation debate, and the owners will be
expecting their club managers to press their demands for a lower limit during the current year.
However, the relationship between Greek owner and P&amp;I manager remains, for the most part, one
of mutual trust and respect. 
<P>
The London Club's Greek membership has more than doubled over the last five years and stands
at 12.5m gt today - almost half the club's directly entered tonnage. The managers are confident
that, provided they can maintain the level of service to this growing clientele, then their links with the Greek shipping community will continue to strengthen.

<H3>A healthy change
</H3> 
<B>By Graham Edmiston, chairman of A Bilbrough &amp; Co, managers of the London Club</B>
<P>
<I>Graham Edmiston recently addressed the "P&amp;I - Is There A Future For Mutuality" conference organised by IBC in London. In this article he looks at the changing relationship between P&amp;I clubs and their managers</I>
<P>
ALL fourteen clubs in the International Group are well-established institutions. Indeed, nine of them are over a hundred years old. Most clubs can boast the continuous membership of some shipowners since the turn of the century.
<P>
The relationships between the managers and the members of these clubs is also steeped in tradition.  But the relationship has changed a great deal over the years, most recently as a result of the debate among the clubs over whether to accept the International Group compromise proposal on limitation of liability.
<P>
While many of the founding club managers were shipowners, most now have a professional rather than a commercial background. Many are lawyers, some are former seafarers and former employees of shipping companies, some come from the Lloyd's insurance market and a few are accountants.
<P>
Until recently, the general ethos and spirit of club management was professional, with a strong legal bias. There was not a terribly strong reputation for financial management because the financial growth of the clubs was not considered to be of prime importance. Close financial estimating, budgeting and control was not considered an essential of club management.
<P>
Now there is a much stronger focus on the financial affairs of the clubs. This includes sophisticated computer programing and actuarial projections for budgeting and forecasting purposes, strategic control of the management of club investment funds, and corporate strategic planning in order to make use of the most favourable tax and regulatory environments. Thus, financial directors are now vital members of the new senior management teams.
<P>
The relationship between the manager and the member has strong similarities to the lawyer/client and doctor/patient relationships. The manager is in a position of fiduciary trust, operating in accordance with a rulebook which effectively constitutes a code of ethics. Managers must try to treat all members alike, from the largest to the smallest, in a fair and even-handed - but, if necessary firm - manner. They do of course have the power to exercise the ultimate sanction - termination of membership - but members are entitled to the benefit of the doubt for as long as they are with the club. In the past, managers have not been in the habit of taking a member's premium and then rejecting a claim on a technicality.
<P>
In recent years, club managers have taken a greater interest in the condition of  entered ships. Many clubs now undertake pre-entry condition surveys and continuous ship inspection programmes. Some club managements have taken a particular initiative in helping their members to introduce and improve their safety management systems. Club managers are also taking a more active and positive role in promoting greater loss prevention awareness and safer working practices on board their members' vessels.
<P>
Very few club managers have a commercial or business background. In the absence of any formal management training or qualifications, they pick up management skills as they go along. They learn by trial and error. Most club managements are independent companies which negotiate a management fee with the club's board on an annual basis. Many are partnerships. As a general rule, they do not expect to make a fortune. They do expect to make a decent living as successful professionals.
<P>
Club managers are not exposed to the commercial vagaries of the shipping market. Indeed, they have in the past been described as sitting on an unsinkable raft. There was a time when club management in the UK was  established and conservative, with each club having its traditional geographical areas of influence. Managers wouldn't dream of visiting the members of other clubs in order to solicit their business. It was not the done thing. It was not cricket. Subsequently, the entry of the Scandinavian clubs into the international market introduced an element of much more aggressive competition, which is still with us today.
<P>
Today, managers spend much of their time marketing or selling, trying to attract new business. They are selling not so much a service as a product. Competition is based more on cost. Under the International Group agreement, holding clubs can indicate to a shipowner that they are likely to be cheaper in the long run than competing clubs. They can point to their supplementary calls record. They can claim that their management costs are less and their service just as good. Indeed, in recent years, many clubs have concentrated on building up their financial strength so as to be sure of keeping within their originally estimated supplementaries.
<P>
Despite all the competition that exists today, the best shipowners and shipping companies usually remain loyal to their clubs and thereby reap the benefits of mutual trust and respect which come from having a long relationship with their managers.
<P>
Past financial performance and future financial projections are not the best ways in which to judge the true worth of a club. All club managers claim to provide a high level of service, but some devote more resources to their service than others. The clubs do not have a uniform reputation for service.
<P>
Clubs are so very well-established and such old institutions compared with most shipping companies that the attitude of the managers towards their members sometimes appears to be paternalistic or patronising. Managers often know what is best for the member and take a decision or give instructions on behalf of the member without fully explaining the options or seeking prior approval. This is understandable, for many reasons.
<P>
Sometimes, a decision has to be taken urgently, and it is often the club funds which are ultimately at risk. Moreover, it is often difficult and time-consuming to explain every aspect of a problem, or a complex point of English law, to a member whose mother tongue is not English. 
<P>
Such difficulties, however, are no excuse for not taking the time and trouble to explain everything that has to be explained. Too many club managers have taken too little trouble in the past, There is evidence that shipowners will expect more in the future. This must be right because, without shipowners, there would be no P&amp;I clubs, and there is no reason why those shipowners should be English.
<P>
The catastrophe/limitation debate, which crystallised into the acceptance of a group compromise proposal at renewal this year, has further changed the relationship between managers and club members. It has revived the interest of the shipping and insurance industries in P&amp;I, and of shipowners in their clubs. It has also led to the managers of all the clubs writing to their members at some length on the subject, and justifying the position they have taken in the debate. It does seem that the managers and boards of a number of clubs want to canvass the views of their members and will be doing so this year.
<P>
Some participants in the debate remain of the view that the maintenance of group unity is of such paramount importance that club boards should have accepted the recommendations of the working group of club managers without question. The compromise proposal certainly represented an attempt by the managers of the leading club protagonists, for and against the limit, to find a peace formula which would put this troublesome and divisive subject to rest for as long as possible. But it is unsatisfactory.
<P>
We effectively have a continuation of unlimited cover, with the member just as exposed to the risk of bankruptcy in the event of an overspill claim as ever before. I can only conclude that the debate which has ensued is healthy. Club managers have served their members very well over the years but they should not always presume to know what is best for them. Managers should be prepared to listen to their members as well as guide and protect them.
<P>
The public nature of the catastrophe debate has accelerated a process of change in the manager/member relationship which was already under way. Competition and globalisation were already forcing club managers to pay close attention to the needs of their members. But this debate has shown both managers and members that club boards don't always represent the full scope of the membership.
<P>
If club managers continue to turn a deaf ear to the views of their members, the relationship of trust and respect which has been developed between managers and members over many decades will gradually be eroded. Club managers must help develop practical, commercial solutions to shipowners' legitimate needs - and the simpler the better. Complicated, intellectual, theoretical, legalistic castles in the air are a complete waste of time.
<P>
Club managers are professionals serving a very commercial insustry. They must find commercial solutions. They will only find those solutions by listening carefully to their members. If club managers become too remote and aloof from shipowners, they will no longer be able to serve them properly. Club managers should not assume a position of intellectual superiority. 
<P>
The limitation debate has shaken up the relationship between managers and members. Managers now realise that they must inform, advise and consult their members more on important subjects. Members will be looking at their managerrs and their clubs with a close and more critical eye in the future. They will be less inclined to accept their managers' recommendations without question, particularly on important matters of general principle.
<P>
The commercial interests of club managers and club members do not always coincide. But it would be a gross exaggeration to say that that the limitation debate has undermined for ever the relationship between the two. The relationship is in fact still a strong and healthy one.
<P>
The jury is still out on the compromise limitation solution, as it now stands. Members, and informed market commentators, are waiting to see what club managers will do next. Whatever happens, club managers will not be able to hide behind their club boards. It will not be good enough for them to say that they have no mandate from their boards to participate in further discussions on limitation. 
<P>
Members still have a great fund of trust and confidence in their managers, but they will be watching them closely during the new club year.

<H3>Greece and the P&amp;I market</H3> 
<P>
<B>By Graham Edmiston, Chairman, A Bilbrough &amp; Co, Managers of the London P&amp;I Club</B>
<P>
Having been involved as a P&amp;I and defence club manager with the Greek shipping community over the last 25 years, I have witnessed at close hand the steady development of this market, both in numbers and size of ships and owners and in the standards of ship maintenance, operations and management, in professional and technical training and in organisation and skills. 
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Greece was not, by and large, a very sophisticated shipping market. In those days, an expatriate shipping executive in Piraeus could say with some justification : In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
<P>
Now Greece is a very sophisticated and knowledgeable shipping market and the major centre of shipmanagement outside the Far East.  It houses the head offices of some of the largest and most advanced shipmanagement operations in the world. And it is a very demanding and discriminating consumer of shipping services.
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, many small Greek shipowners bought defence  cover as part of their P&amp;I package, without knowing what this cover offered. Now most Greek shipowners and their managers are well- acquainted with the P&amp;I rulebook and expect and demand a high standard of service from their P&amp;I clubs.
<P>
Any P&amp;I club competing in the Greek market has to provide a high standard of service, both in terms of time and commitment - which often extends outside normal office hours - and in practical experience and legal and technical knowledge. Greece is a very demanding market for P&amp;I club managers. Greek owners tend to lean heavily upon them for legal and professional support and advice.
<P>
The reward for providing a good and reliable service and constant support and assistance to the shipowner in its hour of trial and need is the shipowners' respect, loyalty and friendship over many years.  Greek shipping companies, being family-controlled, value personal relationships with the providers of shipping support services and also tradition, and they often show remarkable loyalty towards, and confidence in, their professional advisers, including their P&amp;I club managers. Many old-established Greek shipping companies have remained with the same P&amp;I club for many decades, in some cases approaching a century.
<P>
While Greek shipowners demand a great deal from their P&amp;I club managers from time to time, they are not slow to show their appreciation for good work done. Traditionally, Greek shipowners eat, sleep and drink the business, and if their P&amp;I club managers support this dedication, then a close relationship of mutual trust and respect will develop. Many Greek owners have learnt the lesson that good service counts for much more than a marginal reduction in premium rating, which may well prove an illusory benefit, if higher supplementary calls result.  Any reduction in premium rating can soon be offset by the loss of income to shipowners if their ships remain under arrest for a period of days, while their clubs investigate the casualty and take time to arrange the necessary security to release the ships.
<P>
The Greek shipowning community is now well-represented on the boards of P&amp;I clubs. Until October 1995, Miles Kulukundis was chairman of the UK Club.  In January 1996, John M Lyras was elected chairman of the London Club, and Spyros Polemis is chairman of the Newcastle Club.  The West of England has two Greek vice-chairmen.
<P>
Greek shipowners take their membership of P&amp;I club boards seriously and take a very active interest in club affairs. Thus, it was not surprising that they should have reacted more quickly and more strongly than other shipowners' associations to the 20 per cent compromise proposal for the limitation of club cover, which was introduced to the shipowning community, by stealth, in April 1995.  The Greek shipping organisations were the first to protest publicly against the compromise proposal and attracted some unpopularity as a result. However, it is quite clear from the response received to the UK Club's recent questionnaire to its membership that the desire for a lower limit on club cover is shared by shipowners in North America, Scandinavia, the Middle East, the UK, France, Germany and the Far East as well as in Greece.
<P>
Because P&amp;I clubs are mutual organisations, Greek shipowners will continue to play an increasingly active role at board level, in the direction and policy-making of the clubs. With their traditional distrust of bureaucracy, authority and regulation, they will continue to question established practice and convention and to challenge accepted wisdom.  They are strong supporters of the P&amp;I mutual system because of the clubs' strong traditions of professional service and dedication and because the clubs are living, evolving institutions, responsive to the members' needs and demands.
<P>
To date, Greeks have not played a prominent role in club management, but there are now a number of Greeks employed by the clubs, and it seems inevitable that some will rise to the top in the foreseeable future.
<P>
The relationship between the Greek shipowning community and P&amp;I clubs has been somewhat shaken over the last twelve months by the compromise limitation debate, and they will be expecting their club managers to press their demands for a lower limit during the current year. However, the relationship between Greek owner and P&amp;I manager remains, for the most part, a healthy one of mutual trust and respect. Both sides recognise the value of each other's traditions and also look towards the future with pride and confidence.
<P>
The London Club's Greek membership has more than doubled over the last five years and stands
at 12.5m gt today, almost half the club's directly entered tonnage. The managers are confident
that, provided they can maintain the level of service to this growing clientele, then their links with the Greek shipping community will continue to strengthen.

<P>
<H3>Vital role for surveyors in London Club ship inspections
</H3> 
<P>
TAKE one ship, preferably empty, one day and one surveyor, and you can get a good idea if there are problems there or not. That is what Keith Atkinson, director of A Bilbrough &amp; Co, which manages the London Club, thinks. Ship inspections on behalf of P&amp;I Clubs has become solid business for marine surveyors  in the last few years. "We spend a lot on ship inspections each year," says  Atkinson. "But the savings are worth it."
<P>
Atkinson is an ex-seafarer himself, and is not alone in that on the board of Bilbroughs. The managers have a reputation for working with owners and helping them, but that doesn't mean they will tolerate ships which do not meet the standards of the club. And their own expertise gives them confidence when it comes to judging the work of surveyors. The London Club carried out 508 ship inspections in the 1994-95 policy year, using contracted surveyors for all of them. "We used to employ staff surveyors, " says Atkinson. "But it is not cost effective as almost all the inspections are done outside the UK, and it is easier and cheaper to use surveyors who are on the spot." 
<P>
To ensure consistency and quality, Bilbrough has a technical manager, James Croall, who assesses surveyors and checks their credentials before entering them on the list of approved surveyors for use by the club. Standard guidelines are given to each surveyor for the inspections. "We call these inspections, not condition surveys," says Atkinson. "We expect surveyors to complete the inspection in one day. A condition survey would take much longer. But a good surveyor can get a fair idea of the ship and crew in one day." The guidance notes come with a standard report form, which allows the surveyor to report items in a YES/NO/Not Examined format. This cuts down on the amount of subjective reporting required. That makes analysis simpler, and reporting more certain. But Atkinson does not discourage amplifying remarks, which the surveyor can attach, and he certainly wants to hear about items of concern, if any, even if they are not specifically asked for on the form.
<P>
"It is essential that the surveyors know exactly what we want," says Atkinson. "Different clubs have different requirements, which is why we give surveyors our own standard guidelines."  That contrasts with the approach taken by Bilbrough when employing surveyors for cargo and property damage surveys. "In most cases the choice of surveyors for damage surveys is left up to our local correspondent," says Atkinson. "We expect them to know the right person for the job locally, but we do keep a register of technical experts in the UK who we can send out if required." 
<P>
For ship inspections, The London Club expects surveyors to liaise with the shipowner to find a suitable time to inspect the ship when it is free of cargo. However, hose tests and pressure tests of tanks are not mandatory at each inspection unless visual inspection makes them seem a good idea. Likewise, if the surveyor can safely enter topside tanks, an inspection of a sample of two is considered enough.
<P>
Tanker inspection is difficult, because cargo tanks are unlikely to be gas free, but the club says a representative sample of two tanks should be inspected if gas free, and two ballast tanks should be inspected internally and reported on. 
<P>
At the end of the inspection, masters get a deficiency list and James Croall wants to see a preliminary report on the fax straight away. A full report, with colour photos, is expected within ten days. But surveyors are warned not to step out of their ground, as it is the prerogative of the club managers to take action over deficiencies, and if follow up inspections are needed, they will normally be to owner's account.
<P>
The results of the inspections show that the same old problems just keep coming back, and certain classification societies seem to be more prone to have ships with deficiencies than others. Hatch covers are a perennial problem, and despite all the effort put into education, the number of deficiencies relating to hatch covers is still higher than Atkinson would like, making up a large proportion of all cargoworthiness deficiencies. Seals, channels, cleats and wedges make up the bulk of the problems. 
<P>
But inspections are not just about steelwork and hatch covers. "We need independent inspectors to look at crewing practices and operational procedures," says Atkinson. "Claims don't arise just because of mechanical items. Shipboard management, manning and qualifications are of vital importance and we want to see them assessed and reported on." Atkinson says that by including the personnel element, P&amp;I ship inspections go beyond class surveys, and enable the managers to form a view of the underlying quality of the owner's operation.
<P>
Ship inspections lend themselves to standard forms and check lists. But Bilbroughs has not attempted to enforce standardisation on cargo and damage surveys. "Each case is different," says Atkinson. "We expect competent surveyors to know what is needed, and if they are not competent, we don't want to employ them." The occasional problems which Atkinson sees with survey reports come from surveyors who express an opinion when no opinion is needed on matters which are not within their areas of technical competence. "If we ask for a report on fire damage, for example," says Atkinson, "we want a report of what the surveyor sees, but an opinion as to cause at that stage may make it difficult for the fire expert later." Other surveyors are too brief, and Atkinson says there is the very occasional unsatisfactory report from far flung places. "Then we have to decide if it is worth flying someone out there or not," he says.
<P>
Surveyors compete fiercely for P&amp;I business, and the advent of containerisation has meant less local cargo damage work to be shared out. To some extent, the new work that ship inspections created has compensated. But Atkinson says there is likely to be a downward trend there, at least as far as the London Club is concerned. "We inspect ships which are over  ten years old," he says. "But as the average age of our fleet improves, there are less inspections." In 1991/92 the London Club had 909 ships eligible for inspection and 573 were selected. Last year, despite an increase in tonnage for the club, there were 775 ships eligible, and 550 were selected. The age profile is falling constantly as the club's underwriters actively exclude older and smaller tonnage, concentrating on  less risky newer and larger bulk tonnage. The London Club has definite plans to get bigger, but not at the expense of taking on poor quality tonnage. That must mean a boost for ship inspection work when the new members first come along. But as most of the new tonnage will be in the younger bracket, there will be less inspections overall and in the future. Inspections will remain as a major tool in the club's loss prevention programme, helping to control claims and so rewarding members by reducing the total claims cost. Good news for the London Club, mixed news for surveyors.

<LI>We, the Heads of State and Government of seven major
industrialized nations and the President of the European
Commission, have met in Halifax for our 21st annual Summit.  We
have gathered at a time of change and opportunity, and have
reaffirmed our commitment to working together and with our
partners throughout the world.<P>

<A NAME="macro">
<CENTER><H3>GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT</CENTER></H3></A>
<LI>The central purpose of our economic policy is to improve the
well being of our people, allowing them to lead full and
productive lives.  Creating good quality jobs and reducing
unemployment, which remains unacceptably high in too many of our
countries, is thus an urgent priority for all of us.  We are
committed to establishing an economic environment conducive to
the accomplishment of this goal.<P>

<LI>We remain encouraged by the continued strong growth in much
of the world's economy.  While there has been some slowing, in
most of our countries the conditions for continued growth appear
to be in place and inflation is well under control.  We will
pursue appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies to
maintain the momentum of growth.<P>

<LI>Yet problems remain.  Internal and external imbalances,
together with unhelpful fluctuations in financial and currency
markets, could jeopardize achievement of sustained,
noninflationary growth as well as the continued expansion of
international trade.<P>

<LI>We remain committed to the medium-term economic strategy that
we earlier agreed upon.  Consistent with it, we are determined to
make the best possible use of the current economic expansion by
taking steps to promote durable job creation.  This requires
determined action to further reduce public deficits, to maintain
a non-inflationary environment and to increase national savings
for the funding of a high level of global investment.  Each
country has to keep its own house in order.<P>

<LI>We endorse the conclusions reached by G-7 Finance Ministers
in Washington and ask them to maintain close cooperation in
economic surveillance and in exchange markets.<P>

<LI>Good fiscal and monetary policies will not on their own
deliver the full fruits of better economic performance.  We must
also remove obstacles to achieving the longer-term potential of
our economies to grow and create secure, well-paying jobs.  This
will require measures to upgrade the skills of our labour force,
and to promote, where appropriate, greater flexibility in labour
markets and elimination of unnecessary regulations.  At Naples we
committed ourselves to a range of reforms in the areas of
training and education, labour market regulation and adjustment,
technological innovation and enhanced competition. As we pursue
these reforms, we welcome the initiation by the OECD of a
detailed review of each member economy's structural and
employment policies.<P>

<LI>As a follow up to our discussions, we agree to ask ministers
to meet in France before our next Summit to review the progress
made in job creation and consider how best to increase employment
in all of our countries.<P>

<LI>We are also committed to ensuring protection for our aging
populations and those in need in our societies.  To this end,
some of our countries must take measures to ensure the
sustainability of our public pension programs and systems of
social support.  Similar attention is required in some of our
countries to ensuring the availability of private sector pension
funds.<P> 

<LI>We welcome the results of the G-7 Information Society
conference held in Brussels in February, including the eight core
policy principles agreed to by Ministers, and encourage
implementation of the series of pilot projects designed to help
promote innovation and the spread of new technologies.  We also
welcome the involvement of the private sector.  We encourage a
dialogue with developing countries and economies in transition in
establishing the Global Information Society, and welcome the
proposal that an information society conference be convened in
South Africa in spring 1996.<P> 

<CENTER><H3>MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST
CENTURY</CENTER></H3>

<LI>International institutions have been central to our pursuit
of stability, prosperity and equity for the past 50 years.  Last
year, in Naples, we called for a review of the international
institutions to ensure that they are equipped to deal effectively
with the challenges of the future.  Today, in Halifax, we are
proposing some concrete steps toward this goal.  All countries
have a stake in effective, efficient institutions.  We pledge our
full energies to strengthening the institutions in partnership
with their entire membership to enhance the security and 
prosperity of the world.<P> 

<CENTER><B>Strengthening the Global Economy</B></CENTER>

<LI>The world economy has changed beyond all recognition over the
last fifty years.  The process of globalization, driven by
technological change, has led to increased economic
interdependence: this applies to some policy areas seen
previously as purely domestic, and to interactions between policy
areas. The major challenge confronting us is to manage this
increased interdependence while working with the grain of
markets, and recognizing the growing number of important players. 
This is especially important in the pursuit of global
macroeconomic and financial stability.<P>

<LI>Close consultation and effective cooperation on macroeconomic
policies among the G-7 are important elements in promoting
sustained non-inflationary growth avoiding the emergence of large
external and internal imbalances, and promoting-greater exchange
market stability.  Our Ministers have adopted a number of changes
to the structure of their consultations over time, in order to
strengthen policy cooperation, including enhanced consultation
with the IMF.<P>

<A NAME="monetary">
<LI>The growth and integration</A> of global capital markets have
created both enormous opportunities and new risks.  We have a
shared interest in ensuring the international community remains
able to manage the risks inherent in the growth of private
capital flows, the increased integration of domestic capital
markets, and the accelerating pace of financial innovation.<P>

<LI>The developments in Mexico earlier this year and their
repercussions have sharpened our focus on these issues.  We
welcome the recent more positive turn of events in Mexico, as
well as the positive developments in a number of emerging
economies.<P>

<LI>The prevention of crisis is the preferred course of action. 
This is best achieved through each country pursuing sound fiscal
and monetary policies.  But it also requires an improved early
warning system, so that we can act more quickly to prevent or
handle financial shocks.  Such a system must include improved and
effective surveillance of national economic policies and
financial market developments, and fuller disclosure of this
information to market participants.  To this end, we urge the IMF
to:<P>
<UL> 
<LI>establish benchmarks for the timely publication of key
economic and financial data;<P>
<LI>establish a procedure for the regular public identification
of countries which comply with these benchmarks;<P>
<LI>insist on full and timely reporting by member countries of
standard sets of data, provide sharper policy advice to all
governments, and deliver franker messages to countries that
appear to be avoiding necessary actions.<P>
</UL>

<LI>If prevention fails, financial market distress requires that
multilateral institutions and major economies be able to respond
where appropriate in a quick and coordinated fashion.  Financing
mechanisms must operate on a scale and with the timeliness
required to manage shocks effectively.  In this context, we urge
the IMF to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>establish a new standing procedure -- 
"Emergency Financing Mechanism"-- which would provide faster
access to Fund arrangements with strong conditionality and larger
upfront disbursements in crisis situations.<P>
</UL>

<LI>To support this procedure, we ask:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the G-10 and other countries with the capacity to support the
system to develop financing arrangements with the objective of
doubling as soon as possible the amount currently available under
the GAB to respond to financial emergencies;<P>
</UL>

<LI>To ensure that the IMF has sufficient resources to meet its
ongoing responsibilities, we urge continued discussions on a new
IMF quota review.<P>

<LI>Solid progress on the elements discussed above should
significantly improvements may not be sufficient in all cases. 
In line with this, and recognizing the complex legal and other
issues posed in debt crisis situations by the wide variety of
sources of international finance involved, we would encourage
further review by G-10 Ministers and Governors of other
procedures that might also usefully be considered for their
orderly resolution.<P>

<LI>We continue to support the inclusion of all IMF members in
the SDR system. Moreover, we urge the IMF to initiate a broad
review of the role and functions of the SDR in light of changes
in the world financial system.<P>

<LI> Closer international cooperation in the regulation and
supervision of financial institutions and markets is essential to
safeguard the financial system and prevent an erosion of
prudential standards.  We urge:<P>
<UL>

<LI>a deepening of cooperation among regulators and supervisory
agencies to ensure an effective and integrated approach, on a
global basis, to developing and enhancing the safeguards,
standards, transparency and systems necessary to monitor and
contain risks;<P>

<LI>continued encouragement to countries to remove capital market
restrictions, coupled with strengthened policy advice from
international financial institutions on the appropriate
supervisory structures;<P>

<LI>Finance ministers to commission studies and analysis from the
international organizations responsible for banking and
securities regulations and to report on the adequacy of current
arrangements, together with proposals for improvement where
necessary, at the next Summit.<P>
</UL>

<LI>We also recognize that international financial fraud is a
growing problem.  We are committed to improving communication
between regulators and law enforcement agencies.<P>
<A NAME="develop">
<CENTER><B>Promoting Sustainable Development</CENTER></B></A>

<LI>A higher quality of life for all people is the goal of
sustainable development.  Democracy, human rights, transparent
and accountable governance, investment in people and 
environmental protection are the foundations of sustainable
development.  The primary responsibility rests with each country
but bilateral and multilateral international cooperation is
essential to reinforce national efforts.  We are committed to
securing substantial flows of funds and to improving the quality
of our assistance.<P>

<LI>IDA plays an indispensable role in helping to reduce poverty
and integrate the poorest countries into the global economy.  We
urge all donor countries to fulfil promptly their commitments to
IDA- 10 and to support a significant replenishment through IDA-
11.  We look forward to the recommendations of the Development
Committee's Task Force on Multilateral Development Banks.<P>

<LI>Multilateral institutions play a crucial role by providing
intellectual leadership and policy advice, and by marshalling
resources for countries committed to sustainable development. 
The United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions should
build on their respective strengths.  The UN offers a unique
forum for consensus building on global priorities, is an advocate
for core values, and responds to development and humanitarian
needs.  The Bretton Woods institutions have a particular role in
promoting macroeconomic stability, in supporting favourable
environments for sustainable development and in mobilizing and
transferring resources for development.  We will work with the
organizations and all their members to ensure relevant
multilateral institutions:<P>
<UL>

<LI>make sustainable development a central goal of their policies
and programmes, including by intensifying and deepening the
integration of environmental considerations into all aspects of
their programmes;<P>

<LI>encourage countries to follow sound economic, environmental
and social policies and to create the appropriate legal and
structural framework for sustainable development;<P>

<LI>encourage countries to follow participatory development
strategies and support governmental reforms that assure
transparency and public accountability, a stable rule of law, and
an active civil society;<P> 

<LI>encourage the development of a healthy private sector, expand
guarantees and co-financing arrangements to catalyze private
flows, and increase credit for small and medium-sized
enterprises;<P>

<LI>continue to provide resources for the infrastructure needed
for sustainable development, where these are not available from
the private sector.<P>
</UL>

<LI>We agree on the need to actively support the peace process in
the Middle-East. Such support would include the establishment of
a new institution and financing mechanism enhancing regional
cooperation.  We therefore urge the Task Force already at work to
continue its deliberations with an aim to arriving at a suitable
proposal in time for the Amman summit next October.<P>

<CENTER><B>Reducing Poverty</CENTER></B>

<LI>An overriding priority is to improve the plight of the
world's poor.  Persistence of extreme poverty and marginalization
of the poorest countries is simply not compatible with universal
aspirations for prosperity and security.  Sub-Saharan Africa
faces especially severe challenges.  We will work with others to
encourage relevant multilateral institutions to:<P>
<UL>

<LI>focus concessional resources on the poorest countries,
especially those in Sub-Sahara Africa, which have a demonstrated
capacity and commitment to use them effectively, and take trends
in military and other unproductive spending into account in
extending assistance;<P>

<LI>direct a substantially increased proportion of their
resources to basic social programmes and other measures which
attack the roots of poverty.<P>
</UL>
<LI>We welcome the Paris Club response to our encouragement last
year to improve the treatment of the debt of the poorest
countries and urge the full and constructive implementation of
the Naples terms.  We recognize that some of the poorest
countries have substantial multilateral debt burdens.  We will
encourage:<P>

<UL>
<LI> the Bretton Woods institutions to develop a comprehensive
approach to assist countries with multilateral debt problems,
through the flexible implementation of existing instruments and
new mechanisms where necessary;<P>

<LI>better use of all existing World Bank and IMF resources and
adoption of appropriate measures in the multilateral development
banks to advance this objective and to continue concessional ESAF
lending operations.<P>
</UL>
<LI>Open markets throughout the world are also crucial to work to
assist the integration of the poorest countries into the world
trading system.  We encourage the WTO to monitor and review the
Uruguay Round's impact on the least developed countries.<P>

<A NAME="enviro">
<CENTER><B>Safeguarding the Environment</CENTER></B></A>
<LI> We place top priority on both domestic and international
action to safeguard the environment.  Environmental protection
triggers the development and deployment of innovative
technologies, which enhance economic efficiency and growth and
help create long term employment.  In their policies, operations
and procurement, G-7 governments must show leadership in
improving the environment.  This will require the appropriate mix
of economic instruments, innovative accountability mechanisms,
environmental impact assessment and voluntary measures.  Efforts
must focus on pollution prevention, the "polluter pays"
principle, internalization of environmental costs, and the
integration of environmental considerations into policy and
decision making in all sectors.<P>

<LI>We underline the importance of meeting the commitments we
made at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and subsequently, and the need
to review and strengthen them, where appropriate.  Climate change
remains of major global importance.  We will work with others
to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>fulfil our existing obligations under the Climate Change
Convention, and our commitments to meet the agreed ambitious
timetable and objectives to follow up the Berlin Conference of
the Parties;<P>

<LI>implement the medium term work program adopted pursuant to
the Convention on Biological Diversity;<P>

<LI>conclude successfully the work of the CSD intergovernmental
panel on forests, and promote a successful UN Conference on
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and
international consensus at the next CSD session on action to deal
with the problems of the world's oceans.<P>
</UL>
<LI> We encourage a clearer delineation of the mandates of the
CSD and UNEP.  CSD should be the global forum for identifying and 
agreeing upon long term strategic goals for sustainable
development.  UNEP should act as an international environmental
voice and catalyst; it should focus on monitoring, assessment,
and the development of international environmental law.<P>

<CENTER><B>Preventing and Responding to Crises</CENTER></B>

<LI>titutional machinery.  To help prevent and mitigate emerging
crises, including those with human rights and refugee dimensions,
we will ask:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the UN Secretary General to explore means to improve the
analysis and utilization of disaster and conflict-related early
warning information, particularly through the High Commissioners
on Human Rights and Refugees;<P>

<LI>the Bretton Woods institutions and the U.N. to establish a
new coordination procedure, supported as necessary by existing
resources, to facilitate a smooth transition from the emergency
to the rehabilitation phase of a crisis, and to cooperate more
effectively with donor countries;<P>
<LI>the bodies involved in the provision of humanitarian
assistance to cooperate more closely with the Department of
Humanitarian Affairs in its assigned coordination role.<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="reform">
<CENTER><B>Reinforcing Coherence, Effectiveness and Efficiency of
Institutions</CENTER></B></A> 
<LI>To fufil their missions effectively into the future,
multilateral institutions must continue to undertake reforms and
to improve coordination and reduce overlap.  The international
financial institutions have shown flexibility in responding to
the changing needs of  the world economy; there nevertheless
remain a number of areas where improvements are  desirable to
better prepare the institutions for the challenges ahead.  We
will encourage:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the World Bank and the regional development banks to
decentralize  their operations where  possible;<P>

<LI>the IMF and World Bank to concentrate on their respective
core concerns (broadly, macroeconomic policy for the IMF and
structural and sectoral policies for the  World Bank);<P>

<LI>revision of the Ministerial committees of the IMF and World
Bank to promote more effective decision-making;<P>

<LI>the World Bank Group to integrate more effectively the
activities of the International Finance Corporation and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency into its country
assistance strategies;<P>

<LI>the multilateral development banks to coordinate their
respective country programmes more effectively with bilateral and
other multilateral donors.
</UL>
<LI>So as to allow the United Nations better to meet the
objectives in its Charter, we will encourage broadening and
deepening the reform process already underway, and will work with
others to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>complete the Agenda for Development, which should set out a
fresh approach to international cooperation and define the
particular contribution expected of UN bodies;

<LI>develop a more effective internal policy coordination role
for the Economic and Social Headquarters and in the field;
consolidate and streamline organizations in the economic and
Social fields, such as humanitarian relief and development
assistance; and encourage the adoption of Council (ECOSOC);
encourage deeper cooperation between UN and specialized agencies
both at modem management techniques, with a more transparent and
accountable Secretariat;<P>

<LI>update and focus mandates to avoid duplication; eliminate
overlaps with  new organizations, eg.  UNCTAD with WTO, and
consider the roles of certain institutions in light  of evolving
challenges, eg.  Regional Economic Commissions and UNIDO;<P>
</UL> 

We call upon Member States to meet their financial obligations
and urge early agreement on reform of the system of
assessment.<P>

<LI>To increase overall coherence, cooperation and cost
effectiveness we will work with others to encourage:<P>
<UL>
<LI>rationalization of data collection, analysis, priority
setting, and reporting activities, and greater complementarity in
the provision of assistance at the country level;<P>

<LI>improved coordination among international organizations,
bilateral donors and NGOs;<P>

<LI>all institutions to formulate and implement plans to effect
significant reductions in operating costs over the next few
years.<P>
</UL>
<CENTER><B>Follow-up</CENTER></B>

<LI>These are our initial proposals to prepare multilateral
institutions for the challenges of the next century.  We intend
to promote them actively, working together with the wider
international community in all appropriate organizations.  In
particular, in the UN, we commit ourselves to working with other
members to advance these goals.  We will use the 50th anniversary
celebrations in October 1995 to build consensus on these
priorities with others.  We will take stock at our meeting next
year in France.<P>

<A NAME="trade">
<CENTER><H3>CREATING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH OPEN
MARKETS</CENTER></H3></A>

<LI>We recognize that new investment and increased trade are
vital to achieving our growth and employment objectives.  In a
global market, opportunities for domestic and foreign producers
and suppliers of goods and services depend as much on domestic
policies as on external barriers.  In order to improve market
access, we intend to work for the reduction of remaining internal
and external barriers.<P>

<LI>We will implement the Uruguay Round Agreements fully, and
reaffirm our commitment to resist protectionism in all its forms.
We will build on the Agreements to create new opportunities for
growth, employment and global cooperation.  We will work together
and with our trading partners to consolidate the WTO as an
effective institution, and are committed to ensuring a
well-functioning and respected dispute settlement mechanism.  We
endorse closer cooperation between the WTO and other
international economic institutions.  We recognize the importance
of enhancing the transparency of the WTO.<P>

<LI>We support accession to the WTO in accordance with the rules
that apply to all of its members and on the basis of meaningful
market access commitments.  We are committed to ensuring that our
participation in regional trade initiatives continues to be a
positive force for the multilateral system.<P>

<LI> The momentum of trade liberalization must be maintained.  We
are committed to the successful completion of current
negotiations in services sectors and, in particular, significant
liberalization in financial and telecommunications services.  We
will proceed with follow-up work foreseen in the Uruguay Round
Final Act.  We encourage work in areas such as technical
standards, intellectual property and government procurement; an
immediate priority is the negotiation in the OECD of a high
standard multilateral agreement on investment.  We will begin
discussions on investment with our partners in the WTO.  We
recognize that initiatives such as regulatory reform have a
particularly important contribution to make to trade
liberalization and economic growth by removing administrative and
structural impediments to global competition.<P>

<LI>Consistent with the goal of continued trade liberalization,
we will pursue work on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>trade and environment to ensure that rules and policies in
these different areas are compatible;<P>

<LI>the scope for multilateral action in the fields of trade and
competition policy;<P>

<LI>trade, employment and labour standards.<P>
</UL>
<LI>We will work together with our partners in the WTO and other
appropriate fora to create the basis for an ambitious first WTO
Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in 1996.<P>

<CENTER><H3>ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION</CENTER></H3>

<LI>We recognize the progress of many countries in transition
toward democratic, market-based societies.  Early and determined
macroeconomic stabilization has proven the most effective
strategy to allow an early return to growth.  To consolidate
these gains, the process of far reaching structural reform must
be pursued vigorously.  We will continue our support for economic
reform in the economies in transition, and their integration into
the global trade and financial systems.  We recognize their need
for improved market access.<P>

<LI>We welcome the good start Ukraine has made on its bold
program of economic reform.  The recent Stand-By Arrangement with
the IMF provided the basis for substantial financial support by
the international financial institutions and bilateral donors. 
We encourage Ukraine to continue its reform efforts in close
cooperation with the international financial institutions. 
Assuming the continuation of strong economic reform, an
additional $2 billion in commitments could be available from the
international financial institutions by the end of 1996.<P>

<LI> We are encouraged by Russia's renewed commitments to
financial stabilization and economic reform.  Continued political
reform is also necessary.  We believe that a stable political,
regulatory and legal environment, and the development of a modem
financial sector, together with the full implementation of the
policy measures outlined in the recently-signed IMF Stand-By
Arrangement, will promote Russian economic recovery.  We welcome
the June 3 Paris Club debt rescheduling agreement and recognize
the relevance of a comprehensive multilateral treatment of
Russia's external public debt.  We also note Russia's interest in
working in close cooperation with  the Paris Club.<P>

<A NAME="nuclear">
<CENTER><H3>NUCLEAR SAFETY</CENTER></H3>
<LI> Each country is responsible for the safety of its nuclear
facilities.  We welcome progress to date in improving levels of
nuclear safety in the countries of central and eastern Europe and
the Newly Independent States.  We congratulate President Kuchma
of Ukraine on his decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant by the year 2000.  We reaffirm the commitments of support
made last year at Naples under the G-7 Action Plan for Ukraine's
Energy Sector.  We are pleased to note the replenishment of the
EBRD Nuclear Safety Account and the commitment of bilateral
resources for short-term safety upgrades and preliminary
decommissioning work for the closure of Chernobyl.  We invite
other donors to join with the G-7 countries in contributing funds
for this purpose.<P>

<LI>In order to assist the closure of Chernobyl, we will continue
our efforts to mobilize international support for appropriate
energy production, energy efficiency and nuclear safety projects. 
Any assistance for replacement power for Chernobyl will be based
on sound cost-effective and environmental criteria.  The World
Bank and EBRD should continue their cooperation with Ukraine in
devising a realistic long-term energy strategy.  They should
increase their financial contribution in support of appropriate
energy sector reform and energy conservation measures, and
mobilize private sector support for energy investments.<P>

<CENTER><H3>NEXT SUMMIT</CENTER></H3>  

<LI>We have accepted the invitation of the President of France to
meet in Lyon from June 27th to 29th, 1996.<P>

<HTML><TITLE>Halifax Summit Political Statement</TITLE><BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="g7color6.gif">
<b><h2>HALIFAX SUMMIT</B></H2>
<br><H3>CHAIRMAN'S POLITICAL STATEMENT</CENTER></H3>
<p>

1.  In this 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War
and the birth of the United Nations, we discussed in a spirit of
cooperation political issues of global importance.  Noting with
satisfaction what has been achieved through reconciliation and
cooperation, we confirmed our desire to work together ever more
closely in finding solutions.<p>

<A NAME="reform">
<b>Commitment to Multilateral Engagement</B><p></A>

2.  We reaffirm our commitment to the U.N., whose Charter lays
down the fundamental principles for an international order based
on peace and security, sustainable development, and respect for
human rights.  We support measures to strengthen the U.N., which
is called upon to play an ever more important role in the post
Cold War period, and will work with other Member States to build,
through concrete reforms of the institutions, a more effective
and efficient organization to meet the challenges of the next
half-century.   We call upon Member States to meet their
financial obligations and urge early agreement on reform of the
system of assessment.<p>

3.  The United Nations must be able to act more quickly and
effectively to address threats to international peace and
security.  We, for our part, are determined to coordinate more
closely our individual efforts to assist in the prevention,
management and resolution of conflicts.  A high priority should
be placed on the early warning of crises, political mediation
and, in accordance with realistic mandates, the rapid deployment
of U.N. civilian and military personnel, including peacekeepers,
to areas of conflict.  We encourage further efforts to improve
operational planning and procedures for peacekeeping missions as
well as to modernize command and control equipment, logistical
arrangements and facilities.  We also stress the need for
measures to ensure the security of U.N. personnel, including the
early entry into force of the recently-adopted U.N. Convention
for the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.  We
welcome the growing role of regional organizations and
arrangements in building stability and security, in the
prevention and management of conflicts, and we attach special
importance to reinforcing cooperation between such organizations
and the United Nations.<p>

<A NAME="armscontrol">
<b>Arms Control and Disarmament</B><p></A>

4.  We welcome the indefinite extension of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the commitment of States party to
the universalisation of the Treaty as well as their decisions to
strengthen the review process and adopt a set of principles and
objectives for non-proliferation and disarmament.  The entry into
force of START I is a major landmark in the process of nuclear
arms control, which was greatly helped by the decision of Ukraine
to accede to the NPT.  We now look forward to the early
ratification of START 11.  We support the safe and secure
dismantlement of the nuclear weapons eliminated under START I and
we welcome the work of the United States and Russia on measures
to ensure that the fissile material from these weapons is
rendered unusable for weapons purposes.  The disposal of
weapons-grade plutonium deserves particular attention and we
encourage its further study.<p>

5.  We are encouraged by the growing international recognition of
the need to complete without delay universal, comprehensive and
verifiable treaties to ban nuclear weapons tests and to cut off
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other
nuclear explosive devices.  Recognizing the continuing dangers
posed worldwide by criminal diversion and illicit trafficking of
nuclear materials, and drawing on the decisions taken in Naples
and the practical work undertaken by our experts since then, we
resolve to work together to strengthen systems of control,
accounting and physical security for nuclear materials; to expand
our cooperation in the area of customs, law enforcement and
intelligence and to strengthen through venues such as the IAEA
and INTERPOL the international community's ability to combat
nuclear theft and smuggling.  We emphasize the importance of
bringing the Chemical Weapons Convention into force at the
earliest possible date, and call for rapid progress in developing
verification systems for the Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention.<p>

6.  The excessive transfer of conventional arms, in particular to
areas of conflict, is one of our main preoccupations.  We are
appalled by the continuing injuries to civilians caused by
anti-personnel landmines.  We urge States to become party to the
1980 Conventional Weapons Convention and to participate in its
review conference this fall in an effort to strengthen
multilateral controls over anti-personnel landmines.  We urge all
countries to support full implementation of the U.N. Register of
Conventional Arms, and note that Article 26 of the U.N. Charter
calls for "the least diversion for armaments of the world's human
and economic resources".  Regional organizations can help promote
transparency and confidence-building measures that reduce
excessive stockpiling of conventional weapons.  We shall work
with others for effective and responsible export controls on arms
and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.<p>

<A NAME="develop">
<b>Promoting New Approaches</B><p>

7.  New approaches are needed in the U.N. and elsewhere to deal
with emerging global challenges such as environmental
degradation, unsustainable population growth, mass displacement
of victims of conflict and involuntary migration across borders. 
Initiatives such as the U.N. Secretary General's Agenda for
Development that highlight the linkages between economic, social
and political issues could make an important contribution to
international stability.  We commit ourselves to working with
other Member States to build on it.  We also recognize the
importance of non-governmental organizations in the U.N.'s work
on economic and social development, including human rights and
humanitarian assistance, and believe that greater coordination of
their efforts with those of the U.N. and other organizations
would benefit the world community.  We reiterate our firm belief
in the necessity for the international community to promote
efficient means to respond promptly to humanitarian emergencies,
and support the work of the WEU in this area.<p>

8.  Respect for the rights of the individual is at the heart of a
durable, secure and prosperous international order.  We will work
to promote good governance and democratic accountability, which
are the surest guarantees of respect for universal human rights
and fundamental freedoms.  We condemn all forms of discrimination
and intolerance, including aggressive nationalism and the
mistreatment of persons belonging to minorities.  We call upon
all States to protect the rights set out in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and to ratify and comply fully with
international Covenants and other multilateral human rights
instruments.  We reaffirm our support for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights and his coordinating role on human
rights throughout the U.N. system.  We call for the strengthening
of international mechanisms of accountability for human rights
violations, and on governments to cooperate fully with courts,
tribunals and investigative commissions, including on the
effective pursuit of individual cases within the bounds of
international and domestic law.<p>

<A NAME="terrorism">
9.  We restate our resolve to defeat all forms of terrorism. </A>
Following recent outrages, we agree to share more intensively our
experiences of, and lessons learned from, major terrorist
incidents, and to strengthen our cooperation in all areas of
counter-terrorism, including research and technology.  We call
upon all States that assist terrorists to renounce terrorism and
to deny financial support, the use of their territory or any
other means of support to terrorist organizations.  We attach
particular importance to measures to impede the ability of
terrorist organizations to raise funds, and urge other
governments to strenuously enforce laws against terrorist
activity and join existing treaties and conventions against
terrorism.  In pursuit of these shared aims, we charge our
terrorism experts group to report to a ministerial level meeting
on specific, cooperative measures to deter, prevent, and
investigate terrorists acts.  These sessions should be held prior
to our next meeting.<p>

10.  Transnational criminal organizations are a growing threat to
the security of our nations.  They undermine the integrity of
financial systems, breed corruption, and weaken emerging
democracies and developing countries around the world.  To
counter their criminal activities effectively, we will work to
reinforce existing institutions, strengthen our cooperation,
exchange of information, and assistance to other nations. 
Sanctuaries provided by some countries to transnational criminal
organizations and their agents create a major difficulty in the
implementation of justice.  We all agree to cooperate more
closely together, and with others, to ensure that they cannot
escape justice by crossing borders.  We encourage all governments
to adhere to and implement relevant international conventions and
the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force.  We
recognize that ultimate success requires all Governments to
provide for effective measures to prevent the laundering of
proceeds from drug trafficking and other serious crimes.  To
implement our commitments in the fight against transnational
organized crime, we have established a group of senior experts
with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for
cooperation both bilateral and multilateral, to identify
significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to
propose practical action to fill such gaps.  The group will
report back to the Summit in 1996.<p>

<b>Europe</B><p>

11.  After five decades of division, we now have the historic
opportunity to establish in all of Europe democracy, market
economy, stability, peace and prosperity.  We strongly support
the contribution of the European Union to stability and
cooperation through its Europe Agreements with Central European
countries and the Baltic States as well as through Partnership
Agreements with Russia, Ukraine and other newly independent
States.  We encourage States to take full advantage of the
opportunities afforded by the Pact on Stability in Europe and
NATO's Partnership For Peace program for enhancing security and
stability in the whole of Europe.  We encourage other
multilateral fora and arrangements to assist in the integration
of Europe.  We are pleased with the steps taken at the Budapest
Summit last year to strengthen the capabilities of the OSCE, and
we will contribute to the OSCE study into a security model for
Europe for the 21st century.<p>

<A NAME="bosnia">
12.  We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation of
hostilities in Bosnia, especially in the area of Sarajevo.</A> We
appeal to all parties to establish an immediate moratorium on
military operations in order to allow political negotiations,
without which no lasting solution is possible, to resume as
quickly as possible on the basis of the Contact Group proposals
which we urge the Bosnian Serbs to accept.<p>

13.  We condemn the taking of U.N. hostages by the Bosnian Serbs,
their deplorable shelling of civilian populations and their
obstruction of UNPROFOR's freedom of movement.  We demand the
immediate and unconditional release of the remaining hostages,
and hold the Bosnian Serb leadership accountable for their
safety.  We call on the Bosnian government and all other parties
to renew the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and to ensure
the free passage of humanitarian assistance.<p>

14.  We welcome the decision of the U.N. Security Council to
strengthen UNPROFOR and to provide it with a rapid reaction
capacity to enhance its security and its ability to protect
civilians, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and
promote conditions for a lasting peace.  The Rapid Reaction Force
will be under U.N. command, as stipulated in the Security Council
resolution, and operate in accordance with UNPROFOR's existing
mandate.<p>

15.  We call for renewed impetus to be given urgently to the
peace process and, in this connection, we welcome the appointment
of Carl Bildt as EU negotiator, and offer our strong support to
him and to U.N. negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg in their efforts
to achieve a durable settlement.<p>

16.  We call for early mutual recognition between the republics
in the former Yugoslavia within their existing internationally
recognized borders; recognition between Bosnia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia would be an important first step, and we
urge President Milosevic to take it.  The Bosnian-Croat
Federation is a way to advance reconciliation, and we continue to
support steps to help stabilize the situation in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<p>

17.  We remain concerned about the risk of further fighting in
Croatia.  Both the Croatian government and the Croatian Serbs
must exercise restraint.  We urge the parties to honour the March
29, 1994 ceasefire and to cooperate with the United Nations in
implementing UNCRO's new mandate.  We call for further
development of the Economic Agreement between the two sides and
the opening of political talks to achieve a settlement respecting
the internationally recognized borders of Croatia while
establishing autonomy for the Serb population on the basis of the
principles underlying the Zagreb-4 Plan for Croatia.<p>

<b>Middle East and Africa</B><p>

18.  The Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty is an important building
block for peace throughout the region.  It is imperative that the
momentum for peace be maintained.  We encourage the conclusion of
peace treaties between Israel and Lebanon and Syria.  We pledge
our firm support for the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of
Principles.  We urge Israel and the Palestinian Authority to
conclude, as agreed between them, the arrangements for elections
in the Palestinian Autonomous Territory and the redeployment of
Israeli Defense Forces.  We also recognize the importance of the
economic basis for peace, notably the need for regional
integration.  We reiterate our call to the League of Arab States
to end its boycott of Israel.<p>

19.  We call upon the Government of Iran to participate
constructively in regional and world affairs, and to desist from
supporting radical groups that seek to destroy the Middle East
Peace Process and destabilize the region.  We also call on the
Iranian Government to reject terrorism and, in particular, to
withdraw its support from the continuing threats to the life of
Mr. Salman Rushdie and others associated with his work.  We call
on all States to avoid any collaboration with Iran which might
contribute to the acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability.<p>

20.  We reiterate our resolve to enforce full implementation of
each and every relevant U.N. Security Council resolution
concerning Iraq and Libya until they are complied with, and
recall that such implementation would entail the reassessment of
sanctions.  We urge Iraq to reconsider its rejection of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 986 which would permit the sale of
oil and purchase of humanitarian goods.<p>

21.  We support the positive steps of the Algerian Government
towards economic reform, and believe that peace and stability
provide the only durable foundation for success.  We call for an
end to the violence in Algeria, and urge all parties that accept
non-violent and democratic principles to pursue political
reconciliation through peaceful dialogue and a genuine electoral
process.<p>

22.  We applaud the peaceful and democratic transition of power
in South Africa, the successful holding of elections elsewhere in
Southern Africa, and the Angolan peace process.  These
developments provide good grounds for optimism about Africa's
longer term prospects.  We will continue to support efforts by
African leaders to prevent conflict and enhance the welfare of
their populations through democratization, structural reform, and
economic liberalization.<p>

23.  We condemn extremists in Burundi and Rwanda and support
measures to hold them accountable for their actions, including
through the International Tribunal for Rwanda.  We call for
greater international support for humanitarian assistance for the
Rwanda/Burundi region.  We support the convening of a U.N. and
OAU-sponsored Conference on Stability and Security in the Lakes
Region.<p>

<b>Asia-Pacific</B><p>

24.  We welcome the emerging dialogue and cooperation in and with
the Asia- Pacific region in various forms including the ASEAN
Regional Forum.  We welcome China's growing participation in
international and regional fora dealing with political, economic
and security issues.  Each of us will pursue our respective
dialogues with China in the interests of a more stable and
prosperous world.  We look forward to a smooth transfer of
government in Hong Kong in 1 997, with the object of maintaining
its economic prosperity and social stability.<p>

25.  We call on North Korea to observe the agreements reached at
the NPT Review and Extension Conference.  We believe the Agreed
Framework between the United States and North Korea offers a real
prospect for resolving the North Korea nuclear problem, and we
are encouraged by recent developments in this regard.  We call on
North Korea to fulfill its commitment to the regime of IAEA
safeguards and to uphold the terms of the Agreed Framework.  The
support of the international community can be demonstrated inter
alia through participation in the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO).  We also believe that progress
in the South-North dialogue will contribute to peace and security
on the Korean Peninsula.<p>

26.  We are concerned about the potential for conflict in Kashmir
and urge all parties to pursue a peaceful settlement.  To help
lower tension and build confidence on the subcontinent, as well
as to strengthen the framework of global security, we urge India
and Pakistan to support international arms control norms, accede
to the NPT and refrain from taking further steps towards
ballistic missile deployment or any other measures that might
precipitate a regional arms race.<p>

27.  We call on the Government of Myanmar to release Aung San Suu
Kyi and other political prisoners, without conditions, and to
engage in a dialogue of reconciliation aimed at the full and
early realization of democracy and national unity.<p>

28.  The South China Sea has become increasingly an area of
territorial dispute.   We call upon all parties to resolve their
differences in a peaceful manner respecting international
norms.<p>

<b>Americas</B><p>

29.  We encourage implementation by the States of the Americas of
the Miami Summit Plan of Action to strengthen democratic
institutions, eliminate the threat of terrorism, eradicate
poverty and discrimination, conserve their natural environment,
and negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas.  We support
the Government of Mexico's bold steps towards political reform
and dialogue.  We commend the efforts of the Guarantor Group of
the Rio Protocol to help Peru and Ecuador achieve a permanent
peace between them.  We support international cooperation in
Haiti's economic and democratic development, and look forward to
free and open legislative elections scheduled for June 25.<p>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Halifax Summit Review of
International Institutions</TITLE></HEAD>  
<BODY><CENTER><IMG SRC="g7color6.gif">
<H2>Halifax Summit</H2>
<p>
<b><h3>Review of<br> 
 International Financial Institutions</B></H3></CENTER>
<HR>

<b>1.  Introduction</b><p>

          At the Naples Summit, G-7 Leaders agreed that the
Halifax Summit should focus on how to "assure that the global
economy of the 21st century will provide sustainable development
with good prosperity and well-being of the peoples of our nations
and the world" by identifying the framework of institutions
required to meet these challenges.<p>

     This paper examines the need for changes to the architecture
of the international financial institutions--i.e. International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the regional development
banks.<p>

     Broadly speaking the international financial institutions
have demonstrated an exceptional degree of flexibility in
adapting to changing demands.  Nevertheless, there remain a
number of areas where improvements are both possible and
desirable.<p>


<b>2.   The Principal Challenges</b><p>

     Today's world is very different from the one in which the
Bretton Woods institutions were created.<p>

<ul>
<li>The global economy is more integrated and, as a result, all
countries have a much greater stake in developments outside their
borders.<p>

<li>World trade has grown steadily and direct and portfolio
investment flow have increased sharply in recent years.<p>

<li>Capital market liberalization, technological change, and
financial innovation have transformed the global financial
landscape--with great benefits, but also new risks.<p>

<li>There is a much greater consensus on the role of the market,
economic incentives, and open policies, and much less faith in
<i>dirigiste</i> solutions to economic problems.<p>

<li>A variety of new global challenges have emerged in areas
such as environmental stewardship and the importance of good
governance.<p>

<li>The influence of developing countries in the world economy
is growing, yet a large portion of the world's population still
lives in extraordinary poverty.<p>

<li>The imperative of continued transition in the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and
elsewhere remains clear.<p></ul>

     These changes leave the international community with a
variety of continuing challenges:  promoting economic policies
that ensure sustained non-inflationary growth and correct
imbalances that engender financial and exchange market
instability; adapting institutional mechanisms to a world of
large and highly mobile private capital, and promoting more
effective sustainable development and poverty reduction.<p>

<b>3.  Constraints and Other Considerations</b><p>

     In exploring potential institutional responses to these
challenges, several general considerations need to be kept in
mind.  Although donor countries face fiscal constraints, which
not only limit their ability to finance new institutions or new
pools of resources, but have increasingly put pressure on the
financing of existing obligations, efficient and effective
international institutions will continue to merit our financial
support. This strongly argues that the primary focus should be
support for existing international financial institutions and the
need to mobilize their resources more effectively.  It also means
that the needs which are identified must be consistent with the
magnitude and the specific nature of the resources available to
address them.<p>

     The existing complement of international institutions has
grown to a point where the international community would benefit
from a concerted effort to eliminate unnecessary overlap,
consolidate functions in the institutions that are most
effective, and focus on their activities more clearly on private
sector development, while continuing to play a vital role in
those areas where the private sector cannot or will not play a
role.  In the future, it will be beneficial to encourage the
emerging economies to assume a degree of global responsibility
which is broadly in line with their contribution to the world
economy.<p>

<b>4.  Economic Policy and Exchange Market Cooperation</b><p>

     Close consultation and effective cooperation on
macroeconomic policies among the G-7 are important elements in
promoting sustained non-inflationary growth, avoiding the
emergence of large external and internal imbalances, and
promoting greater exchange market stability.  We have adopted a
number of changes to the structure of our consultations  over
time in order to strengthen policy cooperation.  Specifically,
the process of consultation with the IMF has been enhanced and
the focus of discussions extended.  These changes are designed to
improve our capacity to identify, and better respond to,
potential risks.<p>

     Appropriate structural policies contribute to the
effectiveness of sound macroeconomic policies.  Structural
policies that increase the flexibility and dynamism of the supply
side of economies limit the persistence of macroeconomic
imbalances and accelerate the response to macroeconomic policy
adjustments.  Such policies also enhance the longer-term
potential of economies to grow and create secure, high-paying
jobs.<p>

     The most effective route to greater exchange market
stability lies in the pursuit of sound domestic monetary and
fiscal policies.  Further progress in achieving a non-
inflationary environment and reducing inflation differentials
will mitigate one important source of exchange rate variability. 
Further substantial progress in reducing fiscal deficits and
increasing national savings will also contribute to greater
exchange market stability.  Early policy action to avoid large
external imbalances would help reduce the likelihood of large and
potentially de-stabilizing exchange rate adjustments.<p>

     In addition, continued cooperation in the exchange markets
can be a useful and effective means for moderating exchange rate
movements that are not driven by fundamental changes in economic
conditions or policies.  Close monitoring and coordinated
responses in the exchange markets can be appropriate when
exchange rates get out of line.  In this context, it should be
noted that, in their April 25 Statement, the G-7 Finance
Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed that recent exchange
rate movements had "gone beyond the levels justified by
underlying economic conditions in the major countries.  They also
agreed to strengthen their efforts in reducing internal and
external imbalances and to continue to cooperate closely in
exchange markets."<p>

     Administrative measures, such as selective taxes or controls
on capital transactions, are an ineffective and very costly means
to attempt to limit exchange market volatility.  Since it would
be impractical to implement such controls across geographic areas
and financial instruments, they would merely shift the location
of activity or the financial vehicle for the transactions. 
Controls would also tend to hamper investment and capital flows
that are productive for growth and reinforce stability.<p>

<b>5.  Promoting Financial Stability in a Globalized
Economy</b><p>

     There is a need to ensure that the economic advantages made
possible by integrated, flexible financial markets can be enjoyed
around the world while, at the same time, more effectively
managing financial developments with potentially broad economic
implications.  In the past, this challenge has been met through a
network of institutions and arrangements, which include the IMF,
BI, G-7, G10, and OECD.  These groups have significantly
strengthened cooperation and information-sharing among policy
makers and financial market supervisors and regulators.  They
have also developed a complex set of formal and ad hoc financial
facilities that have been used to respond to financial market
crises which threatened to have major economic consequences.<p>

     The international community must also improve its ability to
address the risks inherent in the dramatic growth in private
financial flows, the increased integration of domestic capital
market, and greater recourse to financial innovations.  Episodes
of financial market distress, as most recently experienced in
Mexico, illustrate both the potential dangers and challenges
these institutions must be prepared to meet.<p>

     A number of interrelated elements are required to
effectively deal with these challenges:<p>

<ul>
<li>An improved early warning system is needed to avoid
financial shocks where possible.  This requires, inter alia, an
effective ongoing system of surveillance of national economic
policies and developments.<p>

<li>When potential problems are identified, there is a need to
ensure that the capacity exists to induce appropriate policy
responses at an early stage.<p>

<li>Appropriate and adequate multilateral financing mechanisms
are required that can, when needed be brought to bear on a scale
and with the timeliness required to overcome the consequences of
external shocks that may arise from the increased mobility of
international capital.  Crucially, there is a need to ensure that
these mechanisms operate in such a way, in terms of
conditionality, as to quickly restore market confidence and
access to private sector money.<p>

<li>An effective system of cooperation among industrial
countries and multilateral financial institutions is needed,
which allows a rapid and concerted response to external
shocks.<p>

<li>There may also be a need to look at other mechanisms that
might usefully be considered in situations of financial
crisis.<p></ul>

<b>Early Warning and Surveillance</b><p>

     Timely and comprehensive data are the backbone of an
effective surveillance process in the multilateral institutions. 
Properly constituted, surveillance serves three key functions: 
it provides the discipline needed to ensure that economic
developments are systematically reviewed by the multilateral
institutions and their implications clearly identified, it
provides an opportunity for governments to deliver collective
advice to one another with respect to economic policy measures
past or prospective, and it permits the private sector to make
informed decisions and perform its role more efficiently.<p>

     Minimizing the occurrence of financial shocks requires
improved transparency--i.e. that all counties publish timely and
reliable data on a broad range of economic and financial
indicators.  Quick and widespread access to such information will
allow financial markets to better perform their role as the
primary conduits by which capital moves from savers to borrowers.

Of particular importance is the role that continuous and
comprehensive data publication can play in minimizing the scope
of abrupt shifts in financial market sentiment in response to
unwelcome surprises.  Well-informed and well-functioning
financial markets are the best line of defence against financial
crises.  To this end, IMF should:<p><ul>

<li>establish benchmarks for the timely publication of key
economic and financial data;<p>

<li>establish a procedure for the regular public identification
of countries which comply with these benchmarks;<p>

<li>insist on full and timely reporting by member countries of
standard sets  of data.<p>
</ul>
    
G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors conduct
regular, detailed surveillance discussions, with the input of the
IMF, which are primarily focused on their own policies and
prospects.  More broadly-based surveillance is carried out by the
IMF in the context of its annual reviews of economic performance
in member countries.  The IMF also conducts broader assessments
of economic policies, developments, and prospects from a global
perspective in its World Economic outlook, which it publishes
twice a year.<p>

     Given its global mandate and the expertise of its staff, the
IMF should continue to be the focus of surveillance.  However,
the IMF's surveillance activities should be improved in four
specific ways:<p><ul>

<li>Greater resources and attention should be devoted to those
countries of global significance, including both industrial
countries and emerging economies.<p>

<li>Clear and direct policy advice should be offered to all
governments, particularly those which appear to be avoiding
necessary policy measures.<p>

<li>Greater attention should be devoted, in general, to
financial and banking sector developments and, in particular, to
the pattern of capital flows and their maturity.  Better balance
should also be achieved in the Fund's overall surveillance
process between cross-cutting issues, such as common developments
in capital markets, and country-specific issues.<p>

<li>Wherever feasible, the Fund should be more open and
transparent in its assessments and policy advice.<p></UL>

     Some of these objectives conflict, to some degree with one
another.  Most importantly, any surveillance process faces a
tension between the desire to function as a cooperative process
and the frequent need to deliver a sharp, unambiguous policy
message to national authorities.  In carrying out this task, the
IMF obviously needs to be selective.  In practice, this means
focusing particular attention on countries with a potentially
large impact on the world economy.<p>

     Should bilateral surveillance fail to achieve its desired
effect on the policies of certain member countries, a direct, but
private, dialogue with national authorities should be
encouraged.<p><ul>

<li>The IMF Managing Director should be invited to work more
closely with Executive Directors and when necessary, member
governments, with a view to initiating a concerted policy
dialogue with the national authorities of problem countries.<p>

<li>Where appropriate, governments should be prepared to take on
the role collectively or individually, of passing a strong
message on the need for policy actions to the national
authorities of these countries.<p></ul>

<b>Early and Appropriate Policy Responses</b><p>

     In a well-functioning system, a country would begin taking
policy actions to correct external or internal imbalances as soon
as these materialize.  The international financial institutions
are set up to facilitate this process in several ways.  The IMF,
for example, undertakes a regular process of consultations with
all member countries.  These consultations provide an opportunity
candidly review the current policy stance of members and discuss
prospective problems before these arise.<p>

The timing of such consultations should be flexible and
responsive to changes in country policies and the external
economic environment.<p>

     In cases where external financing is required to support
early policy actions, the Fund is able to provide financial
support through a variety of facilities.  These differ largely in
terms of the nature of the macroeconomic and structural problems
they seek to address and the degree of conditionality attached to
them.  The IMF and MDBs also provide significant financing for
structural reforms.  Such reform programs are designed to reduce
major economic distortions with a view to creating more dynamic
economies, which are better able to cope with external shocks
should they arise in the future.<p>


<b>Financing Mechanisms</b><p>

     The international community's ability to respond to short-
term liquidity needs and medium-term balance of payments
difficulties in individual countries is centered principally on
two institutions, the IMF and the BIS.  At times these have been
supplemented by ad hoc bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. 
The IMF has at its disposal a number of financing facilities,
each of which generally requires the negotiation of an acceptable
economic policy program as a prelude to disbursement of loans
which, in turn, are predicted on the fulfillment of the agree
policy commitments and targets.<p>

     Should the financial need of one or more member economies be
sufficiently large to strain the IMF's regular resources or
threaten the functioning of the international financial system,
the G-10 countries stand ready to provide loans to the IMF
through the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB).  To bridge the
gap between the urgent liquidity needs that often arise in a time
of crisis and the weeks or months that may be required for the
IMF to begin disbursing its loans, the monetary authorities of
the G-10 countries have found it necessary on occasion to extend
short-term credits either directly or through the BIS.<p>

     A key question should be what constitutes the right mix of
surveillance, adjustment and financing--rather than viewing the
crisis as the consequence of inadequate financing.  The Mexican
crisis clearly illustrates that the vast financial flows that are
now commonplace in private markets pose important new challenges.

It also illustrates the importance of strong policy action in
responding to such crises, and the crucial need for any financial
support to be conditional on that.  While this episode points to
a need to review both the size and the speed of access to the
financing mechanisms.  It is also understood that there can be no
presumption that multilateral financing will be provided in every
instance of local or regional financial crisis.<p>

     The episode also highlights the necessity for international
financial institutions and major economies to be able to respond
rapidly and in a well coordinated fashion, when confronted with a
problem that could have adverse economic consequences for a
significant number of countries or pose a significant threat to
the stability of the world's increasingly integrated financial
system.<p>

     Issues pertaining to financing mechanisms can be identified
in terms of the means by which funds can be made available and
the sources of such funds.  The IMF's facilities continue to
represent an important source of financing for macroeconomic
stabilization in many countries.  Moreover, an IMF arrangement is
an essential element for any agreement with the BIS and creditor
governments on a short-term bridging facility.  In the aftermath
of Mexico, attention might usefully be focused on the adequacy of
the Fund's current mechanisms (including use of the "exceptional
circumstances" clause on a selective and ad hoc basis).<p><ul>

<li>We would propose the establishment within the IMF of a new
standing procedure--"Emergency Financing Mechanism"--involving a
fund arrangement with strong conditionality but with high up-
front access and faster procedures to access Fund resources in
crisis situations under the "exceptional circumstances"
clause.<p></ul>

     The IMF presently has adequate useable resources to finance
its commitments to Mexico and other projected lending without a
significant increase in its liquidity.  Nevertheless, in order to
support the above-mentioned new standing procedure, we would
ask<p><ul>

<li>that the G-10 and other countries with the capacity to
support the system develop financing arrangements with the
objective of doubling as soon as possible the amount currently
available under the GAB to respond to financial
emergencies;<p></ul>

     To ensure that the IMF has sufficient resources to meet its
ongoing responsibilities, we urge continued discussions on a new
IMF quota review.<p>

<b>Strengthening International Cooperation</b><p>

     Should financial market crises arise, it is important that
we improve existing mechanisms for sharing our analyses and
strengthen our ability to coordinate a quick response.  A
willingness to cooperate is obviously essential but this must be
backed up by fast and reliable channels of communications at all
levels of operational responsibility.<p>

     In essence, the methods of coordination and cooperation
among the major industrialized economies and the multilateral
financial institutions must be modernized and brought into line
with the growing speed and breadth of financial market
integration.  Since these groups have at their disposal the same
information technology that markets have exploited, further
improvements in these capabilities appear both feasible and
desirable.<p>

     Solid progress on the element discussed above should
significantly improve the international community's ability to
cope with future financial crises.  Nevertheless, these
improvements may not be sufficient in all cases.  In line with
this, and recognizing the complex legal and other issues posed in
debt crisis situations by the wide variety of sources of
international finance involved, we would encourage further review
by G-10 Ministers and Governors of other procedures that might
also usefully be considered for their orderly resolution.<p>

<b>6.  Strengthening Financial Market Supervision and
Regulation</b><p>

     The growth of financial markets, the development of new
instruments, and a desire for diversification of investment have
spurred global integration of national markets and increased
liquidity.  These developments have led to a more efficient
allocation of capital and thus greater growth of economic
activity.  At the same time, with today's highly integrated
financial markets, there is a greater potential for the rapid
transmission of financial disturbances.  Close international
cooperation in the regulation and supervision of financial
institutions and markets is essential to the continued
safeguarding of the financial system and to prevent erosion of
necessary prudential standards.<p>

     Continued strengthening of these efforts has the full
support of G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Banks Governors.  We
look forward to the development and further enhancement of
concrete international understandings, where necessary and
appropriate, on the safeguards, standards, transparency, and
systems necessary to reduce potential risks.  In this context, we
recognize the important initiatives being undertaken separately
and jointly by various communities under the aegis of the BIS and
the International Organization of Securities Commissions as well
as by national authorities:<p><ul>

<li>The G-10 should be encouraged to intensify their review of
work in this area and there should be a call for the Basic
Committee on Banking Supervision and the Intentional Organization
of Securities Commissions to work closely together in addressing
the major issues in this area and the desirable steps to address
identified problems and to report back.  These reports should
help Ministers to reach conclusions regarding the extent of
systemic risks and their implications for the economy, and the
need for any measures deemed essential to an integrated approach
to potential systemic risks.<p>

<li>The IMF should consider extending existing obligations
regarding the convertibility of current account transactions to
the staged liberalization of capital account transactions.  At
the same time, the IMF, the World Bank and regional development
banks, and national authorities should encourage an integrated
approach to ensure that adequate authorities should encourage an
integrated approach to ensure that adequate supervisory,
regulatory and policy structures are in place to support the
sound development of financial markets in countries which are
removing these restrictions.  This might be done, for example, by
increasing technical assistance and strengthening contacts with
other regulatory authorities.<p></ul>

     We also recognize that international financial fraud is a
growing problem.  We are committed to improve communication
between regulators and law enforcement agencies.<p>


<b>7.  Special Drawing Rights</b><p><ul>

<li>We reiterate our support for a one-time special allocation
of SDRs, through an amendment of the fund's Articles of
Agreement, to reduce inequities in the current system by allowing
new members, particularly the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, to participate fully in the
SDR system.  This approach would also provide additional SDRs to
other countries, particularly the poorest countries with the
greatest need.  The broader question of the appropriate future
role of the SDR in the international monetary system should be
the subject of a separate study as agreed at the last meeting of
the Interim Committee.<p></ul>

<b>8.  Sustainable Development</b><p>

     The multilateral development banks--i.e. the World Bank and
regional development banks--must continue to play a key role in
the promotion of sustainable development.  In recent years, the
MDBs have been broadly responsive to emerging challenges and have
adopted an impressive set of operational and administrative
reforms.  This is most clearly evident in their ongoing response
to the historic challenge of transforming the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from
centrally-planned to market-based economies.<p>

     The MDBs have also learned valuable lessons from past
successes and failures, which provide clear evidence of the
complexity of the developmental challenge.  The international
community has a shared interest to ensure that these institutions
continue to adapt to the challenges of today's world and
contribute efficiently tot he development process of poor
countries.  In line with this, the following areas deserve closer
examination.<p>

<b>Allocating Resources More Effectively</b><p>

     Greater attention needs to be paid to the use of
increasingly scarce public resources.  Budget constraints in many
donor countries are leading to growing pressures on confessional
programs.  As a result, priorities must be sharpened and
difficult choices made concerning both the sectoral and country
focus of assistance efforts and we reaffirm our support to the
MDBs' endeavor in this regard.<p><ul>

<li>It is essential that the MDBs narrow their focus and
increasingly direct their lending toward the provision of
"public" goods, for which private support is inadequate or simply
not available.  This argues for a stronger focus on programs such
as those which support primary education and health care or
protection of the environment.  Such investments are not only
economically sound, but typically demonstrate exceptionally high
social rates of return as well.<p>

<li>Wherever feasible, traditional lending for capital projects
should be left to the private sector and more generally, the MDBs
should ensure that their lending is genuinely additional to
private sector finance, and not replacing it.  In order to
promote private involvement in the development process, the MDBs
should:  encourage private sector financing of capital projects
through various financing mechanisms; encourage the development
of a healthy private sector by establishing a policy environment
conducive to private enterprise; and support the provision of
sufficient infrastructure for sustainable growth.<p>

<li>Concessional resources should be allocated primarily to the
countries that need them most and have a demonstrated capacity to
use them effectively.  Countries with sustained and growing
access to capital markets should be progressively "graduated"
from the confessional to the ordinary capital windows of these
institutions.<p>

<li>In line with our objective of supporting efficient and
effective multilateral institutions, we urge all donor countries
to fulfil promptly their commitments to IDA 10 and to support a
significant replenishment of IDA 11.<p></ul>

<b>Future Policy Directions</b><p>

     A number of key development challenges have their root
causes in poverty.  The international development institutions
clearly have an essential role to play in reducing poverty
through direct interventions and the promotion of sustainable,
labor-intensive growth.<p><ul>

<li>To better play this role, the country strategies of the Mobs
need to be more clearly driven by the poverty reduction
strategies of recipient countries.s  In turn, country strategies
should include clear statements of expected progress on key
poverty indicators and provide monitorable benchmark to better
judge the success of individual projects.<p>

<li>The MDBs should also give serious consideration to sharply
reducing their lending programs in any country that does not
clearly demonstrate a firm commitment to poverty reduction.  In
some case, this commitment might be assessed against the share of
government spending directed to basic social services compared to
the share directed to non-productive areas, such as military
spending.<p></ul>

     The MDBs have responded well to the challenges of
integrating sound environmental principles into their operational
policies.  Nevertheless, there continues to be concern about the
implementation of these policies. This being the case:<p><ul>

<li>Comprehensive environmental assessments should be an
integral part of the program and project development process and
mitigative actions taken as appropriate.  Greater attention
should also be paid to the environmental impacts of completed
projects.  Full consultation with relevant parties should be
undertaken at various stages of the project cycle.<p></ul>

     There is also considerable public skepticism about the
overall quality of MDB projects and whether the Mobs are
contributing to effective development, particularly in regions
such as sub-Saharan Africa.  Clearly, there is a need to better
demonstrate results "on the ground" and to continue to press for
higher quality projects.<p><ul>

<li>One way to achieve this would be the institutions to take
better account of the lessons of experience from their past
successes and failures.  It would be useful to examine the
possibility of introducing common standards and criteria for
evaluation across these various institutions.  This would not
only help improve the exchange of information, but would ensure
the consistency of project and program evaluations across
different institutions.  We would also encourage the IMF to
establish its own independent evaluation unit.<p></ul>

     Development effectiveness can also be improved through
efforts to strengthen policy coordination.  While the traditional
division of labor between the IMF and the World Bank makes good
sense, operations would be improved if joint missions and program
preparation were the norm both in areas of shared responsibility,
such as financial sector reform and budget exercises and where
macroeconomic and structural issues interact.<p><ul>

<li>For countries which are drawing on the resources of the
Fund, efforts should be made to operationalize a more integrated
approach.  Where appropriate,the use of common policy framework
papers should be encouraged.<p>

<li>Scope may also exist to improve coordination between the
World Bank and the RDBs, with each focusing on their core
missions and through stronger cooperation where these intersect. 
The Development Committee Task Force might explore the scope for
improved consultation on respective country programs with a view
to a clearer division of the sectoral responsibilities of these
institutions in individual member countries.<p>

<li>The World Bank and the regional development banks should be
encouraged to decentralize their operations wherever possible.<p>

<li>The activities of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
must be more strongly integrated into the World Bank
Group.<p></ul>

     Looking ahead the Mobs will need to do more to better
customize their services to meet the changing needs of many of
their borrowing members.  A key challenge will be to continue to
increase the capacity of the private sector to provide services
which in most countries, have previously been provided by
governments.<p><ul>

<li>To catalyze greater private sector participation, the World
Bank has introduced a new guarantee program which is aimed, in
particular, at leveraging additional private flows for
infrastructure investment...  In the same vein, the world Bank
and RDBs should work actively to expand their co-financing
arrangements with private and public financial institutions.<p>

<li>To catalyze great private sector flows, while assuring
adequate risk sharing among public and private leaders, the world
Bank Group should be encouraged to examine new public-private
institutional arrangements which might better support the
organization of private-led financial packages.<p></ul>

     Turning to debt, considerable progress has been made on the
international debt strategy at recent Summits.  Nevertheless,
significant debt overhang problems clearly persist in a number of
the poorest countries.  Last December, as called for at the
Naples Summit, the Paris Club of creditor governments agreed to
increase the level of debt reduction to (up to) 67 percent for
the most severely-indebted, low-income countries and to
operationalize a"stock of debt" approach.  We welcome the Paris
Club's progress to improve the treatment of the debt of these
countries and urge the full and constructive implementation of
Naples terms, a step that is in the interest of both debtors and
creditors<p><ul>

<li>To address the overall debt burdens of these countries in a
comprehensive manner, a coordinated approach should be maintained
to official bilateral, commercial, and multilateral debt, and
special attention should be paid to the prevention of future debt
problems.<p>

<li>Further study on a country-by-country basis needs to be made
of the extent and nature (by institution and type of debt) of the
problems faced, in order to determine where innovative approaches
are most appropriate.<p></ul>

     There is general agreement that measures have to be taken to
ensure the burden of multilateral debt doest not impede the
growth prospects for the poorest countries.  Exit strategies need
to be found for countries with particularly high levels of
multilateral debt, but with good track records.<p><ul>

<li>The IMF and World Bank should take the lead in developing a
comprehensive multilateral approach to assist countries with
multilateral debt and debt-service ratios above prudent levels in
addressing their debt burdens, through the flexible
implementation of existing instruments and new mechanisms where
necessary.<p>

<li>Thought should be given to the better use of all existing
IMF and World Bank resources and further consideration of
appropriate measures in the multilateral development banks, to
advance this objective.<p>

<li>An important part of any resolution of these debt problems
will be the availability of financing on more highly confessional
or grant terms.  Thought also should be given to increasing the
share of official bilateral assistance directed to the poorest
countries and the degree of concessionality in such assistance. 
<p></ul>

     Disasters and other crises have demonstrated gaps in the
institutional machinery. To help resolve emerging crises, the
Bretton Woods institutions and the UN should establish a new
coordination procedure, supported as necessary by existing
resources, to facilitate a smooth transition to the
rehabilitation phase in countries emerging from economic and
political crisis, and to cooperate more effectively with donor
countries.<p>

<b>Strengthening Governance and Management</b><p>

     A number of key governance mechanisms of the international
system have become less effective in recent years.  There is a
clear need to redesign and refocus a number of these mechanisms
if they are to have a more meaningful role.<p>

     Consideration might be given to two options to reinvigorate
the Interim and Development Committees.  The first option could
be to create a new forum with a broader mandate than the current
Interim and Development Committees.  Under this option, the
Interim and Development Committees could be reconstituted into a
single joint Fund-Bank Committee to focus on global financial and
development policy issues.<p>

     An alternative option might be to transform the Development
Committee into a more effective policy steering committee with a
relationship to the World Bank Group analogous to that of the
Interim Committee to the IMF.  Under both cases, it could be
recommended that Ministerial attendance be limited to the Annual
meetings.  Discussions at the Spring meetings could then be at
the level of senior officials.<p>

     The time has also come for international financial
institutions to better prioritized their activities.  In
particular, these institutions need to actively address the
growing overlap and unnecessary duplication of many of their
activities.  Not only would policy actions in this area yield
welcome savings, but they could also contribute to greater policy
coherence throughout the IF system.<p><ul>

<li>There appears to be scope to reduce overlap in the area of
macroeconomic surveillance.  In this area, the IMF and the ACCEDE
have sometimes come to perform similar surveillance.  The ACCEDE
should give relative priority to structural issues without
neglecting its traditional macroeconomic studies, which are
necessary to enable sound evaluation of structural policies. 
These studies could focus more on medium term prospects.<p></ul>

     Finally, there is a need for these institutions to clearly
demonstrate their commitment to cost effectiveness.<p><ul>

<li>In line with this, those institutions which have already
begun to formulate and implement plans to effect significant
reductions in their operating costs should be encouraged in their
work.  Those institutions yet to begin such a process should be
urged to do so during upcoming budget exercises with a view to
achieving measurable results over the next few years.<p></ul>

     Such plans could help to reinforce the pressure on many of
these institutions to better prioritized their activities.  It
should also be stressed that these savings need not necessarily
come at a cost to the services that are provided to borrowing
members, if this leads to the creation of leaner and "smarter"
institutions.<p>


<b>9.  Other Institutions and Issues</b><p>

     The broader Halifax process will also need to review the
coherence of the overall system of international institutions. 
The international community has a strong interest in eliminating
duplication between the Ibis and the UN system and operating
these institutions on as cost effective a basis as possible.<p>

     Attention also needs to be paid to the synergies, as well as
potential overlap, between the world Trade Organization and the
various trade-related activities of other international
institutions.<p><ul>

<li>The WHO needs to become a strong force for open markets and
the continued liberalization of world trade.  To ensure that is
has a credible leadership role, it will be essential that the
Who activities are closely coordinated with the IMF, world
Bank, ACCEDE, and trade-related UN bodies to avoid unnecessary
duplication in their activities.</ul>

<p>DHAHRAN BOMB ATTACK:<br>
'A STRIKE AGAINST U.S. INFLUENCE'</H3></center>
<p>
<p>
The bomb attack that left a wake of death and destruction in the U.S.
military complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, topped all electronic and print
coverage around the world, with most commentators stressing that it
represents both a challenge to "U.S. influence in the region" and to the
Saudi ruling family.  One other target frequently cited was the Middle
East peace process itself, with analysts pointing to Secretary
Christopher's mission in the region to buttress this argument.  The
independent, centrist Jordan Times concluded, "We believe that the peace
process in the  Middle East, and the regional order that is emerging as a
result of its  progress and development, is the real target of the two
acts."   In Israel, pluralist, independent Maariv asserted, instead, that
the attack:  "lends extra weight to Prime Minister Netanyahu's argument
that combatting terror transcends all other issues."  Moscow's reformist,
youth Komsomolskaya Pravda held, "Moscow was right...in that by putting
pressure on Arabs, while supporting Israel, Washington was courting big
trouble."
 
Observers sharply disagreed as to who might be responsible for the blast. 
Many argued that it was "home grown" terrorism directed at the
"feudalistic" rulers of Saudi Arabia.  Others, however, saw the hand of
Iran or other terrorist states behind the tragedy.   The conservative
Daily Telegraph of London insisted that Iran must be "isolated," since its
"shadow hangs over all Western allies in the region."   Tehran TV aired
Iran's foreign minister's vehement denials of these charges.  Journalists
also differed over what the law-abiding nations could do against
terrorism, although most concluded that the U.S. would not withdraw from
Saudi Arabia, as it did from Lebanon during the Reagan years.    Finally,
pundits speculated as to how the death of American soldiers would affect
President Clinton during an election year.  "This (attack)," Paris's
influential Le Monde concluded, "limits the U.S. president's  room for
diplomatic maneuver, at a time when he needs it (most) in the  Middle
East."<p>

        G-7 SUMMIT:  A VARIED AGENDA; QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS<p>
                                       
As the 22nd G-7 summit begins today in Lyon, France, scenesetters posed
the usual questions the annual get-together seems to generate:  What
should be the focus of the summit agenda; should  G-7 summitry be
reformed; are the pronouncements by the G-7 useful and effective?  Some
analysts reviewed the history of the G-7, begun in the 1970s as a response
to the worldwide recession, and urged the industrialized countries to
refocus on economics. One trade issue sure to loom large, some writers
said, will be U.S. trade sanctions policy--particularly as spelled out in
the Helms-Burton Act.  However, opinionmakers held that other issues will
probably dominate the agenda, with several noting the announcement by
President Clinton that he will push action against international terrorism
as the top issue in the wake of the bombing of the American military
complex in Saudi Arabia.  Some media focused on U.S.-European
confrontation inside the G-7.  The absence of Russian President Yeltsin
was the focus in Moscow papers.<p>

BRIEF
   --  Secretary Christopher In The Middle East<p>

EDITORS:  Mildred Sola Neely and Diana McCaffrey<p>


          DHAHRAN BOMB ATTACK:  'A STRIKE AGAINST U.S. INFLUENCE'<p>
                                       
BAHRAIN:  "Criminal Act Against Innocent Civilians And Military Men"<p>

Leading, semi-official Akhbar Al-Khalij (6/27) opined, "The criminal act
was directed against innocent civilians and military  men. And when we say
innocent military men, we mean what we say.  It is not magnanimity nor
heroism attacking military men in their houses away from  the
battlefields.  Not saying that those military men came according to a
bilateral agreement between two countries which have complete independence
and will to decide issues of mutual interests....  The Al-Khobar terrorist
and cowardly operation was not directed against the Americans as much as
it  was against the security of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf region and the
entire Arab nation.  It is also directed against the moderate policies in
the  region."    <p>

ISRAEL:  "Saudi Attack Lends Weight Netanyahu's Argument" <p>

Pluralist, independent Maariv's editorial asserted (6/27),  "The fatal
terror attack in Dhahran lends extra weight to Prime Minister Netanyahu's
argument that combatting terror transcends all other issues and that Syria
is no less a terror sponsoring nation than Iran.  The war on Islamic
terror is a goal common to all civilized nations.  And it's a war that
must be waged immediately, before Muslim radicals get hold of nuclear
weapons."<p>

JORDAN:  "Share Of Responsibility"
  
Columnist Fahed Fanek stressed in pro-government, influential, Arabic-
language Al-Ray (6/27), "America has the right to be angry and call the
doers terrorists....  We  are not looking for an excuse for killing and
violence, but we request  that all parties bear their share of the
responsibility.  Why does the  United States keep tens of thousands of its
soldiers in Saudi Arabia when it knows  that they are not wanted by the
people there?  If the target is to  control Arab oil, then they will have
to pay in American blood....  We  are against anything that puts the
stability of our sister country in danger, but it is more appropriate to
give people the opportunity to express themselves in a more civilized way
and we wonder why people use  explosives instead of ballots."  
    
"Real Target:  Middle East Peace Process"<p>

The independent, centrist, English-language Jordan Times (6/27) concluded,
"We believe that the peace process in the  Middle East, and the regional
order that is emerging as a result of its  progress and development, is
the real target of the two acts."  <p>

GERMANY:  "Democracy, Market Economy"<p>

Siegfried Buschschlueter commented on national radio station
Deutschlandfunk of Cologne (6/26): "What the government in Washington is
demanding from  the Russian government--democracy and market economy--
should also be a demand for the Gulf states.  It should do this quickly,
since the  disintegration of the formerly rich feudalistic oil states
could result  in shake-ups that could have more disastrous consequences
than  yesterday's detonation of the murderous car bomb." <p>

"Election Year Question"<p>

In the view of Jochen Winter in an editorial in left-of-center Frankfurter
Rundschau (6/27), "The United States is paying a dear price for its global
policy and  military engagement.  The attack in Saudi Arabia is not the
first and  will certainly not be the last terrorist attack against U.S.
soldiers and  their families....  Even though the U.S. government has now
said that it will not  give in to terrorism and promised to pursue the
attackers until they have  been caught, many Americans will wonder why
their sons and daughters have  to die in remote countries in which <p>

there is not even the slightest touch  of democracy.  But this is an
election year in the United States, and this is why  Bill Clinton and his
challenger Bob Dole must address this question.  But  it is likely that
the United States will maintain its engagement in the Saudi Arabia."<p>

"A Strike Against U.S. Influence"<p>

Left-of-center Berliner Zeitung (6/27) judged in an editorial by Martina
Doehring, "This terrorist attack is also a strike against the influence of
the  United States in the region....  With great perseverance the United
States  has tried over the past several years to bring quiet and stability
to the  region which is so important for the strategic and economic
interests of  the West....  So far, these successes have been considered
trump cards  in Bill Clinton's election campaign....  But the Middle East
peace  process has bogged down, the problems with Iraq are unresolved,
Iran continues to create trouble and there is unrest in the Gulf states. 
Not  only Bill Clinton's re-election is in jeopardy, but in the long run
also  the U.S. role in the region." <p>

"Target:  Peace Process"<p>

Centrist Der Tagesspiegel of Berlin (6/27) concluded, "It was not a
coincidence that the attack in Saudi Arabia took place  during Warren
Christopher's trip to the Middle East.  The allegedly  Islamic attackers
also wanted to hit the peace process."<p>

BRITAIN:  "Saudi Arabia Key To U.S. Position In Region" <p>

An editorial in the conservative Daily Telegraph commented (6/27): "For
all the comparisons with the bombings of the U.S. Marine barracks and
embassy in Beirut in the mid-1980s, this is one commitment from which no
American government could be seen to retreat.  To do so would encourage
worldwide terrorism against its personnel and installations.  Saudi Arabia
is the key to the American position in the region....<p>

"But whoever did it, Western policy should be based on three constants:
First, that for all its faults, the House of Saud remains the best option
available.  Second, that the Western powers should not be panicked into
precipitate action: although the domestic opposition, of various stripes,
has become bolder, the regime's problems are still light years away from
those of Algeria just before large-scale violence broke out there.  And
third, none of this should preclude Western governments from quietly
urging the Saudis to adopt a cautiously reformist program to introduce
greater political pluralism, of the kind initiated by King Hussein in
Jordan. <p>

"Even if it turns out that indigenous Saudi groups were solely to blame,
none of this removes the need for European nations to do more to combat
the menace of Iran, whose shadow hangs over all Western allies in the
region.  Iran needs to be isolated: it must become a pariah permitted to
talk and do business only with other rogue states, such as North Korea. 
The policy of 'critical dialogue," pushed by the EU, has served only to
convince Iran that Western Europe puts commercial interests ahead of
security needs."<p>

"Focus Anti-Terrorism Efforts In Region"
 
According to the conservative Times (6/27), "Lyons is not where America
needs to concentrate its efforts (against terrorism).  The main need is to
coordinate a more effective regional response to Islamist extremism.  The
bombing has been as firmly condemned by Syria's President, Hafez Assad,
and by Yasser Arafat as by America's traditional allies in the Middle
East.  They must be assumed to be sincere; instability in Saudi Arabia
unsettles the entire region, to the profit only of Iraq and Iran.  This
atrocity should therefore assist the American drive...to convince Arab
governments and security forces that terrorism is their common enemy."<p>

<p>

<p>

"Home Grown Saudi Affair" <p>

Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk wrote for the centrist Independent
(6/27): "Yesterday, Middle East experts were producing their usual
theories of an international Muslim conspiracy....  If only it was that
simple.  Iran's religious leaders will feel no pity for the Americans, but
the chances are that yesterday's bombing was a home-grown Saudi affair, a
new phase in the most violent internal opposition ever to confront the
House of Saud and its Western supporters." <p>

FRANCE:   "Iranian Connection?"<p>

Private, influential TV TF-1 and public France 2-TV (6/26) hinted at 
Iranian connections.  <p>

"No U.S. Disengagement, On The Contrary"<p>

Jacques Malmassari said in an editorial in influential Liberation (6/27):
"For Washington, protecting the Saudi regime is (a) strategic imperative. 
The U.S. energy policy and, to some extent, its arms  industry depend on
it.  The collapse of the Saudi kingdom, which would  weaken the entire
Gulf region, would be a success for Washington's two  bete noires, Iran
and Iraq.  Also, it would represent a threat to Israel.   This is why one
should not expect the United States to disengage itself from  Saudi
Arabia.  On the contrary, Washington will reaffirm its  interests....  All
the more so since the entire Middle East region may  enter an era of
severe turbulence and increased terrorism if, as one  might fear, the
intransigence of the new Israeli leaders amounts to a  betrayal of
moderate, realistic Arab leaders." <p>

"Limits Clinton's Room For Maneuver"<p>

Influential Le Monde's (6/27) correspondent in the Gulf region Mouna Naim
filed, "This attack represents a risk for Bill Clinton, that of reminding 
voters that this administration, which was elected in 1992 to focus on 
domestic policy, has had to commit itself on multiple fronts abroad and 
that this commitment, in Bosnia or in the Gulf, represents a danger for
U.S. troops involved....  This (attack) limits the U.S. president's  room
for diplomatic maneuver, at a time when he needs it (most) in the  Middle
East." <p>

RUSSIA:  "U.S. Troops To Stay" <p>

Vladimir Dunayev said in reformist Segodnya (6/27): "Washington does not
intend to withdraw its troops from that strategic region." <p>

"More To Come" <p>

Dmitry Kulik filed from Damascus for reformist, youth Komsomolskaya Pravda
(6/27): "The Arab summit in Cairo might provide an impulse for those
seeking to unite the Middle East under the green banner of Islam.  For
them, Israel and the West, primarily the United States are an impediment. 
Evidently, this terrorist act, alas, won't be the last one this year.... 
Many Arabs feel uncomfortable seeing U.S., French and British troops
'trample on the holy places' in the home-land of Islam.  It was not for
nothing that the blast coincided with Warren Christopher's visit to that
region....  The summit in Egypt gave Netanyahu time to think and soften
his stand.  Radicals decided they could not afford that and struck at the
Israelis' ally, the Americans.  The U.S. secretary of state did not listen
when his Russian counterpart warned that a half-hearted decision on the
Lebanon-Israel conflict would not bring peace.  As long as Israel remains
an occupying force, the guerrilla war will continue.  Moscow was right
also in that by putting pressure on Arabs, while supporting Israel,
Washington was courting big trouble."<p>

<p>

<p>

ITALY:  "The West Should Move Together"<p>

Former Under Secretary of Defense  Stefano Silvestri observed in leading
financial Il Sole-24 Ore  (6/27): "This is not the first terrorist attack
against the Western  military presence in Saudi Arabia, but certainly it
is part of a series of moves aimed at destabilizing Arab nations in the
Gulf and penalizing  pro-Western choices: A policy approved and often
encouraged by Iran.   Unfortunately these local threats are part of a more
general problem,  that of U.S. policy toward the countries indicated as
sponsors of  terrorism, mainly Iran and Libya.  That policy has always
been  characterized by very tough positions as well as concrete threats,
but it  now may grow even tougher because of the atmosphere around the
U.S.  presidential elections.  A substantial part of Congress (and of the 
Republican Party, but not only) seems tempted by unilateral choices which 
have a strong hold on public opinion, but which may have serious 
repercussions internationally, such as the Helms-Burton act....<p>

"There are  far more reasonable ways to go.  For example, one could begin
from the  declaration signed in Cairo by the leaders of an overwhelming
majority of  Arab nations (including Syria and Libya) which condemns `all
forms of  terrorism and acts of sabotage and destruction....'  One cannot
deny that,  if nothing else, they indicate at least a possible and ample
area of  understanding and cooperation which it would be absurd and 
counterproductive to ignore, and which could be much more useful against 
terrorism than rash unilateral moves." <p>

THE NETHERLANDS:  "A Threat To Saudi Royal Family"<p>

Influential liberal left  De Volkskrant (6/27) commented, "The attacks in
Saudi Arabia are not only aimed at the American presence  in the Kingdom
and the close political and military ties with the 'big  satan', but they
are also aimed at the regime of King Fahd... It is a regime which does not
tolerate public participation, does not have a parliament, and which
forbids political parties; it is also accused of deviating from  the
Islamic path and having sold its skin to the West.... Corruption and
nepotism are a thorn  in many a Saudi eye... Muslim militants complain
that the thousands of princes live above the  law and ignore Islamic
rules."  <p>

TURKEY:  "Countries Which Support Terrorism Must Pay Price" <p>

Extensive coverage today and last night on TV and the printed press
included 
this column by Hasan Cemal on page one of mass-appeal Sabah (6/27), "If
cooperation against terrorism will not just continue to be rhetorical
following the bombing in Dhahran, then it must be demonstrated in concrete
ways that countries in the region which support terrorism must pay the
price in one way or another.  Otherwise it is impossible to break the
influence of those who dance with terrorism for their political ends.... 
In deploring the attack yesterday President Clinton named Iran and Iraq
but failed to mention Syria.  I wonder why?" <p>

IRAN:  "We Strongly Reject Any Kind Of Involvement In Dhahran
Explosion"<p>

Tehran IRIB television in Persian said (6/26), "Following a joint meeting,
Weizman, the President of the Zionist regime, and U.S. Secretary of State
Christopher accused the Islamic Republic of Iran of involvement in the
Dhahran explosion.   Responding to the accusations, our country's foreign
ministry spokesman today called Weizman and Christopher two ringleaders
and supporters of state terrorism, and rejected their accusations against
Iran.    Mr. Mahmud Mohammadi said America and the Zionist regime are busy
hatching a joint plot aimed at damaging the reputation of the Islamic
Republic of Iran.  He said: blaming Iran for such actions has roots in
America's and Israel's joint hostility against Islam and the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and we strongly reject any kind of involvement in the
Dhahran explosion.    The foreign ministry spokesman added: it seems that
suspicious efforts are under way to strengthen the climate of mistrust in
the region, aimed at paving the way for expanding the Zionist regime's
influence in the region's political, economic, and security structures.
<p>


"We hope that regional countries will vigilantly block the destructive
policies of America and Israel, aimed at creating rifts among Islamic and
Arab countries in the region." <p>

PAKISTAN:   "U.S.:  Obvious Target Of Hate"<p>

An editorial in Islamabad's centrist News (6/27) commented, "The bomb
blast...has to be seen in the context of Washington's policy in the Middle
East.  The Gulf was has long ended but the American troops have stayed
behind....  There is every likelihood that the anger against the Americans
and their troops in Saudi Arabia could have found expression in this
extreme and sad form.  Moreover the Americans have not popularised
themselves in the region by their neurotic obsession with fundamentalism. 
Their support to Hosni Mubarak and their clearly articulated pledges to
blunt the cutting edge of fundamentalist Islam has made anything
associated with them an obvious target of hate." <p>

INDONESIA:  "Who Was Real Target Of Bombing In Saudi Arabia?"<p>

Leading independent Kompas (6/27) declared, "Let the FBI find out who was
behind the bombing.  Regardless of their findings, it is clear that U.S.
interests in Saudi Arabia have become a target.  We can only say that the
people behind the bombing were desperate and bold, risking beheading like
those behind the November bombing....That case was deemed political, as
some felt that the Saudi kingdom had become too close to the U.S....  We
hope the incident will not affect stability in Saudi Arabia, as it is the
only Arab country which has so far taken a moderate stance on the Middle
East issue."<p>

THAILAND:  "Saudi Bomb Spotlights Continued Terror Risk" <p>

The lead editorial of largest circulation, English-language Bangkok  Post
(6/27), strongly condemned the Saudi Arabia truck bombing in the following
editorial:  "In recent times, the car and truck bomb have become a weapon 
throughout the world.  Far from being a weapon of war, these are weapons
against peace.  They are not used by soldiers, but by cowards.  They do 
not terrorize regimes or governments, but only peaceful citizens.  There
are those who will excuse the Dhahran bombing on the basis that most of 
the victims were American servicemen.  This is beside the point.  The 
victims were asleep or at rest, and their duties were not in any way aimed
against Saudi citizens.  Most of those killed or wounded were  involved in
UN and allied efforts to keep the peace in Iraq.   The argument that Saudi
Arabia somehow makes such acts inevitable by its  harsh laws against
internal dissent is equally specious...  The battle  against terrorism
must proceed across borders and must be universal.   Civic, political and
religious leaders have a duty to condemn all  terrorism.  Ends do not
justify the means.  Even the high ideals of a  group do not excuse use of
random and deadly violence against the  innocent"<p>

ARGENTINA:  "The New Logic Of Terror: An Attack With Domestic Roots"<p>

Left-of-center Pagina 12 (6/26) opined, "Like in Lebanon,  there is in
Saudi Arabia a growing Islamic fundamentalist opposition which rejects the
presence of foreign troops--particularly from the  U.S.--and that wish for
an 'Islamization' of life in the country. But  in this case, there are new
ingredients.  Saudi Arabia, main oil producer and exporter, is really a
double-fronted state: Outwardly it is decidedly pro-West and pro-U.S.;
inwardly it is a  closed monarchy, dictatorial and corrupt, in which the
secret police and censorship rule, there is no democratic or semi-
democratic instance and  the Muslim and theocratic faith coexists
uncomfortably with the, literally, pharaonic and squandering lifestyle of
the ruling class....  One would be tempted to ascribe this attack--like
yesterday's -- to an  'Iranian connection', due to the severe opposition
the Saudi monarchy has  consistently maintained against any kind of
expansion of Khomeinism and  Fundamentalism in the area.... 
Unfortunately...the explosions seem to have more domestic origins." <p>

<p>


        G-7 SUMMIT:  A VARIED AGENDA; QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS<p>
                                       
FRANCE:  "Lyon Air Will Reinvigorate Clinton"<p>

Washington correspondent Stephane Marchand asserted in conservative Le 
Figaro (6/27),  "Five months prior to the presidential election, the Lyon
air will  reinvigorate Bill Clinton.  Thousands of kilometers away from
White House  scandals, far from the Republican Congress, he will claim
credit for the excellent performance of the U.S. economy....  In order to
prevent Bill  Clinton from imposing himself as a star at the summit,
Jacques Chirac  intends to criticize the U.S. attitude vis-a-vis the Third
World." <p>

"Terrorism Should Not Dominate The Agenda In Lyon"<p>

Lise Patelli wrote in regional L'Est Eclair (6/27), "Bill Clinton said
yesterday that he intended to focus on the fight  against terrorism in
Lyon....  However, one hopes that this issue, though  important, will not
(dominate the agenda) of the talks on jobs, currency  and financial issues
and international trade." <p>

"G-7 Works"<p>

Regional Le Republicain Lorrain said (6/27), "Having implemented the 
recommendations of previous G-7 summits, the United States is healthy
again, with  a stable growth rate, low inflation, reduced deficits, a
reasonable  unemployment rate and 10 million jobs created in three
years."<p>

"European Should Present A Truly Collective Front"<p>

In his editorial on Europe One radio, political analyst  Alain Duhamel
said (6/27),: "To make the G-7 summits really balanced, therefore
fruitful, it would be necessary for the Europeans to be better organized
vis-a-vis the United States, i.e., to present a truly collective front. 
Then the G-7 would really be useful."<p>

GERMANY:  "Time To Reform G-7 Meetings?"<p>

Carl Graf Hohenthal judged in right-of-center Frankfurter Allgemeine
(6/27), "The state leaders should try to find out whether the time is not
ripe for a comprehensive reform of  the agenda and the form of the
meeting....  In addition, the economic summit is ailing because too many 
problems are being put on the agenda....  And the subjects are being 
discussed in such a manner that it is being too much for the state 
leaders to comprehend everything.  What have questions to do on the 
agenda such as a discussion about credit financing mechanisms of the IMF 
or the development of an early warning system against debt crises?  These 
questions are important but they must be discussed in the corresponding 
bodies.... <p>

"The state leaders do not really want to address these issues.  They  are
much more interested in presenting themselves.  The U.S. president  wants
to demonstrate new strength and wants to cut a good picture for his 
reelection, the Russian president wants the same and is sending his 
premier, the Japanese premier will refer to the growing significance of 
Asia, and the French president, as the host of the meeting, wants to try  
to present his country from its best side.... It is favorable that
Chancellor Kohl, as the most experienced  leader, wants to remind his
colleagues of the fact that, among the G-7,  there is no leader but only
partners.  The chancellor knows much better than all the other leaders
that an informal get-togethers of equal  partners are much better than
communiques that address all kinds of  subjects....  It would be much
better if the summiteers talked about the  following subjects at the
coming G-7 summits: (to establish) an informal  round of talks without any
communique and the state leaders of important  Asian and Latin American
states would also attend these meetings.  If the  G-7 found an
understanding on this approach, a lot would have been gained  in Lyon."
<p>


BRITAIN:  "Clinton Determined To Put Terrorism At Top Of G-7 Agenda"<p>

On BBC TV's Breakfast News, reporter Brian Hanrahan said from Lyon (6/27),
"President Clinton arrived determined to put action against terrorism at
the top of the G-7 agenda.  He argues that the Dhahran bombing showed
there can be no economic security unless they can stand together against
the forces of terrorism....  The security which surrounds the summit will
reinforce the report of experts who are to submit practical
recommendations to the leaders to deal with terrorism, international crime
and drug smuggling.  It is part of a trend which has turned the summits
away from grandiose plans on foreign affairs and economics.  The leaders
have accepted that they either cannot agree on common policies or they
cannot implement them.  Instead, they agree on common approaches to common
problems."<p>

ITALY:  "Disputes Among Members" <p>

Ennio Caretto wrote in centrist, top-circulation Corriere della Sera
(6/27), "Occurring between the crucial elections in Israel and  Russia,
and on the eve of those in Bosnia in September and the United States in
November, the G-7 summit is likely to have as its watchword  `don't rock
the boat.'  But the G-7 horizon presents more clouds than  clear skies,
and if the summit concludes with a series of postponements  there could be
serious repercussions.... The risk of an impasse at the summit stems from
the unexpected disputes among its members .  Over the  last few months,
America has adopted an exaggerated unilateralism.  It  has placed itself
on a collision course with Europe, in addition to  Japan, regarding trade,
even accusing the latter of stealing contracts  with China.  With its `no'
to Boutros Ghali's re-election, it has  provoked a crisis which could have
been avoided.  It is a strategy which  smells of blackmail, justified by
an America with a superior record of  performance and morality.  U.S.
Treasury Minister Rubin noted, `over the  last three years, we have
created seven times as many jobs as all G-7  nations together, and have
fought G-7 enemies alone.'" <p>

RUSSIA:  "G-7 Will Take Advantage of Yeltsin's Absence" <p>

Dmitry Gornostayev opined on page one of centrist Nezavisimaya Gazeta
(6/27), "The G-7 is likely to take advantage of Boris Yeltsin's absence in
Lyon....  As a participant in so important a forum, Chernomyrdin, being no
big, world-class politician, is quite predictable and is no match for
Yeltsin who can be stunning, at times appearing rather self-confident and
shocking to Western leaders." <p>

"G-7 Members Disappointed Over Yeltsin's  Absence" <p>

Oleg Bergazov reported from Lyon in reformist Segodnya (6/27), "G-7
members were somewhat disappointed on learning that Russian Premier
Chernomyrdin will stand in for President Yeltsin in Lyon, but the leaders
of European countries and the United States said they appreciated the
reasons why Boris Yeltsin could not come." <p>

JAPAN:  "Clinton, Hashimoto Should Discuss Trade Issues Candidly" <p>

Liberal Tokyo Shimbun remarked (6/27), "In his personal letter to Prime
Minister Hashimoto, President Clinton said a successful settlement of
semiconductor, insurance and civil aviation issues is just as important as
the settlement of bilateral security issues.  The president and the prime
minister are to meet prior to the start of the G-7 summit.  Cabinet-level
talks on trade issues are also planned during the Lyon meeting.  We hope
Clinton and Hashimoto will discuss the trade issues in a candid manner. 
As long as the U.S. position is politically-motivated because of the
presidential election, the Clinton-Hashimoto meeting will be futile.  The
U.S. should study--in a serious manner--Japanese proposals for switching
from the governmental semiconductor accord to the establishment of a
private-sector 'cooperation framework' and for holding a multilateral
conference on microchips."<p>

<p>

CHINA:  "Trade Frictions With U.S. Trouble G-7 Summit"<p>

The official Communist Party People's Daily Overseas Edition maintained
(6/27), "The (Helms-Burton) Act, in which the United States unilaterally
imposes sanctions against Cuba and punishes foreign companies having
business with Cuba, has angered allied nations.  A few days ago, the EU
leaders issued a strong warning against this new U.S. trade policy.  EU
leaders denounced the extraterritorial law, saying that it infringes upon
the interests and unity of the allied nations and undermines free trade
principles....  The trade frictions between the United States and the EU
and Canada will trouble the G-7 summit...  Although the summit is not a
forum for resolving international trade disputes, U.S. legislation that
infringes upon the trade interests of the allied nations will inevitably
cast a shadow over the summit.  This situation will further reveal the
awkward and isolated position of the U.S."<p>

EGYPT:  "What Is The U.S. Position"<p>

Salama Ahmed Salama, columnist, pro-government daily Al  Ahram (6/27),
wrote,: "There was no choice before the Arab  summit....  Arab countries
could either accept Netanyahu's  program...and decide to stop
normalization...or to waste  the chance of the Israeli right-wing and
confirm their  insistence on a comprehensive and just peace....  They 
have given Netanyahu's government a chance to reconsider  until...after
the American elections. It was clear that  this chance was meant to be
given to the United States itself....   It is not enough that Washington
demands Arab countries to  be patient and not to stop normalization. 
Christopher has  to tell us what the U.S. position is after Arab countries 
have fulfilled U.S. demands." <p>

"Astonishing"<p>

Pro-government Al Ahram (6/27) opined:  "Strangely, while the new Israeli
government claims that  it supports peace in the region, all its
statements have  nothing to do with the peaceful settlement.  More 
strangely, it has declared this position in Secretary  Christopher's
presence and with his consent....  It is  very astonishing that the
Israeli and American parties  raise the issue of Egypt's obtaining land
missiles...while  Israel is not ashamed to obtain nuclear weapons and to 
refuse to join the NPT.  Then what kind of peace about  which Israel is
talking and what is the meaning of the  American support for its
positions?"<p>

ISRAEL:  "Tough Posture" <p>

Liberal, independent Haaretz (6/27) held, "Prime Minister Netanyahu
displayed in his talks with Secretary of State Christopher a tough posture
which, it must be admitted, was consistent with his election campaign
slogans.... The Prime Minister appears not to have demonstrated even the
tiniest amount of flexibility .... The American reaction can be measured
by the polite reprimand Netanyahu received from the U.S. Secretary who
told him that there can be no security without peace.  Christopher's
comments reflect his disappointment with what he had heard from the Prime
Minister .... That said, it is too early to give Netanyahu up as a lost
case.  He may yet soften his attitude and he may wait for his meeting with
President Clinton to display that change.  It is also true that Netanyahu
owes it to many of his voters to go about the diplomatic process in a
different and slower fashion  than his predecessor."

<p>TRUCK BOMB IN SAUDI ARABIA</H3></center>
<p>
<p>
The detonation yesterday evening of a truck bomb outside a Saudi
Arabian
compound housing U.S. and other foreign military personnel came
too late
for commentary in most foreign media, but straightforward reports
of the
explosion and statements by U.S. officials were broadcast by
radio
stations in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and the West Bank.  In London, a
BBC
correspondent speculated that, although the scene in Saudi Arabia
is "very
reminiscent" of the 1983 Beirut bombing that "forced" the
withdrawal of
the Americans from Beirut, "they cannot withdraw from Saudi
Arabia.  Their
commitment to Saudi security is absolute."  Private RTL radio in
Paris,
and Rome's influential <b><i>La  Repubblica</b></i>  both
speculated that
as a result of the bombing, "terrorism may impose itself at the
G-7 summit
in Lyon."<p>
        CHRISTOPHER IN MIDDLE EAST:  'FRUSTRATION OF HOPES' FOR
PEACE?<p>
                                       
Foreign observers' pessimism regarding peaceful progress in the
Middle
East grew stronger following yesterday's talks in Jerusalem
between
Secretary Christopher and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  The
bluntest
assessment came from Moscow's reformist, business-oriented
<b><i>Kommersant Daily</b></i>: "Clinton," it said, "will have to
abandon
his hopes for laurels as a Middle East peacemaker, after all." 
Journalists focused on Mr. Netanyahu's "firmness" in refusing to
commit
himself to a Hebron withdrawal or a meeting with Palestinian
leader Arafat
and on Mr. Christopher's "unhappy and concerned" appearance
during their
press conference.  Israeli Channel 2-TV observed that the
"Americans were
irritated" and top-circulation <b><i>Yediot</b></i> described
them as
"stunned by...Netanyahu's radical positions regarding the
negotiations
with Syria and the Palestinians."  The common perception, shared
by
Israeli and Arab observers, was that Mr. Netanyahu "wants to go
back to
square one" or "wipe the slate clean" and start all over again.

In Cairo, where the secretary holds talks today with the Egyptian
leadership, the press voiced its resentment with developments and
its
disappointment with Mr. Christopher's stance.  Pro-government
<b><i>Al
Akhbar</b></i> stated, "Christopher found nothing to say...but to 
agree
with Netanyahu....  All this indicates that the secretary has
gone  to
Israel not to push the peace process but to ask for Netanyahu's
blessing
of U.S. policies."  The German media were the only ones still
holding out
hope that the "peace process will go on."  Centrist
<b><i>Sueddeutsche
Zeitung</b></i> of Munich insisted that the U.S. secretary of
state
remains, for the peace process, "the right man for the right
time."


BRIEF<p>

 --  G-7 Summit: Clinton 'Strong,' Yeltsin Absent, Europe
'Gloomy'
<p><p>

EDITORS:  Mildred Sola Neely and Pat McArdle<p>


                <center>TRUCK BOMB IN SAUDI ARABIA</center><p>
                                       
IRAQ:  "A Very Powerful Explosive Charge"<p>

Baghdad's <b>INA</b> radio (6/26) noted, "Washington said the
blast, which was
caused by a very powerful explosive charge, destroyed an
eight-story
building which belongs to the Saudi Defense Ministry in which
foreigners
live.....  A senior Pentagon official, who requested
anonymity....spoke
about the way security agencies noticed the truck when it was
approaching
a residential area inside the base, which is surrounded by a
fence.... 
Residents of Al-Khubar, near Dhahran, said the explosion rocked
the
city."<p>

JORDAN:  "All The Hallmarks Of A Deliberate Bombing"<p>

Amman's <b>Radio Jordan</b> in English (6/26) said, "By this
morning, no group
had claimed responsibility for the explosion, but U.S. officials
said the
blast had all the hallmarks of a deliberate bombing....   King
Fahd of
Saudi Arabia has telephoned President Bill Clinton to express his
deep
concern and to offer condolences after the explosion." <p>

SYRIA:  "Intensive Security Efforts Under Way To Arrest
Perpetrators"<p>

Damascus <b>Syrian Arab Republic Radio</b> (6/26) carried this
report:  "The
Saudi Interior Ministry confirmed that 16 Americans were killed
when a
booby-trapped car exploded in front of a building belonging to
the
Ministry of Defense and Aviation in Khubar City in the Eastern
Province.   
The Saudi Press Agency cited a responsible source at the Interior
Ministry
as saying hat it has been confirmed that 16 people were killed,
all
American, and that 252 people of different nationalities were
injured,
some seriously."<p>

WEST BANK:  "Nobody Has Claimed Responsibility"<p>

Jericho's <b>Voice of Palestine</b> (6/26) said, " U.S. President
Bill Clinton
said that the explosion is evidently the result of a terrorist
action.  So
far, nobody has claimed responsibility."<p>

BRITAIN:  "Revenge"<p>

The <b>BBC</b>'s Middle East correspondent Jim Muir said (6/26)
from Nicosia:  "I
think (the bombers) have already achieved what they wanted, which
is
revenge for the execution of the four Saudi nations last
month....  The
Americans have been fearing exactly such an attack, and I think
obviously
it will be deeply alarming both to the Saudis and to the
Americans that
despite the very heightened security precautions that have been
taken,
these people, these Islamic militants, were able to carry out
such a
massive attack under the noses of the authorities."  Asked if the
Americans would now consider leaving Saudi Arabia, Muir said:  "I
think it
will certainly force them to rationalize their presence there,
and the
softer targets, I am sure, will be withdrawn into closely-guarded
compounds--it will be a bit like Beirut.   The scenes we are
seeing now
are very reminiscent of the American Embassy in Beirut, which was
bombed
back in 1983....  That forced the withdrawal of the Americans
from Beirut. 
 They cannot withdraw from Saudi Arabia.   Their commitment to
Saudi
security is absolute.   They will stay there, but they will have
to take
much tighter security precautions."<p>

FRANCE:  "Terrorism In Lyon?"<p>

Private <b>RTL</b> radio in Paris speculated that, "Terrorism may
impose itself
at the G-7 in Lyon."<p>

ITALY:  "Bombing Will Become An Issue At G-7 Summit"<p>

Arturo Zampaglione from New York wrote in left-leaning,
influential
<b><i>La Repubblica</b></i> (6/26): "It is very likely that the
Dhahran
terrorist attack  will end up as an issue on the agenda of the
G-7 summit,
the more so as  Washington, even before the attack, intended to
raise the
issue of  international cooperation in order to isolate countries
such as
Libya,  Iran and Cuba that, according to the United States,
encourage
terrorism.   Last night's explosion...brings American soldiers
back as
targets of   Middle East terrorism, just as in Lebanon in the
'80s."<p>

      CHRISTOPHER IN MIDDLE EAST:  'FRUSTRATION OF HOPES' FOR
PEACE?<p>
                                       
ISRAEL:   "Americans Irritated"<p>

<b>Channel 2-TV</b> observed (6/26), "Should Netanyahu fail to
deliver, his warm
relations with the Americans won't last much beyond November." 
Diplomatic
correspondent Immanuel Rosen added, "The Americans were irritated
by the
rather undiplomatic announcement of the Prime Minister's Office
that
Netanyahu was not going to go into specifics in his talks with
the
secretary."   Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer also said
in top-
circulation, pluralist <b><i>Yediot</b></i> (6/26), "Secretary
Christopher's entourage has been stunned by Prime Minister
Netanyahu's
radical positions regarding the negotiations with Syria and the
Palestinians....   It is obvious that a special effort will be
required to
create an atmosphere of trust between Netanyahu's close
associates and the
American peace team." <p>

"Netanyahu Wants To Go Back To Square One"<p>

Diplomatic writer Aluf Ben observed in liberal, independent
<b><i>Haaretz</b></i> (6/26),  "Netanyahu yesterday spelled out
Israel's
new foreign policy, stressing that he is not going to follow in
the path
of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres....  He wants to go back to
square one
and make a fresh start.  He has revived the slogans and
terminology of the
last Likud government....  When (Christopher) meets with Arafat,
he will
have to use all his diplomatic skills to turn Netanyahu's
ambiguous
comments into a reassuring message." <p>

"A Poor Start" <p>

Under the headline above, veteran pundit Yosef Harif wrote in
pluralist
<b><i>Maariv</b></i> (6/26) regarding Christopher's
'instructions' to
Netanyahu on Hebron, "Simple good manners and fairness should
have told
the secretary to let the prime minister handle with great caution
the very
complex issue of Hebron and not to try to push him into a corner. 
Didn't
the secretary realize that his remarks would only make Arafat
toughen his
stand?"<p>

EGYPT:  "What Made Christopher Change U.S. Policies Overnight?"
<p>

A commentary on the front page of pro-government <b><i>Al
Ahram</b></i>
(6/26) noted, "In the strange press  conference which he held
with...Christopher, Netanyahu blew up all the international 
resolutions
with a simple wave of his hand. He disregarded all Security
Council
resolutions and the agreements reached according to the Madrid
formula and 
Oslo which define the rights of all the Arab states as  well as
the rights
of Israel.  His statements came as a  challenge to peace and
peace-loving
nations all over  the world.... The strangest thing is
that...Christopher...announced in the  press conference that the
United
States supports such  irresponsible statements.  The question is
what made 
Christopher change U.S. policies overnight, when it  approved
Security
Council resolutions and the Madrid  and Oslo agreements, and has
a stable
position on  Jerusalem?  We hope that Mr. Christopher would
answer all our
questions when he comes to Cairo today." <p>

"Why Egyptian Attitudes Toward U.S. Have Changed"<p>

Gamal Badawi, editor-in-chief of opposition <b><i>Al Wafd</b></i>
(6/26),
concluded,: "I wish that his  excellency would spend an hour of
his short
visit and  walk in the Egyptian streets to listen to the
Egyptians
protesting U.S. policy which sided publicly and secretly with
injustice. 
It deviated from the  principles of fairness and freedom on which
the
United States  was founded....  The United States continues to
pamper  the
criminal and refuses to publish the report that  indicts <p>


Israel.  When...Boutros  Ghali publishes the report, he is
punished by
being  deposed from his position.... Your injustice and illogical
acts,
Mr. Christopher, made the people turn their backs  to you and
discredit
your claims that you support  peace,  justice, equality and human
rights."
<p>

"Pitiful"<p>

In the view  of editor-in-chief Galal Dweidar in pro-government
<b><i>Al
Akhbar</b></i> (6/26): "What the  secretary of the world's sole
superpower
said in  Jerusalem was pitiful....  Christopher found nothing to 
say in
the joint press conference with Netanyahu but to  agree with
Netanyahu.... 
All this indicates that the secretary has gone  to Israel not to
push the
peace process but to ask for Netanyahu's blessing of U.S.
policies....
What  Netanyahu and Christopher said shows no respect for the UN
and for
all international agreements." <p>

JORDAN:  "We Hope Christopher Can Put Israel Back On Peace
Track"<p>

Center-left, influential, Arabic-language
<b><i>Al-Dustur</b></i>'s
editorial (6/26) said, "Information and news reports that came
out
following Christopher's talks with the Israeli prime minister
confirm the
fears  that arose as a result of the Israeli right-wing party
coming to 
power....  We hope that Christopher will be able to determine 
the Israeli
policy vis-a-vis the peace process and will succeed in  putting
Israel
back on track again with the requirements of the peace  process."
<p>

"Wiping The Slate Clean, Starting All Over Again"<p>

Columnist Ahmad Muslin judged in pro-government, influential,
Arabic-
language <b><i>Al-Ray</b></i> (6/26): "As for the Israeli stand
on peace,
it is a  different.  It is like an attempt to wipe the slate
clean and
start all  over again." <p>

GERMANY:  "Peace Process Will Go On"<p>

National radio <b>Deutschlandfunk</b> of Cologne (6/25)
commented, "Of course,
the peace process will go on....  Netanyahu has no interest in
reducing
the chances  of Israel-friendly President Clinton at the U.S.
presidential
elections.   For this reason, we can assume that Netanyahu will
avoid
everything that  could seriously threaten the peace process.... 
It is
very unlikely that  far-reaching decision will be made before the
U.S.
elections.   Only then  will it become clear which direction the
Netanyahu
government is heading  for.  A premier who repeats again and
again that
security is for him the  most important subject cannot avoid
cooperating
closely with the United  States.  This offers the United States
influence
and peace a real  chance." <p><p>

"The Right Man For The Right Time"<p>

Josef Joffe had this to say in an editorial in centrist
<b><i>Sueddeutsche
Zeitung</b></i> of Munich (6/26) under the headline above, "This
new
Israeli government has not yet fallen into step.  It would  be
too early
to insinuate that it pursues a tough right-wing policy, and  it
would also
be wrong to say that it would follow the footsteps of the Peres
team. 
This is why an end to any statements would be very helpful.   The
same
would also be helpful for the Arabs, since provocations only
result in a
more rigid attitude.  For Christopher, a Nobel Peace Prize is 
still not
in sight in the region, but an open field for discreet 
diplomacy.  His
equanimity and his poker face are now the right  thing for the
Middle
East." <p>

"What To Tell Cairo"<p>

Left-of-center <b><i>Frankfurter Rundschau</b></i> (6/26) ran
this
editorial, "Christopher will hardly  be able to tell his partners
in Cairo
something new."<p>

<p>

<p>

BRITAIN:  "Netanyahu Firm In Face Of U.S. Peace Pressure" <p>

According to the conservative <b><i>Times</b></i> (6/26):
"Unequivocal
backing from Netanyahu...for increased Jewish settlement in the
occupied
West Bank yesterday cast a shadow over attempts by Warren
Christopher...to
revive the flagging Middle East peace process....  He failed to
satisfy
American hopes that he would provide a firm commitment to pull
Israeli
troops out of the West Bank city of Hebron as agreed in the 1993
peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians." <p>

"Frustration Of Hopes For Middle East" <p>

The centrist <b><i>Independent</b></i> stressed from Jerusalem
(6/26):
"Mr. Christopher gave no hint of distress during a joint press
conference,
but the election of Mr. Netanyahu...has meant that his almost
ceaseless
shuttle diplomacy between Damascus and Jerusalem has counted for
nothing....  The frustration of his hopes for Middle East peace
may also
ensure that Mr. Christopher will not be tempted to prolong his
stay at the
State Department."<p>

FRANCE:  "Empty-Handed Christopher"<p>

Under the above headline, conservative <b><i>Le Figaro</b></i>'s
Jerusalem 
correspondent Philippe Gelie filed (6/26) : "After the warmth in
the past,
the time is now that of  somewhat distant, composing
diplomacy.... 
Christopher is leaving  for Cairo empty-handed.  This is almost a
setback. 
In a communique which  was not very diplomatic, the Israeli prime
minister
had indicated that he  would not unveil his positions until he
meets with
President Clinton in  July in Washington.  (The communique) said
that the 
solid'  Israeli-American friendship is  intact.'  This needs to
be
confirmed." <p>

"Netanyahu Snubs Christopher"<p>

Under the above headline, Christophe Boltanski wrote from
Jerusalem in
influential <b><i>Liberation</b></i> (6/26): "Did he travel for
nothing?...  The Americans get no  encouraging sign about Syria
either."
<p>

"U.S. Campaign"<p>

Influential <b><i>Le Monde</b></i>'s correspondent for the Middle
East
Mouna  Naim wondered (6/26): "It remains to be seen whether
Washington,
for domestic political  purposes, will not increasingly come
closer to the
positions of the new  Israeli government." <p>

RUSSIA:   "Abandon Hopes For M-E Peace Laurels"<p>

According to Valeria Sycheva in reformist, business-oriented
<b><i>Kommersant Daily</b></i> (6/26): "Basically, the situation
in the
'Palestinian sphere' is not hopeless, and Christopher is sure to
try to
present the case as if the peace process in that region
continues, for all
the changes in the Israeli leadership.  It seems that Clinton
will have to
abandon his hopes for laurels as a Middle East peacemaker, after
all, as
his only concern now is to try to avoid being accused of a
Mideast policy
disaster." <p>

ITALY:   "Unhappy, Concerned Christopher"<p>

A dispatch from Jerusalem in left-leaning, influential <b><i>La
Repubblica</b></i> (6/26) read:  "During the press conference at
the  end
of his meeting with the new Israeli prime minister, the secretary
of state
looked unhappy and concerned.  Three hours of talks were not
enough  to
obtain from Netanyahu even the slightest promise to withdraw
Israeli 
troops from Hebron, or a clear commitment to meet Arafat.  It
seems that 
Netanyahu intends to discuss more thoroughly this and other
issues linked 
to the implementation of the peace process when he meets
President 
Clinton...on July 9. <p>


"But what he told Christopher yesterday did  not help to dispel
the
shadows hanging over the negotiations." <p>

"Back"<p>

Lorenzo Cremonesi remarked from Jerusalem in centrist,
top-circulation
<b><i>Corriere della Sera</b></i> (6/26): " With  yesterday's
meeting
between Christopher and Netanyahu, Middle East  negotiations seem
to
returned to the delaying strategies of past  conservative
government
coalitions in Israel." <p>

SWITZERLAND:  "Most Troubling Issues Sidestepped"<p>

Ouri Daniel observed for centrist <b><i>Tribune de Genve</b></i>
(6/26),
"The most troubling issues were carefully sidestepped--including
Jewish
colonization of the West Bank and potential sanctions against
Syria for
its support of extremist groups.  Israelis and Americans--as
allied as
ever--took each others' pulses in response to the changing
electoral
climate. Netanyahu and Clinton have no choice but to work
together, even
if the vibes between them are not ideal."<p>

BRIEF<p>

G-7 SUMMIT:  YELTSIN ABSENT, CLINTON 'STRONG,' EUROPE 'GLOOMY'<p>

FRANCE:  "U.S. Self-Satisfaction"<p>

Conservative <b><i>Le Figaro</b></i>'s economic
<b><i>Fig-Eco</b></i>
(6/26) observed, "Bill Clinton is coming to Lyon with pride.  He
can claim
having created  9,700,000 jobs over the past three and a half
years.... 
With this  record, a campaigning Bill Clinton expects the Lyon
summit to
be an  opportunity for him to show to his fellow citizens that
America is
again a model for the whole world.  But this may not be the case,
given
the  strong criticism which the United States is receiving from
its
partners, above all  regarding its trade policy (Helms-Burton,
D'Amato)....  Another point of  friction is development aid for
LDCs.... 
The lack of interest in the  U.S. public for these development
issues has
saved Bill Clinton from any  criticism at home on these
questions." <p>

"No Russian President: Fragility of Russian Reform"<p>

Rightist <b><i>Le Quotidien</b></i> (6/26) said: "The absence of
the
Russian president...will remind the West of the  fragility of
economic and
political reforms in Russia--reforms which the  G-7 traditionally
supports."<p>

RUSSIA:  "Russia As Market-Economy Country" <p>

Tatyana Yudina asserted in centrist <b><i>Nezavisimaya
Gazeta</b></i>
(6/26): "The symbolic aspect of Russian participation, based on
the
recognition of Russia's role in world affairs, increasingly
recedes into
the background.  Its foreign policy is getting more pragmatic. 
Now it is
no longer 'participation for participation's sake,' as we need to
work
more to establish equal, mutually advantageous cooperation in
specific
areas.  In that regard, acknowledging Russia as a market-economy
nation is
vital....  The development of partnership with the leading powers
and
continued integration with the world's economy remain a priority
in
Russian foreign policy."<p>

CHINA:  "Take Precautions Before G-7 Summit"<p>

Moscow Correspondents Gao Faming and Jia Yanjing wrote in the
official
Communist Youth League <b><i>China Youth Daily</b></i> (6/26): 
"The G-7
meeting in Lyon meeting will face two tough problems.  First, the
Russian
president will not be able to attend, and this will cause the
momentum of
the 'seven plus one' political consultations to slow....  Second,
development assistance will be a hot topic at the Lyon summit. 
France...
particularly wants to make the <p>


United States bear more responsibility in this area.  If... there
is a
breakthrough on the issue of development assistance, that would
be a major
success for France." <p>

JAPAN:  "G-7 Summit Should Show Way To Peace And Development"<p>

Top-circulation, moderate <b><i>Yomiuri</b></i> (6/26) held, "The
Lyon G-7
summit, opening on Thursday, is called an economic summit meeting
to pave
the way into the 21st century.  As host of the summit, France has
proposed
that economic globalization be a focus of the talks.... The G-7
leaders
should engage in meaningful and straightforward dialogue aimed at
realizing peace and balancing economic development throughout the
world.... <p>

"One of the central themes during political discussions will be
to further
efforts to cooperate on matters related to the 'safety and
stability of
the international community' as the 21st century approaches. 
Taking into
account the interests of the United States and the European
countries,
discussions will almost certainly center on supporting Russia's
reform
efforts, rehabilitation of war-torn Bosnia and encouraging the
Middle East
peace process.  Patience on the part of the G-7 leaders will be
crucial in
solving these weighty problems if a better world order is to be
established in this post-Cold War era.  The leaders also have a
responsibility to demonstrate direction and must pledge to
cooperate
closely in tackling these various problems."<p>

INDONESIA:  "Gloomy G-7 Summit"<p>

The pro-government, English-language <b><i>Indonesia
Times</b></i> (6/26)
held, "The coming G-7 summit may be gloomy because there is still
anger in
Europe over the U.S. trade policy, particularly over the prospect
of
sanctions for foreign firms doing business with Cuba....  The
problem is
that unilateral action by the United States is increasingly seen
as a
challenge to the multi-lateral trade policies which the WTO was
set up to
encourage.... The threat is no empty one.  The Clinton
administration has
already warned three companies...to get out of Cuba or face
sanctions
under which their senior executives could be denied entry into
the United
States."<p>

<h3>G-7 IN LYON:<br>
SUMMIT OF 'APPARENT AGREEMENTS?</center></H3>
<p>
<p>

There were mixed reviews from observers abroad for the Group of
Seven leading industrialized nations' "fireworks of
recommendations, resolutions and decisions"--as described by
Paris's influential, private <b>TF-1</b> TV--at the end of their
weekend gathering in Lyon.  While Paris's <b>TF-1</b> TV judged
that these summits are "effective," German regional radio
Hessischer Rundfunk held that this one offered no "tangible
results."  Even the declarations championed by President Clinton
regarding strengthening the international fight against
terrorism--in the wake of the bomb attack in Saudi Arabia--
received contradictory assessments.  Edinburgh's centrist
<b><i>Scotsman</b></i> asserted that Lyon would be a "success" if
it produces the practical measures Mr. Clinton introduced.  Many
other analysts, however, instead emphasized the differences
remaining among the participants concerning the root causes of
terrorism and how best to stamp it out.  They highlighted the
Europeans' "rejection" of Washington trade sanctions legislation
aimed at Cuba, Iran and Libya as perceived supporters of
terrorism.<p>

The summit's pronouncements on the Middle East peace process were
hailed by Arab media--from Syria to Egypt, as support for their
stance against the newly installed Netanyahu government in
Israel.  Cairo's pro-government <b><i>Al  Akhbar</b></i> said,
"The  G-7 adoption of the principle of 'land for peace' proves 
the soundness of the Cairo Arab summit resolutions."  This
conclusion was shared in Israel by mass-appeal, pluralist
<b><i>Maariv</b></i>, which commented, "The leaders of the seven
rich nations plus Russia sent from Lyon a crystal clear message
to Benjamin Netanyahu:  Don't lose any time."  Other significant
issues raised by commentators included the absence of Russian
President Yeltsin at a time when Russia is being considered for
admission to the exclusive club of seven, China's desire to be
admitted and the need to solve U.S.-Japan trade disputes by the
end of July.  <p>

FRANCE:  "Fireworks Of Recommendations" <p>

Commenting on the variety of issues examined, influential,
private TV <b>TFf-l</b>'s Regis Faucon spoke (6/28) of "'the
fireworks' of recommendations, resolutions and decisions" and
concluded: "In general, G-7 summits are effective." <p>

"A Rather Disunited Front Against Terrorism"<p>

Under the headline above, special correspondent to Lyon Pierre
Haski filed for influential <b><i>Liberation</b></i> (6/29): "It
has been difficult to translate the U.S. dramatization of the
terrorism issue, in the wake of the Saudi Arabia attack, into
concrete action in Lyon....  The U.S.  focus on terrorism is due
to presidential candidate Clinton's political motivations.  But
it is also linked to a political vision which he tried to convey,
vainly, at the Sharm El-Sheikh summit in March: the United States
condemns the European policy of 'critical dialogue' with Iran."
<p>

"Expand G-7"<p>

Influential <b><i>Le Monde</b></i> (6/29) reported on the
"confrontation" between the United States on one side and Europe,
Japan and Canada on the other concerning how to deal with
countries suspected of supporting terrorism, saying that "the
anti-Washington front held firm."  In its unattributed lead
editorial, the paper argued that it is necessary to "expand the
G-7": "How can one discuss the rules of the game needed to
control economic globalization without (some) major players in
this globalization, whose explosive growth disturbs the old
economic order?...  The current composition of the G-7 lacks
coherence....  The G-7 must open itself to new powers, or it will
not meet its ambition of becoming a regulator of globalization of
the economy." <p>

GERMANY:   "No Tangible Results"<p>

Regional radio <b>Hessischer Rundfunk</b> of Frankfurt (6/28)
aired the following editorial:     "After each summit meeting
there is a growing impression that  the many difficult problems
which the summiteers have to deal with could  be better resolved
on a bilateral basis....  Ill feelings are developing  because
there are no tangible results, no quick solutions because, when 
they talk about globalization, a great part of this world is not 
represented on this type of club membership meetings." <p>

"Economic Issues On Backburner"<p>

A commentary on national radio <b>Deutschlandfunk</b> of Cologne
(6/28) maintained: "What the seven most important industrialized
countries had to say  regarding the solution of the unemployment
problem was meager....  Obviously, the unemployment problem is
not considered  a dangerous fire that could easily spread.  All
in all, compared to  political subjects, economic topics were put
in the background at this  summit." <p>

"Superficial Declaration On Terrorism"<p>

Centrist <b><i>Stuttgarter Zeitung</b></i> (6/29) said in an
editorial, "The United States is a big and sometimes difficult
partner, and  this at times when the president is also an
election campaigner, since  the United States then claims to play
the leadership role among the G-7,  too.  Bill Clinton referred
to the bloody bomb attack in Dhahran to  redefine the agenda of
the summit in Lyon...but the declaration on  terrorism remains
superficial....  The controversial subject between  Europe and
the United States as to what extent trade can contribute to 
change did not take place, although it should urgently be
discussed."<p>

<p>


BRITAIN:   "Lyon A Success If It Produces What Clinton Seeks On
Terrorism"<p>

According to the centrist <b><i>Scotsman</b></i> of Edinburgh
(6/28): "The Dhahran outrage will put valuable momentum behind
President Clinton's search for greater concerted efforts against
future crimes of this kind.  If Lyon produces the practical
measures that Mr. Clinton seeks, then it will be considered a
success." <p>

RUSSIA:  "It Takes Yeltsin To Make G-7 Into G-8" <p>

Alexander Golz wrote in centrist, army <b><i>Krasnaya
Zvezda</b></i> (6/29): "Too bad Boris Yeltsin couldn't go to
Lyon, as this is when Russia could really join the club of the
world's principal nations....  For G-7 to become a G-8, it
certainly takes Yeltsin being present in the flesh, with all his
vigor and authority....  Yet, the president's decision not to
come was quite justified and obvious....  The leaders of the
world's major powers are practical people.  They know only too
well that if the elections bring about cardinal changes in
Russia, they, Western leaders, will face totally different
problems....  Far be it from me to blame all our woes on the
West.  But throughout Russian reforms, our partners dawdled
around and bargained instead of acting swiftly and resolutely. 
Had they not done so, there wouldn't have been so much skepticism
in Russia these days regarding cooperation with the West....  And
as a result, the coming elections would have been less of an
epoch-making event." <p>

"Flee Lyon, Russia" <p>

Vladimir Bolshakov mused in neo-Communist <b><i>Pravda</b></i>
(6/29): "If we were to think of what converting G-7 into a G-8
might portend for this country, we would flee Lyon this minute. 
Today's Russia does not qualify as a highly industrialized
nation.  Whatever in its economy is fast rising these days has to
do with foreign debt, prices, taxes and inflation....  Under the
circumstances, admitting Russia to the Big Seven looks like
adopting a poor relative who will have to live by somebody else's
rules.  The Lyon summit may well become a prologue to the future
division of Russia which was planned by the West and partly
implemented by Gorbachev and his successors."<p>

ITALY:  "Europeans Won't Yield To U.S. Congress"<p>

Andrea di Robilant commented from Lyon in centrist <b><i>La
Stampa</b></i> (6/29):  "The  Europeans won't yield to the will
of the U.S. Congress, and unanimously  rejected the sanctions
approved in Washington against whoever invests or  trades with
Cuba, Iran or Libya.  This political-trade dispute  between the
two shores of the Atlantic, made even more sensitive by the
terrorist emergency raised by the Dhahran bombing, created the
only flaw  in an otherwise relaxed discussion of major economic
issues.  At the end,  the Europeans and the Americans remained
committed to their respective  positions."<p>

BELGIUM:  "Unanimity On Terrorism, None On Economic Issues"<p>

Conservative Catholic <b><i>Gazet van Antwerpen</b></i> (7/1)
remarked, "Immediately after the murderous bomb attack in Saudi
Arabia...U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to put the struggle
against terrorism at the top of the G-7 summit in Lyon.  As a
polite host, French President Chirac honored that request
immediately.  In retrospect, this change on the agenda has
yielded one of the few concrete decisions at the G-7
conference.... <p>

"There was much less unanimity--not to say none at all--in the
economic segment of the talks.  President Clinton was rebuffed by
everybody when he defended the so-called Helms-Burton law."<p>


HUNGARY:  "G-6+1"<p>

Highest circulation <b><i>Nepszabadsag</b></i> (6/29) held, "It
has been the impression during the Lyon summit that the
international conference hall was not so much a scene for the G-
7, but rather a  "G-6+1" where President Clinton was playing  the
thankless role of "+1."  President Chirac, hosting the event, has
made the situation more difficult by acting as a spokesman for
the Third World and turning down American demands for
strengthening the embargo against Iran and Libya.  Velvet
statements of support mask clashes of economic interest, since
French, Italian and German companies have fruitful business
relations in Iran and in Libya.  But it would be an exaggeration
to say that Lyon was the scene of permanent disputes, since the
leaders of the G-7 have after all had a good discussion,
indicating that the future of this exclusive club is not as
hopeless as it seemed before the summit."<p>

SPAIN:   "Apparent Agreement, But Differences Remain On
Terrorism" <p>

Madrid's leading liberal <b><i>El Pais</b></i>'s editorial said
(6/29), "The leaders of the G-7 in Lyon have been forced to add
to the concept  of global economy that of global terrorism, owing
to the truck bomb launched against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
Terrorism is another facet of this  complex phenomena of
globalization...and global measures are needed to  fight it. 
However, after the Seven's apparent agreement, several profound 
differences on the origin of some terrorist movements and how to
fight  them remain.  The United States is trying to impose its
own views and take  reprisals against companies in any country
that maintains ties with Iran and  Libya.  This puts the United
States outside the legal framework of the WTO."<p>

BAHRAIN:  "Fighting Terrorism Is Our Issue Today"<p>

Leading, semi-independent <b><i>Al-Ayyam</b></i>'s editorial
(6/28) held, "Despite the great solidarity and Arab and
international support which sister state Saudi Arabia has
received, we, citizens and leaderships in  the region, must not
forget that all plots and terrorist actions against us target our
stability, security and prosperity.  Perhaps this reminds us  of
what Bahrain has called for--enhancing and activating security 
coordination in the Gulf and unifying all the efforts to fight
terrorism.  Fighting terrorism is our issue today and our duty
for the good, security and stability of the whole Gulf."<p>

EGYPT:   "Un Official For Development Proposal:  Positive
Result"<p>

An editorial in pro-government <b><i>Al Ahram</b></i> (7/1) said:
"The  proposal to appoint a UN deputy secretary general for
development [is one of the positive results of the  summit.]  It
confirms that the current economic world  order may have a bad
impact on poor and developing  countries.... Thus, the summit has
benefited the Third  World, especially after the American
proposal to hasten  breaking the barriers of international
trade...was  rejected." <p>

"G-7  Support For Peace Process"<p>

Galal Dweidar, editor-in-chief of pro-government <b><i>Al 
Akhbar</b></i> (7/1), observed, "Undoubtedly, the position of the
six world  powers... in Lyon has eased much of the embarrassment
of  U.S. policy which is unlawfully biased toward Israel.  
Certainly, the criminal act in Saudi Arabia...eased the  pressure
of succumbing to Netanyahu's extremist policy  toward the peace
process.  The G-7 support for the peace  process...in opposition
to the Israeli extremist  government's demands, expresses the
need to regard  international interests including American
interests.  The  G-7 adoption of the principle of 'land for
peace' proves  the soundness of the Cairo Arab summit
resolutions."<p>

ISRAEL:  "Message From Lyon" <p>

Mass-appeal, pluralist <b><i>Maariv</b></i> (7/1) commented, "The
leaders of the seven rich nations plus <p>

Russia sent from Lyon a crystal clear message to Binyamin
Netanyahu:  Don't lose any time.  Get on with the peace process
right away on the basis of the UN resolutions and Oslo
accords....  In other words, as if there were no elections in
Israel.  President Clinton felt uneasy about personally
delivering such a blatant message.  Therefore, he used the Lyon
summit to prod and even lean on Netanyahu....  It should be said
to President Clinton's credit that he also used the Lyon
conference to put the war on terror on top of the international
agenda.  Unfortunately, his colleagues did not go along." <p>

SYRIA:  "The G-7  Countries' Message To Israel"  <p>

Government-owned <b><i>Tishreen</b></i> (6/30) commented, "G-7 
countries and Russia called upon the countries  involved in the
peace process to immediately abide  by its commitments within the
framework of the land  for peace principles....  G-7 countries
called for the resumption of the  peace talks between Syria,
Lebanon and Israel  because it is a part of peace dynamics that
must be  preserved.  Clearly the message is directed solely to 
Israel."<p>

JAPAN:  "Strong Leadership Needed From Clinton, Hashimoto"<p>

Top-circulation, moderate <b><i>Yomiuri</b></i>'s editorial
concluded (6/29), "During their talks prior to the opening of the
Lyon G-7 summit, President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto
agreed to settle semiconductor and insurance disputes by the end
of July...  But to do this...both Clinton and Hashimoto should
display strong leadership.  One factor that makes negotiations on
these two trade issues difficult is the U.S. presidential
election....  If President Clinton takes a weak stance toward
Japan, U.S. industries and companies will be furious, and he will
face a barrage of criticism from his Republican opponent in the
presidential race.  We understand the president's dilemma.  But
if he adopts an unbending attitude on the trade disputes, it will
not only increase antagonism in Japan but also damage the
reputation of the United States as the free-trade leader."<p>

"More Substantial Measures Needed Against Terrorism"<p>

In the opinion of business-oriented <b><i>Nihon Keizai</b></i>
(6/29), "The determination of G-7 leaders to fight terrorism is
significant, but more concrete and substantial measures are
needed to contain acts of terrorism....  Substantial measures
should be adopted to ease the 'frictions of society' that give
rise to terrorism.  The special statement against terrorism,
issued at the U.S. initiative at the Lyon G-7 summit, did not
address this aspect of the problem."<p>

CHINA:    "China's Influence Cannot Be Neglected" <p>

Zheng Ruelin wrote for official, Shanghai Municipal <b><i>Wenhui
Daily</b></i> (7/1), "If there is anything that merits attention
by the Chinese concerning the G-7 summit, it is  probably the
fact that China is excluded from the summit.  As far as past
summits were concerned, China did not exist at all.  Today,
China's shadow is pacing up and down in Lyon.  This is a change
worth noting.  Of course, China's shadow is still not big. 
However, it is certain that if China continues with today's speed
of economic development, in the near future it will be China's
turn to consider what advantages and disadvantages there would be
from participating in the G-7 summit."
     
INDONESIA:   "A Legacy Of Western Colonialism"<p>

Pro-government, Islamic-oriented <b><i>Pelita</b></i> (6/29) held
in an editorial, "The Middle East remains a hot spot...a legacy
of Western colonialism.  The hatreds and violence prevailing in
the region are the result of security and socio-political
conditions created by the United States, France and the UK.  The
bombing is also our concern.  The root cause must be determined
in order to prevent such a thing from recurring.  The
perpetrators should be caught.  But the most important thing is
whether the United States--and the West in general--can take a
moderate stance and review the fundamental issue at hand."<p>

Ever since 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev met with the
G-7 leaders after the regular meetings, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has been meeting with the G-7 leaders annually, usually
immediately after the G-7 meetings.  This year, there was a
summit in Moscow of the G-7 leaders on April 19-20.  
<p>

The most important issues between Russia and the Group of Seven
are development aid in the conversion of Russia to a free market

<b>TEXT:  10/3 USTR ANNOUNCEMENT ON WTO JAPAN FILM CASE
<br>(Japan delays establishment of panel in WTO film case)</b>

<p>Washington -- Although Japan blocked the establishment of the dispute settlement panel for the U.S. case against barriers in Japan's market for photographic film and paper at the October 3 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), Japan will have no right to block a panel from being established at the next DSB meeting on October 16, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).

<p>"The case raises fundamental questions about Japanese government actions and policies to restrict its market from foreign competition," Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement issued October 3.

<p>Following is the text of the USTR announcement:

<p>(begin text)

<p>OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE

<p>Executive Office of the President

<p>Washington, D.C.  20508

<p>Thursday, October 3, 1996

<p>Japan Delays Establishment of a Panel in WTO Film Case

<p>At a meeting today of the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO in Geneva, the U.S. requested the formation of a dispute settlement panel to hear its case against barriers in Japan's market for photographic film and paper.

<p>Acting United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky reasserted the importance of the issues raised in this case, "The United States has strong evidence demonstrating that over a period of years, the Government of Japan systematically put in place a series of discriminatory barriers to block access to its photographic film and paper market."  Ambassador Barshefsky emphasized, "the issues raised by this case should be of real concern to WTO members not only because they reveal the barriers faced by foreign firms in the Japanese film and photographic paper market, but also because they are indicative of the exclusionary policies the Japanese Government has implemented in many sectors of the Japanese economy."

<p>Although the Government of Japan blocked the establishment of the panel at today's meeting, Japan will have no right to block a panel from being established at the next DSB meeting on October 16.  "It is unfortunate that Japan blocked the panel request at this meeting.  We would like to see resolution of this matter as quickly as possible," Barshefsky stated.  "This position seems inconsistent with prior statements that they would welcome this case in the WTO."

<p>In today's DSB meeting, the United States noted that many have continued to perceive or portray this case as merely an issue of private practices by a major Japanese film company, and a dispute between two companies.  To the contrary, Barshefsky noted, "The case raises fundamental questions about Japanese government actions and policies to restrict its market from foreign competition."

<BODY>
Summmit of the Americas <a href="plan.htm"> Plan of Action</a>(continued)<P>
<P>
<h4>II. PROMOTING PROSPERITY THROUGH ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND FREE
TRADE</h4><P>
<P>
<B>9. Free Trade in the Americas</B><P>
<P>
1) While pursuing economic integration and free trade in the
Hemisphere, we reinforce our strong commitment to multilateral
rules and disciplines.  We endorse full and rapid implementation
of the Uruguay Round, active multilateral negotiations in the
World Trade Organization, bilateral and subregional trade
agreements, and other trade arrangements that are consistent with
the provisions of the GATT/WTO and that do not raise barriers to
other nations.<P>
<P>
2) Extraordinary achievements have been made by countries of the
Hemisphere in trade liberalization and subregional integration.
Free trade and increased economic integration are key factors for
sustainable development.  This will be furthered as we strive to
make our trade liberalization and environmental policies mutually
supportive, taking into account efforts undertaken by the
GATT/WTO and other international organizations.  As economic
integration in the Hemisphere proceeds, we will further secure
the observance and promotion of worker rights, as defined by
appropriate international conventions.  We will avoid disguised
restrictions on trade, in accordance with the GATT/WTO and other
international obligations.<P>
<P>
3) We will strive to maximize market openness through high levels
of discipline as we build upon existing agreements in the
Hemisphere.  We also will strive for balanced and comprehensive
agreements, including among others: tariffs and non-tariff
barriers affecting trade in goods and services; agriculture;
subsidies; investment; intellectual property rights; government
procurement; technical barriers to trade; safeguards; rules of
origin; antidumping and countervailing duties; sanitary and
phytosanitary standards and procedures; dispute resolution; and
competition policy.<P>
<P>
4) We recognize that decisions on trade agreements remain a
sovereign right of each nation.  In addition, recognizing the
importance of effective enforcement of international commitments,
each nation will take the necessary action, in accordance with
its own legislation and procedures, to implement the agreements
in the areas covered by this Plan of Action.<P>
<P>
5) As we work to achieve the "Free Trade Area of the Americas,"
opportunities such as technical assistance will be provided to
facilitate the integration of the smaller economies and increase
their level of development.<P>
<P>
<em u><b>IMMEDIATE ACTION AGENDA</b></em><P>
<p>
We direct our ministers responsible for trade to take the
following concrete initial steps to achieve the "Free Trade Area
of the Americas."<P>
<P>
6) With the objective of ensuring full and complete discussion
among the parties to the various trade agreements in the
Hemisphere, we direct that meetings be held under existing trade
and investment fora.  Members of these fora will determine areas
of commonality and divergence in the particular agreements under
review and should consider the means of improving disciplines
among them and bringing them together.  We further direct that
members of these fora inform ministers of the status of their
discussions and make recommendations for achieving the "Free
Trade Area of the Americas."<P>
<P>
7) Transparency in, and a clear understanding of, the subregional
and bilateral agreements achieved to date among the nations in
the Hemisphere are critical for advancing trade and investment
integration in the Americas.  We will direct the OAS Special
Committee on Trade, with the support of the IDB, ECLAC, and other
specialized regional and subregional organizations, to assist in
the systematization of data in the region and to continue its
work on studying economic integration arrangements in the
Hemisphere, including brief comparative descriptions of the
obligations in each of the Hemisphere's existing trade
agreements.  We will further direct the Special Committee on
Trade to prepare a report of its work by June 1995 for the
meeting of ministers.<P>
<P>
8) We direct our ministers responsible for trade to: (a) review
the progress of work undertaken in the fora noted in paragraphs 6
and 7; (b) provide guidance with respect to further work; and (c)
consider areas for immediate attention -- such as customs
facilitation and product testing and certification with a view to
mutual recognition agreements -- that could be taken up in the
appropriate fora.<P>
<P>
9)  Therefore, today we launch the "Free Trade Area of the
Americas" by initiating the following process.  We will direct
the OAS to assist the host country in arranging the ministerial
meetings.<P>
<P>
January 1995: Initiation of work programs and establishment of
schedules in the fora in paragraph 6 and in the Special Committee
onTrade.<P>
<P>
June 1995:  Meeting of Ministers responsible for trade.<P>
<P>
-- preliminary report on status of work in the fora described in
paragraph 6.<P>
<P>
-- preliminary Special Committee on Trade report.<P>
<P>
-- areas for immediate consideration.<p>

March 1996:  Meeting of Ministers responsible for trade.<P>
<P>
-- final report to ministers by the Special Committee on          
Trade.<P>
<P>
-- final reports to ministers from the fora described in          
paragraph 6.<P>
<P>
-- timetable for further work.<P>
<P>
<B>10.  Capital Markets Development and Liberalization</B><P>
<P>
The availability of capital at competitive rates is essential to
finance private sector investment -- a vital ingredient in
economic development.  Developing, liberalizing and integrating
financial markets domestically and internationally, increasing
transparency, and establishing sound, comparable supervision and
regulation of banking and securities markets will help to reduce
the cost of capital by enhancing investor and depositor
confidence.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Form a Committee on Hemispheric Financial Issues to examine steps
to promote the liberalization of capital movements and the
progressive integration of capital markets, including, if deemed
appropriate, the negotiation of common guidelines on capital
movements that would provide for their progressive
liberalization.<P>
<P>
Prepare, in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank,
a comprehensive list of national capital regulations in order to
promote transparency and support the discussions in the Committee
on Hemispheric Financial Issues.<P>
<P>
Support the cooperative endeavors of the Association of Latin
American and Caribbean Bank Supervisors and the Council of
Securities Regulators of the Americas to provide sound
supervision and regulation that support the development and
progressive integration of markets.<P>
<P>
The Committee on Hemispheric Financial Issues should also review
problems of debt in the Hemisphere, taking account of ongoing
work and drawing, as appropriate, on a broad range of
expertise.<P>
<P>
<B>11.  Hemispheric Infrastructure</B><P>
<P>
Development in this Hemisphere depends on urgent infrastructure
measures, including the priority allocation of financial
resources, in accordance with national legislation and with the
participation of both the public and private sectors. 
Strengthening the flow of private productive capital to
economically and environmentally sound projects has become
increasingly vital to countries throughout the Hemisphere as the
 growth of official sources of capital has failed to keep pace
with the area's needs.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Charge multilateral development banks to work with governments
and, as appropriate, private concerns, to develop mechanisms to
deal with lending and investment issues.<P>
<P>
Draw on other regional and sub-regional experiences within the
Hemisphere to support infrastructure development.<P>
<P>
Governments that so wish will develop suitable mechanisms,
including multilateral and bilateral commitments on regulatory
and legal rules and practices, to encourage private investment,
both domestic and foreign, in national and transboundary
infrastructure projects.<P>
<P>
<B>12. Energy Cooperation</B><P>
<P>
The nations of the Hemisphere have begun a new era of economic
growth.  This new era is based on greater economic cooperation,
freer trade, and open markets.  Sustainable economic development
requires hemispheric cooperation in the field of energy.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Convene a follow-up hemispheric officials' meeting in the first
semester of 1995 to encourage cooperation to study ways to
develop the energy industry within the Hemisphere, consistent
with the least cost national energy strategies and the activities
described in the "Partnership for Sustainable Energy use" in the
following areas:<P>
<P>
Consideration of ways to use the energy sector to promote
sustainable economic growth.<P>
<P>
Cooperation to study ways to optimize and facilitate the
financing mechanisms of international financial institutions to
support the development of projects in the energy sector,
especially including those pertaining to the enhancement of
efficiency in the use of energy and to non-conventional renewable
energy.<P>
<P>
Cooperation to promote capital investment and to foster the use
of innovative financial mechanisms to increase investment in the
energy sector and the enhancement of efficiency in the use of
energy and non-conventional renewable energy, in accordance with
each country's legislation and developmental needs.<P>
<P>
Promotion of the use of efficient and non-polluting energy
technologies, both conventional and renewable, leading to a
higher degree of knowledge and technical expertise in this
area.<P>
<p>
Consideration of the enhancement of ongoing efforts to establish
electric and other energy facilities in accordance with domestic
regulatory frameworks and, where appropriate, under sub-regional
agreements.<P>
<P>
(This initiative is integrally linked with the Partnership for
Sustainable Energy Use item.)<P>
<P>
<B>13. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure</B><P>
<P>
A country's information infrastructure -- telecommunications,
information technology, and broadcasting -- is an essential
component of political, economic, social and cultural
development.  The information infrastructure development needs in
the Americas are immense.  The governments of the Americas intend
to meet these needs by engaging in multiple actions, where
consistent with the irrespective governing laws, such as:
encouraging private sector investment to increase participation
in the telecommunications and information infrastructure sectors;
promoting competition; implementing flexible regulatory regimes;
stimulating diversity of content, including cultural and
linguistic diversity; providing access to information networks
for service and information providers; and ensuring universal
service, so that the benefits of the information infrastructure
will be available to all members of our societies.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Engage in ongoing discussions at the international level of the
actions referred to above and endeavor to take those actions in
their own countries, taking account of domestic conditions and
circumstances.<P>
<P>
Undertake efforts to make government information more publicly
available via electronic means.<P>
<P>
Review the availability and interoperability of connections to
international networks that facilitate trade, improve education
and improve access to health care.<P>
<P>
Encourage major universities, libraries, hospitals and government
agencies to have access to these networks, building on the work
of the OAS Hemisphere-Wide Inter-University Scientific and
Technological Information Network.<P>
<P>
Via the OAS Inter-American Telecommunications Commission (CITEL),
and in coordination with the sub-regional telecommunications
organizations, develop and carry out a work program to:<P>
<P>
-- Evaluate regulatory, technical and legal means to promote
liberalization, common standards, interoperability of networks
and compatible use of the radio spectrum.<P>
<P>
-- Examine ways to promote greater consistency of the
 certification processes for telecommunications equipment among
member countries.<P>
<P>
-- Develop regional guidelines for the provision of international
value-added network services.<P>
<P>
Support a meeting by 1996, coordinated by CITEL, of senior
telecommunications officials to conduct further discussions of
the above actions.<P>
<P>
<B>14.  Cooperation in Science and Technology</B><P>
<P>
There is a need to re-assess the on-going interaction among the
region's science and technology (S&amp;T) infrastructure and
cooperative mechanisms; to provide impetus for improved
cooperation; to reduce barriers to collaboration; to augment the
demand for technology; and to disseminate information about
technological opportunities using new advances in information
technology; and generally to improve communications among the key
S&amp;T organizations, researchers in the region, and growing
technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises.<P>
<P>
The commitment of the countries of the Americas to non-
proliferation has gained new momentum with the acceptance of the
international safeguard regime by some of our countries.  The
outstanding progress achieved in this field is to be commended
and should contribute to enhanced opportunities for cooperation
in the area of advanced goods and technologies.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Convene a meeting of ministers responsible for science and
technology in the Hemisphere within the next year to assess
progress and to promote the Bolivar Programme and the OAS Common
Market of Scientific and Technological Knowledge (MERCOCYT)
program, to provide the necessary support to improve scientific
partnerships and technological ventures in the region, and to
explore the possibility of establishing a council on science and
technology.<P>
<P>
Use existing multilateral mechanisms in the region to address a
wide number of common S&amp;T interests, including enhanced
professional technical training, development and implementation
of national policies and regional programs, dissemination and
standardization of science and technology (including metrology
and other technical norms), environmental technology development,
and more effective partnerships to promote learning and
competitiveness.<P>
<P>
Stimulate greater S&amp;T interaction in the Hemisphere and
support efforts already undertaken in other fora, including the
Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, and the
International Research Institute for Climate Prediction.
Governments will serve to advance and communicate new initiatives
 such as the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
Environment (GLOBE) program.<P>
<P>
Confirm their interest in participating in new initiatives driven
by a demand from private sector and non-government interests in
technological opportunities.<P>
<P>
Confirm their national commitments to share S&amp;T information
with others in the Hemisphere, in accord with their respective
laws, and to expand cooperation in scientific and environmental
research.<P>
<P>
<B>15.  Tourism</B><P>
<P>
Tourism is important to our economies and valuable in promoting
understanding among the people of the Americas.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Undertake initiatives to stimulate tourism in the Hemisphere.<P>

<BODY>

<h2>Appendix</h2> 
(Summit of the Americas<a href="decofpr.htm">Declaration of Principles</a> and <a href="plan.htm"> Plan of Action</a>)<P>

The primary responsibility for implementing this Plan of Action
falls to governments, individually and collectively, with
participation of all elements of our civil societies.<P>
Existing organizations or institutions are called upon to
implement the package of initiatives that has emerged from this
Summit of the Americas.  In many instances we have proposed that
specific issues be examined by meetings of ministers, senior
officials or experts. We are also proposing that some of these
initiatives be carried out in partnerships between the public and
private sector.  Wanting to benefit from existing hemispheric
mechanisms, and considering the various proposals included in
this Plan of Action, we offer the following recommendations,
which shall not impede any government from approaching other
institutions not cited herein, as appropriate.<P>

<h4>IV.  GUARANTEEING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVING OUR
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS</h4><P>
<P>
<B>21. Partnership for Sustainable Energy Use<P>
</B><P>
Consistent with Agenda 21 and the Framework Convention on Climate
Change, sustainable energy development and use promote economic
development and address environmental concerns.  Governments and
the private sector should promote increased access to reliable,
clean, and least cost energy services through activities and
projects that meet economic, social, and environmental
requirements within the context of national sustainable
development goals and national legal frameworks.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Pursue, in accordance with national legislation, least cost
national energy strategies that consider all options, including
energy efficiency, non-conventional renewable energy (i.e.,
solar, wind, geothermal, small hydro, and biomass), and
conventional energy resources.<P>
<P>
Emphasize market-oriented pricing, which discourages wasteful
energy use.<P>
<P>
Identify for priority financing and development at least one
economically viable project in each of the following areas: non-
conventional renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean
conventional energy.<P>
<P>
Promote, in cooperation with the private sector and rural and
isolated communities, rural electrification programs which take
into account where appropriate the utilization of renewable
energy sources, in accordance with the domestic regulatory
framework.<P>
<P>
Seek to ratify and begin implementation of the provisions of the
Framework Convention on Climate Change which entered into force
on March 21, 1994.<P>
<P>
Encourage the World Bank and IDB to increase promptly and
substantially, as a portion of energy lending, financing of
projects in energy efficiency and renewable energy and financing
to improve the environmental sustainability of conventional
energy sources, in accordance with economic rationality.<P>
<P>
Call on the multilateral financial institutions and other public
and private financial institutions to finance regional and
national programs in support of this action plan, such as
training and exchange programs as well as technology cooperation,
in accordance with the needs and conditions of receiving
countries.<p>

Assist with coordination and technical cooperation between
countries, using existing regional organizations, including
project identification and implementation, training programs, and
personnel and information exchanges to increase capacity.<P>
<P>
Promote the identification and implementation of private sector
projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<P>
<P>
Convene a Sustainable Energy Symposium in the first half of 1995
to discuss follow-up activities relative to this initiative.  In
the spirit of cooperation countries will share their experiences
and discuss progress on implementing this action plan. <P>
<P>
This initiative is integrally linked with the Energy Cooperation
item.<P>
<P>
<B>22. Partnership for Biodiversity</B><P>
<P>
Our Hemisphere contains over half the world's biodiversity.  To
sustain the Hemisphere's social and economic development, we must
intensify efforts to understand, assess, and sustainably use this
living resource base.  We must act now to increase the technical
and management capacity and public awareness of national and
international efforts in this area.  Agenda 2l, the Convention on
Biological Diversity, and other related international instruments
recognize these needs and call for the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity resources.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Seek to ensure that strategies for the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity are integrated into relevant
economic development activities including forestry, agriculture,
and coastal zone management, taking into account the social
dimension and impact of these activities. <P>
<P>
Develop and implement the policies, techniques, and programs to
assess, conserve, and sustainably use terrestrial, marine, and
coastal biodiversity resources.<P>
<P>
Seek to ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity and pursue
opportunities for collaboration under it, and, as appropriate,
other international and regional environmental instruments.  <P>
<P>
Support democratic governmental mechanisms to engage public
participation, particularly including members of indigenous
communities and other affected groups, in the development of
policy involving conservation and sustainable use of natural
environments. The forms of this participation should be defined
by each individual country.<P>
<P>
Develop national plans and programs to establish and strengthen
the management of parks and reserves, seeking links to economic,
social, and ecological benefits for local people.<p>

Build capacity for the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity, through programs on management of parks and
protected areas, forests and wetlands management, the Small
Islands Developing States Action Plan, the Coral Reef Initiative,
CITES support projects, and the Caribbean Regional Marine
Pollution Action Plan, among others.<P>
<P>
Launch a "Decade of Discovery" to promote hemispheric technical
and scientific cooperation and to facilitate the exchange of
information relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity.  <P>
<P>
Increase support of training and education initiatives addressing
sustainable use of biodiversity resources and foster activities
by universities, non-governmental actors and organizations and
the private sector to assist in the training of managers and to
empower local communities.<P>
<P>
Call on multilateral financial institutions, including the IDB
and the Global Environment Facility, to support eligible regional
and national projects.<P>
<P>
Discuss progress on implementation of national and international
activities described above at the 1996 Summit Conference on
Sustainable Development in Bolivia, and at subsequent annual
sustainable development ministerials.<P>
<P>
<B>23.  Partnership for Pollution Prevention</B><P>
<P>
As recognized in Agenda 21, sound environmental management is an
essential element of sustainable development.  Cooperative
efforts are needed to develop or improve, in accordance with
national legislation and relevant international instruments:  (1)
frameworks for environment protection; and (2) mechanisms for
implementing and enforcing environmental regulations.  To achieve
this goal, a new partnership will promote cooperative activities
for developing environmental policies, laws, and institutions;
increasing technical capacity; promoting public awareness and
public participation; continuing to pursue technological,
financial and other forms of cooperation; and facilitating
information exchange, including on environmentally sound
technologies.  The activities of the partnership will build on
and advance the implementation of international agreements and
principles including those agreed to at the 1992 United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development and the 1994 Global
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States, in areas identified as priorities by countries
of the Hemisphere.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Strengthen and build technical and institutional capacity to
address environmental priorities such as pesticides, lead
contamination, pollution prevention, risk reduction, waste and
 sanitation issues, improved water and air quality, access to
safe drinking water, urban environmental problems, and to promote
public participation and awareness.<P>
<P>
Develop and implement national action plans to phase out lead in
gasoline.<P>
<P>
Strengthen national environmental protection frameworks and
mechanisms for implementation and enforcement, and include
sustainability criteria and objectives in national and other
development strategies.<P>
<P>
Undertake national consultations to identify priorities for
possible international collaboration.<P>
<P>
Support democratic governmental mechanisms to engage public
participation, particularly from members of indigenous and other
affected communities, in the consideration of policies regarding
the environmental impact of development projects and the design
and enforcement of environmental laws.<P>
<P>
Convene a meeting of technical experts, designated by each
interested country, to develop a framework for cooperative
partnership, building on existing institutions and networks to
identify priority projects.  These projects will initially focus
on (1) the health and environmental problems associated with the
misuse of pesticides, and (2) the impacts of lead contamination
from gasoline and other sources.  Subsequent activities could
address waste, air, water quality, marine pollution from ships
and other sources, and problems associated with urbanization.<P>
<P>
Promote the participation of organizations, such as the IDB, MIF,
the World Bank, PAHO, the OAS, and non-governmental actors and
organizations, as appropriate, to finance, develop and implement
priority projects.<P>
<P>
Develop environmental policies and laws with the goal of ensuring
that economic integration of the region occurs in an
environmentally sustainable manner.<P>
<P>
Establish mechanisms for cooperation among government agencies,
including in the legal and enforcement areas, to facilitate
environmental information exchange, technology cooperation and
capacity-building.<P>
<P>
Develop compatible environmental laws and regulations, at high
levels of environmental protection, and promote the
implementation of international environmental agreements.<P>
<P>
Discuss progress on implementation of international and national
activities described above at the 1996 Summit Conference on
Sustainable Development in Bolivia and at subsequent annual
sustainable development ministerials.<P>

<b>TEXT: BARSHEFSKY'S OPENING STATEMENT AT SINGAPORE WTO MINISTERIAL<br>
(U.S. aims for ITA, telecom and financial services talks)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says that if the World Trade Organization (WTO) succeeds in three important negotiations -- on information technology, basic telecommunication services and financial services -- it can build the infrastructure for a more interconnected global economy in the 21st century.

<p>Speaking December 9 at the opening session of the WTO's first ministerial meeting, Barshefsky, the chief U.S. trade policymaker, said that these negotiations provide an opportunity to prove to the world that the WTO is a vibrant institution laying the foundations for global prosperity.

<p>Barshefsky, who is heading the U.S. delegation to the December 9-13 WTO ministerial, added that the U.S. vision for the WTO extends beyond these three negotiations.  Specifically, she said that the agricultural trade liberalization begun by the WTO should continue through further cuts in tariffs and subsidies and the development of new safeguards against "disguised subsidies" and other forms of protectionism.

<p>She also called for full implementation of the WTO's trade-related aspects of intellectual property agreement (TRIPS) and said it is time to "take the first step" toward a WTO agreement on transparency in government procurement.

<p>Moreover, Barshefsky said the United States is prepared to consider whether the WTO should begin examining new issues.  She pointed out that this is why the United States has gone along with other countries that are interested in beginning modest WTO work programs in the areas of investment and competition.

<p>The United States, for its part, hopes to gain agreement that the WTO should, in cooperation with the International Labor Organization, examine in greater detail the relationship between trade and labor standards, Barshefsky stressed.  Basic human rights are the focus of the U.S. core labor standards proposal, she said.

<p>The following is the text of Ambassador Barshefsky's statement on behalf of the U.S. delegation, as prepared for delivery:

<p>(begin text)

<p>Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates.

<p>On behalf of the U.S. delegation, I want to express our appreciation to Prime Minister Goh, Minister Yeo and the Government of Singapore, General Council Chairman Rossier and Director General Ruggiero and his staff for their efforts to prepare for this historic, inaugural meeting of the World Trade Organization.  You have been gracious beyond measure -- and we are very grateful.

<p>Nearly 50 years ago, the formation of the GATT launched a period of trade liberalization unprecedented in world history.  Few present at that creation would have predicted the tremendous growth in world trade -- increasing 80 percent by volume in the last decade alone -- that has added immeasurably to the prosperity of the world's people.   GATT succeeded because we persisted in the goal of eliminating the barriers that deny our people the benefits of free and fair trade.  We saw new challenges, and we worked together to seize new opportunities.

<p>As we convene the first ministerial meeting of the WTO, our commitment to the ongoing work of trade liberalization must be equally determined.  We must prove to the world that the WTO is a vibrant institution laying the foundations for a new period of global prosperity.  Like our predecessors, we must seize new opportunities.

<p>The global economy will not wait for us.  Technological change is advancing rapidly -- all over the globe  -- in the West and in the East.  We salute the foresight of Prime Minister Mahathir for his vision to establish the Multimedia Super Corridor plan that will lead to an Information Technology city of 100,000 inhabitants as well as the creation of the world's first paperless national government by the year 2000.  The World Bank estimates that the world's economies will demand $1.5 trillion in capital over the next decade for  high quality infrastructure,  advanced information technology and telecommunications systems.

<p>We have an opportunity to meet these challenges.  If we can succeed in three important negotiations -- information technology, basic telecommunications services and financial services -- we can build the infrastructure for a more interconnected global economy of the 21st century.

<p>The first of these, the Information Technology Agreement, would be the first concrete demonstration of the WTO's ability to move forward in concert with the changing world around us.  By creating a tariff-free environment for trade in information technology products, we can help lower consumer costs, make our businesses more competitive and give our entire economies the benefits that flow from access to greater information.

<p>The biggest benefit may be to our economies more broadly.  These products increasingly are used in virtually every major industry sector.  The largest users of semiconductors world-wide are auto makers.  Computers and computer driven-machines increasingly are essential for textiles, apparel and steel manufacturing.   And we all know the vital role a modern telecommunications system plays in the growth of our economies.

<p>That's why we must reach an agreement this week.  Remaining issues are ripe for decision.  We have an historic opportunity to eliminate tariffs on these products.  We must seize it.

<p>Our second challenge is to proceed expeditiously  to conclude the basic telecommunications negotiations by February 15, 1997.  Investors increasingly seek predictability in telecommunications as part of a well-functioning international trade and investment regime.  Telecom is a strategic industry and a generator of economic growth and employment.  If we are successful in the WTO, basic telecom liberalization will spur investment and the use of new technologies in wider geographic and product areas.

<p>The United States and Europe have recently announced improvements to the offers tabled in the basic telecom negotiations, and we urge others to match our offers.  This is certainly our hope and expectation.  With such a short amount of time after this ministerial to conclude this negotiation, we hope all WTO members will contribute meaningfully to an agreement that provides market access and investment opportunities in the 21st century.

<p>But let me be clear.  Today, the United States accounts for nearly 50 percent of all telecom revenue worldwide.  We cannot, and we will not, settle for a situation where we are unable to operate in the other half of the world's markets.  We are ready to lead by making the first best offer, but we cannot succeed unless others come forward on a mutual basis.

<p>This leads me to the third set of critical negotiations -- financial services.  For our part, we are committed to achieving a comprehensive and meaningful agreement by the end of next year.  Our first try at the negotiations did not succeed.  Why?  Because the commitments of key countries were far below what was necessary to achieve a truly liberalizing agreement.  In fact, some countries would not even obligate themselves to their existing levels of liberalization.  To successfully conclude these talks, it is critical that WTO members significantly improve their commitments based on the GATS principles of market access, national treatment and MFN.

<p>We're convinced that an agreement is possible.  We can and should look more carefully at phase-in commitments, where appropriate, so there are assurances that after a reasonable period our financial services providers will enjoy substantially full market access and national treatment in key markets.  The benefits of binding open regimes in this sector should be clear: to achieve increased access to international capital and stronger "infrastructure" for continued investment and economic growth.

<p>If we can succeed in the ITA, the basic telecom negotiations, and in the upcoming financial services negotiations, we will have taken a major step toward building the kind of global economy that will benefit all of our citizens.

<p>Of course, our vision for the WTO extends beyond these three negotiations.  If the WTO is to stay relevant and responsive to new commercial realities, we must look ahead and create more market access opportunities, and, when necessary, create new rules.

<p>Work must continue in  many areas.  Those who already have benefited from the global trading system must find new ways for those less advantaged to reap the system's benefits.  We must continue the reform effort called for in the WTO agreement on agriculture.  In addition to encouraging further cuts in tariffs and subsidies, the WTO should develop disciplines against disguised subsidies and nontraditional forms of protection, such as the trade-restraining and non-transparent activities of state trading enterprises.  The TRIPs agreement should be fully implemented as rapidly as possible and existing obligations should be met now.  We also must continue efforts to ensure that the WTO is open and transparent.  Opening this ministerial to outside observers is a good step forward.  We will address these and other issues more fully in the working sessions.

<p>Public confidence in the integrity of government procurement decisions would be enhanced if all WTO countries agreed to basic standards of transparency and due process.  We believe this is the time to take the first step toward a WTO agreement on transparency in government procurement.

<p>The Committee on Trade and Environment must continue its work, recognizing the contribution that can be made to sustainable development when trade liberalization complements appropriate national environmental policies.  It is critical to the WTO's credibility that the Committee take a more balanced approach to dealing with trade and the environment, taking both policy perspectives fully into account.  Fulfilling the mandate for sustainable development which resulted from the Rio Summit demands more from the WTO than simply a committee.  The pursuit of sustainable growth and development should be a common thread woven throughout all the work of this organization.

<p>With regard to broadening the WTO's agenda, we are prepared to consider whether the WTO should begin careful examination of new issues some feel should be debated.  Like others, we are concerned about finding the right balance of interests.  That is why we have been willing to go along with others who wish to begin a modest work program in the areas of investment and competition, as part of a balanced overall agenda for the WTO.

<p>To remain viable, the WTO must reflect the needs of various constituencies involved in world trade.  Each of our economies will be facing more pressure from globalization in the coming years, and we must help workers adjust to and benefit from an open trading system. We must do more to acknowledge that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between an open trading system and respect for core labor standards.

<p>That is why we hope to have an agreement that the WTO should, in cooperation with the International Labor Organization, examine in greater detail the important nexus between trade and labor standards.  We believe strongly that increased trade and the economic growth that it brings should also engender greater respect for the basic human rights which are the focus of our core labor standards proposal.

<p>We are not proposing an agreement on minimum wages, changes that could take away the comparative advantage of low-wage producers, or the use of protectionist measures to enforce labor standards.  We are proposing that the concerns of working people -- people who fear that trade liberalization will lead to distortion -- be addressed in a modest work program in the WTO.  Trade liberalization can occur only with domestic support; that support, and support for the WTO, will surely erode if we cannot address the concerns of working people and demonstrate that trade is a path to tangible prosperity.

<p>We do not lack challenges as we look ahead, but I am highly optimistic.  This week we can send a strong message that the WTO is ready to move forward with will and determination, to become the strong, vibrant, and pragmatic institution we all want it to be.  With much hard work, we can continue the historic tradition of trade liberalization to which we are dedicated.

<b>TEXT:  HUNDT REPORTS PROGRESS ON GLOBAL TELECOM TALKS
<br>(FCC chair cites improved offers from Europe and Asia)</b><br>

<p>Washington -- Global talks on liberalizing trade in telecommunications services are making progress and could conclude successfully by their mid-February deadline, U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt said in a December 17 address.

<p>On a recent tour of Southeast Asia, Hundt said, "some additional progress was made in getting high-quality offers from our trading partners.  Several countries announced that they will improve their offers, including countries that account for more than a third of our international telecom traffic."

<p>"This gives us reason to hope that there will be significant progress before February 15," he added.

<p>The talks, conducted under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, were originally scheduled to conclude last April.  The United States refused to sign an agreement at the time "because not enough countries made high-quality offers of market access," Hundt said.  "Asian countries were particularly underrepresented."

<p>In addition to the progress made by Asian negotiators, Hundt said that the European Union had recently "joined the United States and improved its offer," as well.

<p>The worldwide trend, Hundt said, "is in favor of competition."

<p>He made the comments in an address to a forum on global telecommunications sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

<p>Following is the text of Hundt's remarks, as prepared for delivery:

<p>(begin text)

<p>Last week I met with President Fidel Ramos  of the Philippines to seek his support in the WTO telcom negotiations.  He told me that his vision was to use modern telecommunications to link military leaders of different nations so the day might come "when nation no more would make war upon nation."  Instead, we should all use our resources to ensure that our children are prepared to live in the 21st Century.

<p>In recent weeks, the world has made significant progress toward making President Ramos' vision a reality.  At the APEC summit, President Ramos, along with President Clinton, led the effort to build support for a global Information Technology Agreement.  And, as you have seen by the news out of Singapore in the last few days, the ITA negotiated by our United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, has now been brought to fruition.

<p>This is no small matter.  The products covered by the ITA are the cars and trucks that ride on the information highway and they include a broad range of goods -- computers, TV sets, the whole gamut of information appliances.  The global trade in these goods is now $500 billion a year.  Now that tariffs on these goods are to be eliminated, who can say how much that trade will grow?

<p>This is an accomplishment of which President Clinton, President Ramos, and Ambassador Barshefsky should be justly proud.  But there is a second, equally important initiative underway that will determine whether our children and our generals can expect to live in a peaceful, prosperous age.  And that is the effort to build the highway itself.  This highway will consist of the networks and the software that will allow the goods covered by the ITA to travel much faster and farther, as our interstate highway network did for the passenger vehicle.

<p>The highway, of course, will be built by private investment -- massive private investment all over the world.  But the capital for this needed investment will not flow if investors do not have the right to invest, or if they are unsure whether their investment will be secure.

<p>As you know, the WTO negotiations on basic telecommunications have been going on for over 2 1/2 years now.  We are officially in the home stretch to the February 15 deadline.

<p>This is significant, because this negotiation is not about the markets and technologies of the past.  It is about nothing less than building the Global Information highway.  The next two months will determine how quickly and how completely the highway will be built.

<p>But let me give you a little history of these talks, in case you haven't been following their progress closely.

<p>Almost three years ago in Buenos Aires, Vice President Gore called on the nations of the world to join us in building the GII.  The Vice President stressed at that time that private investment was essential to the construction of the Global Information highway.

<p>You will recall that President Clinton talked during his reelection campaign about building a bridge to the 21st Century.  There can be no question that the Global Information highway will be an important part of our efforts to prepare for the next millennium.

<p>The United States, together with all our major trading partners, has been in comprehensive discussions in Geneva about how we can all open and reform our markets to make the GII a reality.

<p>Last April, the United States refused to sign a bad deal.  In my view, the negotiation fell short then because too few governments were ready to embrace the inevitable future of this industry.  But my trip to Asia and to the Singapore ministerial confirms that the worldwide trend is in favor of competition.

<p>I believe there is one fundamental reason why this is so.  Competitive telecommunications services are crucial to economic development.  For years, the World Bank took the view that a telecommunications network was essentially a luxury that only developed economies could afford.  Today, even the World Bank recognizes that telecom is not a luxury, but a necessary tool for building a developed economy.

<p>Indeed, one of the things that distinguishes developed economies from developing economies is that the services sector accounts for more than half of developed economies, and more than 60% of the U.S. economy.  Telecom is a crucial input for both goods and services industries.  Of course, the world's financial institutions are among the heaviest users of telecommunications services.  Their industry now depends on the rapid and seamless transmission of reams of information.

<p>But, as I learned in Manila, even the Filipino asparagus farmer needs reliable and affordable telecommunications to run his business efficiently.

<p>The world today is divided between a relative handful of competitive telecom markets, and the vast majority of nations that are still in the thrall of monopoly.

<p>What are the consequences of this dichotomy?  Well, the principal consequence of free and fair competition in is economic growth.  For example:

<p>--  The information sector is 1/6 of the U.S. economy.  In the rest of the        world, it's more like 1/16.

<p>--  Over the last five years in the United States, 2 out of 3 new jobs in the economy as a whole -- 8 million new jobs -- have been created in the        information sector.

<p>--  Competitive markets, like the U.S. market, also produce a wider availability of services at lower prices, with greater choice for consumers.

<p>It's obvious that jobs in the 21st Century are going to be more information intensive than today's jobs.  The global economy is going to need high-quality, low cost telecom services in order to thrive.

<p>The legacy of monopoly, on the other hand, has been inadequate supply and high prices.  And nowhere is this more true than in the developing world.

<p>--  Two-thirds of the world's population has never made a phone call.

<p>--  Half the world's population lives two-days' walk from the nearest phone.

<p>--  In many countries, the waiting list for telephone service is ten years or more.

<p>Fortunately, all this is going to change, because it has to change.  Gradually, governments around the world are recognizing that in order to be competitive in the global economy, they will need modern, reliable telecom networks and services.  And a number of developing countries are already taking unilateral action to make it so.

<p>Today, the list may seem short, but already Chile, the Philippines, and Mexico have embraced competition.  More developing countries and emerging markets, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have taken limited steps to open their markets to competition and foreign investment.

<p>It would seem that all of these developments around the world dovetail nicely with the U.S. Government's objectives in the WTO basic telecom negotiations.  After all, we have made clear for more than two years now, that what we are seeking to do is to open markets -- especially our own -- to foreign investment and increased competition.

<p>As Vice President Gore said in Brussels almost two years ago, we are willing to eliminate barriers to foreign investment for all countries that are willing to do the same.  At the same time, it has been widely recognized that simply declaring competition is not enough to make effective competition happen.  Rather, governments will have to take action to make competition possible.

<p>So, where does this negotiation stand, with less than two months to go?

<p>The negotiation failed to conclude successfully back in April because not enough countries made high quality offers of market access.  Asian countries were particularly under-represented.  And, of course, it is precisely the booming economies of Asia that will be among the largest growth markets for telecommunications services in the years ahead.

<p>In the intervening months, our negotiators have made considerable progress in resolving remaining substantive issues concerning international services and satellites.  And, just a few weeks ago, the European Union joined the United States, and improved its offer.

<p>More recently, during my tour of Southeast Asia, I am pleased to announce, some additional progress was made in getting high quality offers from our trading partners.  Several countries announced that they will improve their offers, including countries that account for more than a third of our international telecom traffic.  We haven't seen the details of this, but this gives us reason to hope that there will be significant progress before February 15.

<p>Informally, we have had indications that other countries will improve their offers when the negotiations resume in January.

<p>Will all of this be enough to bring these talks, at long last, to a successful conclusion?  While it is still too early to say for sure, I believe, today, that there is reason for hope.

<p>First, the scope of these negotiations is broad.  The talks have covered not only POTS -- or, Plain Old Telephone Service -- but also the more advanced services that increasingly make up a major share of the bits riding on the information highway, everything from faxes, to data transmissions, to video.  After all, once it is on the network, a bit is a bit, so why shouldn't all carriers have an equal right to carry all the bits their customers care to send?

<p>Second, quite a few countries have already agreed to match our offer of unlimited rights for foreign investors.  These countries, largely in the developed world, have recognized that foreign investment is no threat to national security or to their own domestic enterprises.  Rather, foreign investment is essential to the building of truly world-class telecom infrastructures.

<p>It is not enough to simply declare competition and stand aside.  Entrenched monopolists in every market, including our own, continue to wield enormous market power.  For this reason, our negotiators in Geneva have worked out with their counterparts from 31 countries a sort of "gold standard" of regulation.  The pro-competitive regulatory principles that this group has agreed upon will make it possible for firms entering any of these markets to have a true opportunity to compete on a free and fair basis.  The fact that 31 countries have agreed to basic rules for competition in telecommunications is in itself a historic achievement.  It would be a shame to forfeit this progress.

<p>Having said all this, the path to a successful conclusion of these negotiations will not be simple.  If, in the end, all that can be agreed upon is an opening of markets that were already open, then we will have missed a great opportunity to bring most of the developing world along with us.  Likewise, if these talks degenerate into limited commitments to allow provision of yesterday's services -- but not tomorrow's -- then we will have missed a great opportunity to bring advanced telecom services to every corner of the globe.  And, finally, if too few countries guarantee investment rights, then the opportunity to build the global information highway may, itself, be lost.

<BODY>

<h5>SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS PLAN OF ACTION</h5><P>
<P>
<h4>I.  PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING THE COMMUNITY OF DEMOCRACIES OF
THE AMERICAS</h4><P>
<P>
1<b>.  Strengthening Democracy</b><P>
<P>
The strengthening, effective exercise and consolidation of
democracy constitute the central political priority of the
Americas.  The Organization of American States (OAS) is the
principal hemispheric body for the defense of democratic values
and institutions; among its essential purposes is to promote and
consolidate representative democracy, with due respect to the
principle of non-intervention.  The OAS has adopted multilateral
procedures to address the problems created when democratic order
has been interrupted unconstitutionally.  In order to prevent
such crises, the OAS needs to direct more effort toward the
promotion of democratic values and practices and to the social
and economic strengthening of already-established democratic
regimes.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Give expeditious consideration to ratifying the Cartagena de
Indias, Washington and Managua Protocols to the OAS Charter, if
they have not already done so.<P>
<P>
Strengthen the dialogue among social groups and foster grass
roots participation in problem solving at the local level.<P>
<P>
Support efforts by the OAS to promote democracy by:<P>
<P>
-- Encouraging exchanges of election-related technologies and
assisting national electoral organizations, at the request of the
interested state.<P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the Unit for the Promotion of Democracy so that
it can provide assistance at the request of the interested state
on such matters as legislative and judicial processes, government
reforms (including administration of justice, technical
modernization of national legislative bodies, simplification of
government regulations and promotion of participation by
community organizations in local democracy), and other
institutional changes.<P>
<P>
-- Encouraging opportunities for exchange of experiences among
member states' democratic institutions, particularly legislature-
to-legislature and judiciary-to-judiciary.<P>
<P>
-- Fostering understanding, dialogue and political
reconciliation, at the request of the affected state and bearing
in mind that national reconciliation comes from within.<P>
<P>
-- Requesting the OAS to promote and follow up on these
 commitments.
<P>
<b>2.  Promoting and Protecting Human Rights</b><P>
<P>
Great progress has been made in the Hemisphere in the development
of human rights concepts and norms, but serious gaps in
implementation remain.  While courts ultimately have the
responsibility for enforcing legal rights and obligations,
reforms in other institutions are needed to contribute to the
further development of a climate of respect for human rights. 
There must also be universal access to justice and effective
means to enforce basic rights.  A democracy is judged by the
rights enjoyed by its least influential members.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Give serious consideration to adherence to international human
rights instruments to which they are not already party.<P>
<P>
Cooperate fully with all United Nations and inter-American human
rights bodies.<P>
<P>
Develop programs for the promotion and observance of human
rights, including educational programs to inform people of their
legal rights and their responsibility to respect the rights of
others.<P>
<P>
Promote policies to ensure that women enjoy full and equal legal
rights within their families and societies, and to ensure the
removal of constraints to women's full participation as voters,
candidates and elected and appointed officials.<P>
<P>
Review and strengthen laws for the protection of the rights of
minority groups and indigenous people and communities to ensure
freedom from discrimination, to guarantee full and equal
protection under the law, and to facilitate active civic
participation. Support a process to review and enhance the
protection o of indigenous rights in OAS member states and to
develop promptly an effective United Nations declaration on
indigenous rights.<P>
<P>
Review national legislation affecting people with disabilities,
as well as benefits and services for them, and make any changes
needed to facilitate the enjoyment by these individuals of the
same rights and freedoms as other members of society.<P>
<P>
Undertake all measures necessary to guarantee the rights of
children, and, where they have not already done so, give serious
consideration to ratifying the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child.<P>
<P>
Guarantee the protection of the human rights of all migrant
workers and their families.<P>
<p>
Take the necessary steps to remedy inhumane conditions in prisons
and to minimize the number of pretrial detainees.<P>
<P>
Review training curricula for law enforcement agents to ensure
that they adequately cover proper treatment of suspects and
detainees as well as relations with the community.<P>
<P>
Exchange experiences on protection of human rights at the
national level and, where possible, cooperate in the development
of law enforcement and security force training or other programs
to reduce the potential for human rights violations.<P>
<P>
Call on the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to
establish or to reinforce programs, as appropriate, to support
national projects for the promotion and observance of human
rights in the Western Hemisphere.<P>
<P>
Further strengthen the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.<P>
<P>
<b>3.  Invigorating Society/Community Participation</b><P>
<P>
A strong and diverse civil society, organized in various ways and
sectors, including individuals, the private sector, labor,
political parties, academics, and other non-governmental actors
and organizations, gives depth and durability to democracy. 
Similarly, a vigorous democracy requires broad participation in
public issues. Such activities should be carried out with
complete transparency and accountability, and to this end a
proper legal and regulatory framework should be established to
include the possibility of obtaining technical and financial
support, including from private sources.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Review the regulatory framework for non-governmental actors with
a view to facilitating their operations and promoting their
ability to receive funds.  This review will emphasize the
management and oversight of resources as well as transparency and
the accountability to society of said actors.<P>
<P>
Take steps to improve the participation in social activities and
initiatives of groups traditionally marginalized, including
women, youth, indigenous people and the extremely poor.<P>
<P>
Exchange progress reports on activities in the civil society area
at the 1996 Summit Conference on Sustainable Development in
Bolivia.<P>
<P>
Consider the development by the IDB of a new Civil Society
Program to encourage responsible and accountable philanthropy and
civic engagement in public policy issues.<P>
<P>
<b>4. Promoting Cultural Values</b><p>

Cultural development is a fundamental and integral component of
development in the Americas and has an inherent capability to
enrich our societies and to generate greater understanding among
our countries.<P>
<P>
In order to promote cultural values, governments will:<P>
<P>
Encourage more dynamic relations among public and private
institutions and organizations, including universities, museums,
and centers of art and literature, as well as among individual
cultural actors.  Such exchanges emphasize our cultural
diversity, recognize the value of our local cultures and
contribute to improving hemispheric understanding.<P>
<P>
Request that the OAS and IDB reinforce their plans and programs
to facilitate these cultural exchanges and the flow of cultural
and historical information within and among our nations.<P>
<P>
<b>5.  Combating Corruption</b><P>
<P>
The problem of corruption is now an issue of serious interest not
only in this Hemisphere, but in all regions of the world.
Corruption in both the public and private sectors weakens
democracy and undermines the legitimacy of governments and
institutions.  The modernization of the state, including
deregulation, privatization and the simplification of government
procedures, reduces the opportunities for corruption.  All
aspects of public administration in a democracy must be
transparent and open to public scrutiny.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Promote open discussion of the most significant problems facing
government and develop priorities for reforms needed to make
government operations transparent and accountable.<P>
<P>
Ensure proper oversight of government functions by strengthening
internal mechanisms, including investigative and enforcement
capacity with respect to acts of corruption, and facilitating
public access to information necessary for meaningful outside
review.<P>
<P>
Establish conflict of interest standards for public employees and
effective measures against illicit enrichment, including stiff
penalties for those who utilize their public position to benefit
private interests.<P>
<P>
Call on the governments of the world to adopt and enforce
measures against bribery in all financial or commercial
transactions with the Hemisphere; toward this end, invite the OAS
to establish liaison with the OECD Working Group on Bribery in
International Business Transactions.<P>
<P>
Develop mechanisms of cooperation in the judicial and banking
 areas to make possible rapid and effective response in the
international investigation of corruption cases.<P>
<P>
Give priority to strengthening government regulations and
procurement, tax collection, the administration of justice and
the electoral and legislative processes, utilizing the support of
the IDB and other international financial institutions where
appropriate.<P>
<P>
Develop within the OAS, with due regard to applicable treaties
and national legislation, a hemispheric approach to acts of
corruption in both the public and private sectors that would
include extradition and prosecution of individuals so charged,
through negotiation of a new hemispheric agreement or new
arrangements within existing frameworks for international
cooperation.<P>
<P>
<b>6. Combating the Problem of Illegal Drugs and Related Crimes</b><P>
<P>
The problems of illegal drug and related criminal activities pose
grave threats to the societies, free market economies, and
democratic institutions of the Hemisphere.  Drug use imposes
enormous social costs; drug money and income are net drains on
economic growth; and drug lords and criminal organizations
endanger the security of our people through corruption,
intimidation, and violence.  While drug trafficking continues to
be a significant source of illegal funds, the money laundering
industry increasingly deals with the proceeds of all types of
criminal activity.  An integrated and balanced approach that
includes respect for national sovereignty is essential to
confront all aspects of these problems. For these reasons, a
broad coordinated hemispheric strategy to reduce drug use and
production, including new enforcement methods that can disrupt
drug trafficking and money laundering networks and prosecute
those engaged in such activities, is required.  In this context,
governments note the work of the 1992 San Antonio Summit, endorse
the efforts of the Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse
Control, and agree to work together to formulate a counter-
narcotics strategy for the 21st Century.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Ratify the 1988 United Nations Convention Against the Illicit
Traffic of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances and make it a
criminal offense to launder the proceeds of all serious
crimes.<P>
<P>
Enact legislation to permit the freezing and forfeiture of the
proceeds of money laundering and consider the sharing of
forfeited assets among governments.<P>
<P>
As agreed by ministers and representatives of Caribbean and Latin
American governments in the Kingston Declaration, November 5-6,
1992, implement the recommendations of the Caribbean Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering and work to adopt the Model
 Regulations of the Inter-American Commission on Drug Abuse
Control (CICAD). <P>
<P>
Encourage financial institutions to report large and suspicious
transactions to appropriate authorities and develop effective
procedures that would allow the collection of relevant
information from financial institutions.<P>
<P>
Work individually and collectively to identify the region's
narcotics trafficking and money laundering networks, prosecute
their leaders, and seize assets derived from these criminal
activities.<P>
<P>
Adopt programs to prevent and reduce the demand for and the
consumption of illicit drugs.<P>
<P>
Adopt effective and environmentally-sound national strategies to
prevent or reduce substantially the cultivation and processing of
crops used for the illegal drug trade, paying particular
attention to national and international support for development
programs that create viable economic alternatives to drug
production.<P>
<P>
Pay particular attention to the control of precursor chemicals
and support comprehensive drug interdiction strategies.<P>
<P>
Strengthen efforts to control firearms, ammunition, and
explosives to avoid their diversion to drug traffickers and
criminal organizations.<P>
<P>
Hold a working-level conference, to be followed by a ministerial
conference, to study and agree on a coordinated hemispheric
response, including consideration of an inter-American
convention, to combat money laundering.<P>
<P>
Convene a hemispheric-wide conference of donors, including
multilateral development banks and UN agencies, to seek resources
for alternative development programs aimed at curbing the
production, trafficking, and use of illicit drugs, and the
rehabilitation of addicts.<P>
<P>
Support the discussion the OAS has initiated with the European
Union on measures to control precursor chemicals.<P>
<P>
Support the convening of a global counter-narcotics
conference.<P>
<P>
<b>7. Eliminating the Threat of National and International
Terrorism</b><P>
<P>
National and international terrorism constitute a systematic and
deliberate violation of the rights of individuals and an assault
on democracy itself.  Recent attacks that some of our countries
have suffered have demonstrated the serious threat that terrorism
poses to security in the Americas.  Actions by governments to
combat and eliminate this threat are essential elements in
 guaranteeing law and order and maintaining confidence in
government, both nationally and internationally.  Within this
context, those who sponsor terrorist acts or assist in their
planning or execution through the abuse of diplomatic privileges
and immunities or other means will be held responsible by the
international community.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Promote bilateral and subregional agreements with the aim of
prosecuting terrorists and penalizing terrorist activities within
the context of the protection of human rights and fundamental
freedoms.<P>
<P>
Convene a special conference of the OAS on the prevention of
terrorism.<P>
<P>
Reaffirm the importance of the extradition treaties ratified by
the states of the Hemisphere, and note that these treaties will
be strictly complied with as an expression of the political will
of governments, in accordance with international law and domestic
legislation.<P>
<P>
<b>8.  Building Mutual Confidence</b><P>
<P>
The expansion and consolidation of democracy in the Americas
provide an opportunity to build upon the peaceful traditions and
the cooperative relationships that have prevailed among the
countries of the Western Hemisphere.  Our aim is to strengthen
the mutual confidence that contributes to the economic and social
integration of our peoples.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Support actions to encourage a regional dialogue to promote the
strengthening of mutual confidence, preparing the way for a
regional conference on confidence-building measures in 1995,
which Chile has offered to host.<P>
