Public-Sector Unions and Privatization 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 29, 1996</i><p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>	
<blockquote>
We'd like to introduce the Carolan-Keating law of public policy.  It serves as a thumb-nail measure of how much support or opposition a public policy initiative deserves: If public-sector-union officials strongly oppose an initiative then it's worthy of support, and anything they support is worth opposing.	Public-sector unions thrive on big government.  The more taxpayer money government spends, the more jobs and influence for unions.  And since union membership is on the decline in the private sector, government serves as the last bastion of unions.  	
<P>
Therefore, sound public policy steps, like tax cuts, deregulation, school choice, and spending reductions, attract vehement opposition from public-sector unions.  In fact, as we have seen in New York in recent years, these unions often resort to hyperbolic television, radio, and newspaper scare ads.  	The issue riling unions most today is privatization.  Indeed, if you want to liven up the next cocktail party you're attending, find a public-sector-union official, mention privatization, and watch the sparks fly.  (We have, and it's great sport!)	Privatization means selling government-owned assets or shifting services completely out of the realm of government and into the private sector.  The taxpayers no longer possess any ties to the asset or service.  A step child to privatization is competitive contracting, whereby private enterprises regularly bid to provide services while taxpayers still foot the bill.  	
<P>
The benefits of privatization and competitive contracting are clear: 1) selling assets generates revenues that should be applied to debt retirement or rainy day funds, 2) shifting services completely to the private sector relieves taxpayers of the costs, and improves the quality of those services through competition and the profit motive, 3) in the case of pure privatization, government stops competing with private businesses, and 4) allowing companies to compete to provide services saves taxpayer dollars.	However, privatization has had a particularly rough time in New York, the number one union state in the country.  Almost 29 percent of all workers in New York are union members -- highest proportion in the nation and almost twice the national average.  	
<P>
Nonetheless, Governor Pataki at times musters the courage to utter the "p" word.  For example, the Governor has pushed for privatizing state-owned Stewart Airport.  Even New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has tested the privatization waters by putting the U.N. Plaza Hotel up for sale.  And the New York-New Jersey Port Authority actually privatized its Vista Hotel in Manhattan for more than $140 million.  (That's right, government in New York owns and operates hotels!)	Activists Ron Lauder and Allen Roth deserve considerable credit for teaching the privatization gospel in New York.  Unfortunately, the Democrats express no interest in privatization -- unwilling to offend their union supporters -- and Republicans often forget their lessons.  For example, in complete contrast to the privatization movement, Governor Pataki supports a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)!	Much can and needs to be privatized at both the state and local levels in New York.  
<P>
Candidates for privatization are numerous, including public housing (sell it or even give it away), airports, horse race tracks, Off-Track Betting (patronage mill and retirement home for politicians), golf courses (New York State owns 18 with many more owned by counties, cities and towns), marinas, ski resorts (the state owns Gore and Whiteface Mountain ski centers), theaters, stadiums (don't build new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees, privatize Yankee and Shea Stadiums), buildings (how about the World Trade Center?), arenas (Nassau Coliseum -- home to the New York Islanders), mass transit services (buses, trains and subways), convention centers, hospitals, and prisons.  
<P>
Competitive contracting opportunities are widespread as well, such as operating state and local parks, trash pick up, road maintenance and snow removal, workfare programs, and more.  	Oh, and of course, after the state takes over LILCO, that too will be a candidate for privatization.	In addition to saving taxpayer dollars and improving services, very often workers find expanded opportunity through privatization that would not exist in a straightforward government job.  In fact, the only clear losers under privatization are the officials who sit atop public-sector unions.  Clear proof supporting the Carolan-Keating law of public policy.

Lotto Fever Spells Social Decline 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 22, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p> <br>
<blockquote>
</center>
	Last week, Governor Pataki announced a change in the advertising campaign for the New York State Lottery.  The new tack will focus on Lotto's benefits to education, and drop the "get-rich-quick" theme. Perpetuating such an image, the Governor says, "is not the proper role for government."	Like so many New York Republicans who talk about reducing the role of government, but do little, Governor Pataki comes to the right church, but sits in the wrong pew.	Changing an ad campaign merely alters appearances, not substance.  The reason to play any game of chance, even one run by the state, is to try to win money.  Being told the money will benefit education acts as a mere palliative -- and amounts to a budgetary lie.	The lottery's net receipts of $1.5 billion is like all other money: fungible.  If friends give you a new car, you no longer have to save for that car.  Your money in the bank is freed up for other things.  The same occurs in Albany.  Lotto frees up money for pork-barrel projects -- education related and otherwise.  Indeed, by creating the appearance of an ever-growing stream of revenue aimed at schools, the lottery allows Albany to abdicate responsibility for a cost-effective public school system.	
As we have argued elsewhere, the surest path to better education is to end government's monopoly and institute school choice.  Costs would fall, while service improves. 	We hear that the lottery also helps small businesses, such as bars, stationary stores, luncheonettes, etc., stay afloat -- more fiscal fiction.  The best way to boost business remains by cutting the sales tax, the business tax, capital gains and personal income taxes, as well as all those crushing fees and regulations.	The perpetuation of lottery games in New York indicates a government that can't stop spending.  Instead, the state comes up with more and more baroque schemes for bilking the taxpayer.  From the original creation of one Lottery game in 1966, we have seen an explosion of new games: Lotto Take Five (twice a week); Lotto 54 (twice a week); Three Digit Daily Number; Daily Number "Win 4"; Instant Scratch-Off games with silly themes like Luck of the Irish, etc.; and Keno games like Pick 10 and the now infamous "Quick Draw."	Have you ever been in a bar or restaurant where Quick Draw is played?  It's a sorry spectacle, where hard-working folks drop $10, $20, or $50 a night playing the game, with all the rational deliberation that a few beers will bring.  No wonder so many family groups across the state oppose Quick Draw. 	And we've all heard the whispers about low-income individuals lining up to spend what little money they have on the state's games of chance, desperately hoping to escape the cycle of poverty.  In contrast, a good education and a bustling employment market would make a real difference in people's lives. 
<P>
 Unfortunately, New York's big government obstructs such developments.	George Will once described the lottery as "a tax on fools," a way of encouraging people to believe they can get ahead by something other than hard work, education, and moral self-improvement.  While we all have our own little vices -- human nature being human nature -- should our government prey upon such weaknesses?	What's more, a lottery game can only flourish in a society where people have religious faith -- a belief in a power higher than themselves. Nearly everybody who's bought a Lotto ticket has thought to themselves at one time or another, "I know God will help me out here, because He knows my desperate situation. He knows I will do some good with this money."  The lottery exploits that belief in divine providence. It encourages spiritual solipsism, where folks think they are the only ones in God's kind universe. Is that what we want our government to do?	Try fitting that into an ad campaign, Governor.

New York Pork</b>

<blockquote>
Tax time has come and gone once again.  How much Albany demands in state personal and business taxes never fails to shock us.  If the morose effects of your tax bill are beginning to fade, however, allow us to send you back into deep depression with the bad news about where much of your precious money ends up year after budget year.	How about $50,000 going to the "East End Economic and Environmental Institute Wine Symposium," $50,000 to a "grape entomologist," or $150,000 to a zoo in Utica?  There's also $2,000 to the New York City Sailing Association; $25,000 to buy bleachers for parks in Ohio, NY; $12,500 for a bike path on Grand Island; and $21,500 for the Attica Rodeo and Show Association.	 The list seems never ending: $300,000 for a design and construction study for the Sports and Entertainment Center on Long Island, $10,000 for the Museum of Television and Radio, $348,200 for the "Dairy Farm Productivity and Profitability Project," $1,840 to the Leisure Club of Mineola, $250,000 for the National Soccer Hall of Fame, and $25,000 to PAWS, the Protection Animal Welfare Society (how cute).	Welcome, dear New Yorkers, to the world of "member items," pork-barrel spending that has become so ingrained in the life of Republicans and Democrats in Albany no one bothers question it any more.  
<P>
The items above are but a smidgen of what can be found in New York State budgets over the last three years. The actual amount of member-items waste runs into the tens of millions of dollars per year.	Supporters call it the cost of getting things done, "greasing the wheels of democracy," if you will.  We call it greasing the palms of special interests.  Next time you hear state politicians bleating about apocalyptic budget cuts and the resulting "devastation," remember these and countless other pork items in the annual state budget.	This year, because of the federal budget impasse, Albany has decided to snooze waiting for Bill Clinton, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich to come to terms and determine how much federal taxpayer money and savings will come New York's way.  Continuing resolutions will do nothing to attack the real problems of New York's profligate spending.  And since a finalized federal budget seems unlikely until after the November elections, it's time for our friends in Albany to get to work, changing the priorities of the Empire State.  
<P>
It's time to say good-bye not only to member items, but to entire departments of state government.	For example, the state could eliminate each of its so-called "economic development" agencies with no negative impact on New York's economy.  In fact, to the contrary, the state economy would benefit.  On the chopping block (proposed 1996-97 budgets in parentheses) should be the Department of Economic Development ($55.2 million), the Empire State Development Corporation ($124.2 million), the Energy and Development Authority ($57.9 million), New York State Science and Technology Foundation ($24 million), Department of Agriculture and Markets ($65.9 million), Division of Housing and Community Renewal ($253.7 million), and the Olympic Regional Development Authority ($10.8 million) with its two state ski resorts.  	After all, market promotion, loans, housing construction, commercial research, running ski resorts, and venture capital investment are better left to individuals and entrepreneurs in the marketplace rather than to state bureaucrats.  State government should not be competing with private-sector firms.  These state development agencies merely supply patronage jobs for the relatives, friends, and political associates of elected officials, serving as unadulterated wastes of taxpayer dollars.	Funding of the arts should be left to the private sector as well.  Eliminating the state's Council on the Arts and funding for public television and radio would save about $47 million.  	
<P>
We've only scratched the surface by mentioning a few departments ready for termination.  Billions of dollars in cuts are available in the really big state departments, like Education, Labor, Health, Transportation, Parks, and Social Services.	New Yorkers need to do more than complain about their taxes each April.  They've got to make the link between big government and high taxes.  In a state budget topping $63 billion, myriad opportunities for savings exist.  Alas though, deep spending and tax cuts won't happen until the voters start sending legislators to Albany who realize that government is merely a necessary evil, not a pinata stuffed with goodies waiting to be broken open each year.

The Case for Competition in Education
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<P>
<i>April 8, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
     In a recent Washington Post article, Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman warned of a growing danger in American society. We are, he said, splitting into two types of people: those who are well-educated and highly skilled -- the"cognitive elite" -- and those who are being left behind by our current educational system -- low-skilled, poorly educated, and unable to compete technologically and politically in a rapidly changing world.    
<P>
 The legendary Gordon Moore of Intel, who famously predicted the rapid technological change brought on the by the microchip, expresses similar concerns.     These men, and others, are not worried about technical or vocational skills per se. They are concerned about the way our society is changing from an industrial to an information-based society.  A society making more demands on the minds, and less on the muscles of future American workers. These workers will need like never before the power to read, write, think critically, and master advanced concepts.     
<P>
Our school system, however, has shown that it is not up to the task.  In New York, while inflation-adjusted per pupil public school expenditures have increased by 80 percent since the early 1970s, SAT scores have plummeted from 937 in 1972 to 892 in 1995.  New York once exceeded the national average SAT score, but now trails considerably.      When you add in the high incidence of rape, robbery, drug abuse, teacher assault, and vandalism in schools, especially in the inner-city, as well as a dramatic increase in remedial courses at the college level designed to clean up English and math skills, it is clear our educational system, and America, is in trouble.     
<P>
The reason?  An educational monopoly, dominated by the world's most powerful special interests: the National Educational Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and here, the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT). The money these groups spend to maintain the status quo is staggering.  Indeed, in Albany, no other special interest group is better financed or wields greater power, over both Democrats and Republicans, than the education unions.     
<P>
Unlike people who work in private industry, where one must produce to make a living, the educational monopoly stifles performance.  Under collective bargaining, bad teachers are protected, good teachers receive no incentives.  What's worse, it's very hard to take a child out of the system.  Parents who look for a better educational product in our private schools still must pay once in taxes to fund the bad school and then once again in tuition.  Of course, public schools possess no incentives to cut costs.     
<P>
As we have found about New York, cost per pupil in public school districts can be astronomical.  The lowest cost in New York, based on 1992-93 figures, was $5,395 in the Portville school district.  But about half the districts in New York spend more than $8,000 annually, 25 percent spend more than $10,000, seven districts even spend more than $20,000, with two districts on Long Island -- Bridgehampton and Fire Island -- exceeding a whopping $31,000 per student!  Compare that with the average cost per pupil of private schools, somewhere around $3000.     
<P>
Giving parents a choice in education, through a system of vouchers or tax credits is the only way to break free from the educational monopoly, and renew American education.  And it is a proposal that is beginning to take hold across the country, what Milton Friedman sees as an impending tidal wave.  School choice plans are now in place in 20 states and the District of Columbia -- some privately financed and others through taxpayer dollars.       
<P>
In New York State, a bill called "The Elementary and Secondary Education Improvement Act" is now in committee.  While it still has a long way to go, signs are hopeful. C&K hears rumors that Governor Pataki supports school choice, and the Conservative Party has made choice part of it's Contract with New York for the fall elections.     Teachers' union officials have not yet launched a full scale assault on the bill, but according to sources in Albany, union lobbyists have been "dropping by" legislators' offices, hoping perhaps to strangle the bill in the cradle.  The growth in popularity of the measure must have them worried. Originally introduced in 1993 with only State Senator Serphin Maltese as a sponsor, the bill has grown each year, to its current level of 18 co-sponsors.     
<P>
Tim Mulhearn, of United New Yorkers for Choice in Education, and one of the architects of the bill, and Don Woods, of Citizens for Excellence in Education, think that once some minor changes are made to protect home schoolers and religious-school identity, the conservative coalition across New York will mobilize on behalf of the measure.     They also note, though, that this is not a conservative issue alone. Even some liberals like Assemblyman Dov Hikind are supporting the bill.  And why not?  Shouldn't everyone, not just the wealthy, have access to excellence in education?     As Milton Friedman notes, the private sector has done more to improve the standard of living in the last 200 years then all government could do in the previous 2000. It's time to completely unleash that power in education, as New York and America head into a challenging new era.

NY Baseball and the Stench of Corporate Welfare
</b>
<p>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p>
<i>April 1, 1996</i>
</center><P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote>

	The crack of the bat, the neatly mowed grass, the call for "hot dogs" -- professional baseball is back New York.  Unfortunately, so is the odor of corporate welfare and stadium socialism.  Politicians stand ready to subsidize baseball's millionaire owners and athletes with taxpayer dollars --  a sad trend stretching across the state and the country.
<p>	
Take New York City's professional teams for instance.  The Mets and Yankees are crying out for new, taxpayer-financed venues to replace the city-owned stadiums that currently house them.	The Mets seek an Ebbets Field-style ballpark, with modern amenities like a retractable dome.  The total cost will likely top $400 million, with the Mets reportedly looking for New York City -- i.e., taxpayers -- to foot about $100 million of the bill.  	
<P>
That's a bargain compared to what George Steinbrenner wants for his Yankees, anything from a mere $400 million upgrade to the current Yankee Stadium to a new ballpark on Manhattan's west side where costs could easily reach more than $1 billion.  Don't expect too much, if anything, in the way of stadium dollars from Steinbrenner, who stands ready to bolt with his team to eager New Jersey if he doesn't get a good deal.	Stadium socialism is not limited to just New York City and major league teams, however.  Two years ago, state taxpayers forked over more than $110 million for minor league stadium improvements or completely new ballparks across the state.  Tens of millions of state dollars were allocated for facilities in places like Syracuse, Auburn, Batavia, Dutchess County, Elmira, Jamestown, Oneonta, Utica, Watertown, and even for the Hall of Fame Stadium in Cooperstown.   	
<P>
The Rochester Red Wings, for example, claimed poverty when their league required them to upgrade Silver Stadium, which they owned.  So the state came up with $15.3 million for a new ballpark.  The Red Wings will move into Frontier Field next year.  On Long Island, the Long Island Ducks of the new Atlantic League of Professional Baseball -- who have yet to play a game -- are looking for $15 million in government funding for a new stadium.
	Supporters of taxpayer funding claim that the economy receives a huge boost from such facilities.   The story goes that government spends money on a ballpark, families spend money at the game, and this money than multiplies activity throughout the economy.  Unfortunately, such a dreamy scenario leaves out a few important details.  Government must take the money from somewhere else -- through taxes -- to build the ballpark, thereby raising costs for individuals, families and businesses, and dampening economic activity.  And, with government bureaucrats not subject to the disciplines of the marketplace, as private sector entrepreneurs are, waste in government springs eternal.  Politicians also ignore what economists call the substitution effect, which tells us that families will spend their leisure dollars one way or another, if not at a ball game, then on a movie or at a concert.  There's no net economic gain from government stadium building.  Considering the boost in taxes and government's wasteful ways, it's likely a net economic loss.
<P>
  	Even some politicians acknowledge they can't find solid economic grounds for spending on new stadiums.  John Riley, from the Monroe County Executive's office, admitted to C&K: "You would be hard pressed to find a direct economic benefit from the construction of a stadium."  In a recent interview, a top New York City official explained to us that sorting out the economic benefits of a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's west side would be a daunting task.	Until the 1950s and 1960s, the private sector was the source of new stadiums and it worked quite well.  Now, however, we have political sentiment and intuition, and few facts.  Officials can only say that government ballparks enhance the "quality of life" -- a rather nebulous concept for which to spend tens, if not hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.	Dave Howard, a spokesman for the Mets, told C&K that "given the cost of doing business in New York" there's "no way" that financing a new stadium for the Mets "can be done privately."  However, after being rejected by the voters four times for new taxpayer-financed stadiums in recent years, the San Francisco Giants just received a zoning clearance from San Francisco voters in order to build a new, privately financed ballpark in the China Basin.  And the cost of doing business in San Francisco -- another high tax city -- is quite burdensome. 
<P>
Stadiums surely can be privately financed, but why would team owners and league officials take the private route when politicians are willing to pass the costs on to the taxpayer?  As the old saying goes, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?  The answer to New York's high "cost of doing business" is downsizing government.  A good place to start is saying no to subsidizing baseball teams.  Privatizing ballparks already in government hands would be the next logical step.  It's time to put "For Sale" signs out on New York's ballparks.  Then we can all enjoy a ball game, free from the stench of corporate welfare.

	The New York State budget will be late once again, missing the April 1 deadline for the twelfth year in a row.  But there is a silver lining in the budget battles of the last two years.   The debate is starting to shift in Albany, from squabbles over pork, which held up previous budgets, to discussions about the nature and size of government.	Credit the conservative instincts of Governor George Pataki for the change.  Surfing a wave of anti-Cuomo, pro-tax-cut sentiment into the Governor's Mansion in 1994, Pataki immediately sought to reverse the growth trend in state spending, and implement even deeper tax cuts than those scheduled years earlier but not delivered by Cuomo and the state legislature.
<p>
	In his first budget last year, Pataki proposed a four-year tax-cut centered around a reduction in the top personal income tax rate from 7.875% to 5.9%, as well as spending restraint not seen in New York in a half-century.  The Governor was thwarted somewhat by that silver-tongued orator Speaker Sheldon Silver and his Assembly Democrats, as well as a few Senate Republicans, who whittled down Pataki's tax rate cut to just 6.85% by 1997.  Still, combined with a modest increase in spending, only 2.3% (below the rate of inflation), last year was not a bad kickoff to the Pataki Administration, even with a late budget.
<P>
	This year the task is just as daunting.  Pataki is proposing a mere 0.4% increase in total state spending and the next phase of his tax cut takes effect.  The Governor should be commended for his budget actions.   Let's remember, though, even under the Pataki plan, the state budget still stands at a staggering $63.8 billion.  If we're serious about turning New York's economy around, the Pataki initiatives should be treated as first steps, with deeper tax cuts and budget savings needed.	Still, Pataki faces numerous structural and political obstacles.  First, there's the budget battle in Washington, which throws a monkey wrench into any budget calculations the Governor has made.  Once again,  there are the Assembly Democrats, and their supporting special-interests cabal of unions, social workers, public school bureaucrats, etc.  Expect them to ratchet up the pressure even higher when the savings from Washington, D.C. that the Governor's budget counts on fail to materialize.  They'll push harder to delay the Pataki tax cut and boost state spending.
<P>
	Given the poor track record of Senate Republicans, who failed to stand up for scheduled tax reductions each year from 1990 through 1994, the Governor may be alone in defense of his tax plan.  To his credit, Pataki consistently voted against budgets that broke tax-cut pledges as a state assemblyman and senator.  Now his mettle will be put to the test as Governor.	Some structural changes would help.  First, the Governor should unhoist himself from his own petard. Open up the budget process, even if it means devolving power.  Take the budget out of the hands of the Big 3, the Governor, Assembly Speaker and Senate Majority Leader.  Unleash the media (other than us) on the full legislature, and its pork-barrel dealings.  As the good book says, "Those who live in darkness hate the light."	
<P>
Second, turn to the state Constitution, something which naturally arouses public interest.  The Governor already has started down this path, proposing an amendment which would require that an austerity budget, equal to 90% of the prior year's appropriations, take effect automatically if the April 1 budget deadline is missed. The governor also has proposed an amendment requiring a super-majority vote in each house to raise taxes by more than $50 million a year.  But why not a super-majority to raise taxes at all?	Third, Pataki should make amends for his support of the deeply flawed debt reform measure of 1995 -- wisely rejected by the voters -- by bringing greater attention to the real problem of long-term debt.  I.e., how it has been accumulated by myriad public authorities without voter approval, how the state constitution forbids it, and how judges have been too lenient in allowing it.	
<P>
Finally, act "gubernatorial." For one thing, drop the silly squabbling with Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Lt. Governor.  Get her out publicly and prominently supporting the budget.  She is telegenic, more recognizable than Stan Lundine ever was, and she even unnerves Sheldon Silver.  This can only help the Pataki Administration gain some much-need "stature" as a harmonious unit, rather than appearing petty and disorganized.	The fortunes of New York are tied to the fortunes of George Pataki.  If he grows as a leader and tax cutter, New York stands a chance to actually prosper, something we haven't done in a very long time.

<P><br><b>
Who Would a Flat Tax Hurt in NY -- the People or Politicians?
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p><i>March 11,1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<P><br></center>
<blockquote>
	Under the iron hand of Senator Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republicans delivered the state's March 7 primary to Senator Bob Dole, and dealt a death blow to the now defunct presidential campaign of Steve Forbes.  Along the way, New York Republican leaders hurled slurs at Forbes' central campaign issue -- a 17% flat tax to replace our current federal income tax system.	Leading up to the primary, Senator D'Amato declared: "The flat tax will be devastating for New York," citing studies that pointed to a large drop in property values, especially on Long Island, due to the loss of state and local tax and mortgage interest deductions.  Governor George Pataki reportedly said that a Forbes-style flat tax would "destroy New York's economy."  Long Island Republican Congressman Peter King also railed against the flat tax.  Following their leaders, the pack of Republican anti-flat taxers in New York grew large.	
<P>
But the real reason New York politicos oppose a federal flat tax with few deductions was spelled out by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on the Sunday before New York's primary.  Giuliani bemoaned the fact that the elimination of deductions for state and local income and property taxes would hurt high-tax states and localities -- i.e., New York State and New York City -- and might even increase pressure to lower state and local tax rates.  Imagine the horror, New York politicians forced to lower tax rates!	New York elected officials like the fact that the current federal tax code subsidizes their own profligacy.  A system filled with loopholes also greases the wheels for deal-making and horse trading between New York's federal representatives and others from across the nation.  New York politicians have a clear stake in the current system.  However, New York taxpayers have a real stake in reforms that will cut their taxes and boost the economy.	
<P>
Under today's tax code, resources are drained away from productive private sector ventures and into largely unproductive government undertakings.  High tax rates create disincentives for working, saving, investing, and risk taking -- the true engines of economic growth and job creation.  Indeed, New York's burdensome tax structure has kept the state's rate of job growth well below the national average for at least the past two decades.  New Yorkers would benefit from a low flat tax in many ways: New Yorkers' tax rates would be cut significantly.  For example, under the Forbes plan, the top federal-state combined income tax rate in New York would fall from about 44 percent to 24 percent.  In New York City, the rate would decline from  more than 46 percent to about 28 percent.   Overall, according to the Heritage Foundation, the average household in New York would save $1,298 annually under a 17% flat tax. Under the current tax code, returns on investment are taxed at the corporate level and the individual level.  
<P>
As called for under the Forbes flat tax, double taxation of capital gains and dividends would come to an end, thereby boosting incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- both in short supply in New York.  More investment and risk taking translates into faster growth and more jobs.   The Forbes plan calls for an end to deductions for interest payments at the business level and no taxation of interest earned at the individual level.  The effect of these changes, increasing supply and lowering demand for loanable funds, combined with lower tax rates, would be to dramatically reduce interest rates.   Lower interest rates, increased incentives for saving and investment, and faster economic growth -- all resulting from the flat tax -- will more than offset any potential downward pressure on property values due to a loss of mortgage interest and property tax deductions.  
<P>
Indeed, one could legitimately expect a tremendous boost to New York's economy, and therefore to property values, under a flat tax. And finally, if a flat tax actually does pressure state and local officials to cut taxes, so much the better.  In high-tax New York, any means to reducing taxes is a net plus for the state's economy and the well-being of individuals, families, and businesses.	Former New York Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was so appalled by New York GOP machine attacks on the flat tax that he finally endorsed Steve Forbes for president.    Though Forbes soon dropped out of the race, Kemp's endorsement illustrated how principle and sound economics can rise above political pandering and special interests.	New York's economy would be helped, not hindered, by the flat tax.  And now that Forbes is out of the race, Senator Dole even has uttered a few niceties about the flat tax.  Unfortunately, with Senator D'Amato and New York's special interests at Dole's side, don't expect much movement toward a true, low flat tax in the near future.

The Shape of the Right in NY
<p></B>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating
<p><i>March 11, 1996</i>
<P><br></center>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote>
"If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (1 Corinthians, 14:8)	With a major victory over Mario Cuomo in 1994 and a state Democratic Party in continuing confusion, New York conservatives are understandably looking forward to November's battle for control of the State Assembly.  But are they up to the task?  Herewith, some analysis: The Conservative Party is running television ads for a Gingrich-style "Contract with New York."  The strategy is the same as it was for the national Republican Contract with America: unite all the candidates around popular policies, focusing the races on a larger vision, in this case, a statewide vision.  The vision thing always has been unfamiliar ground to the New York GOP, so conservatives must provide a clear map.	The Contract contains some excellent policy prescriptions: term limits, school vouchers, initiative and referendum, an end to affirmative action, etc.  It sets a standard for smaller government and more freedom.
<P>
	Though, from an artistic standpoint, the Contract's television ad doesn't score very high.  It features tax-dollars being flushed down a toilet.  Undoubtedly true, but a point crudely made. The Contract will serve, we hope, as a precedent.  An objective standard to which local Conservative Party chairmen can be held accountable.  Some local chairmen suffer from a curious ailment of endorsing liberal Democrats.  Just to note the most egregious cases, we've discovered four assembly Democrats endorsed by conservatives at the local level who scored at 50% or below when their voting records were ranked by the state Conservative Party -- Dov Hikind, 35%; Steven Kaufman, 45%; Ronald Tocci, 45%; and Paul Tokasz, 50%.	Democratic Congressman Mike McNulty, also endorsed by his local Conservative Party, had an American Conservative Union 1995 rating of just 21%!  
<P>
Following the laws of probability you can get a monkey to vote more conservative.  Indeed, one Republican operative we spoke with after a statewide race a few years ago, observed that some local conservative politicos were more enamored of patronage than even their GOP confreres. While the Contract might help bring these strays back into the fold, it is not devoid of problems either.	For example, the tax proposal calls for a "middle class tax cut."  Why middle-class taxes only?  Is class warfare so ingrained in the minds of average New Yorkers that even the Conservative Party has to soft-pedal its message?  It makes sense to cut taxes across the board, in order to spur investment, entrepreneurship and job creation.  To boost New York's economy, we need tax cuts that are deep and provide real relief for individuals of all income levels as well as businesses.
<p>	
There's also the issue of abortion. Not even a word about restrictions appears in the Contract.  New York Christian Coalition executive director Jeff Baran finds it curious: "Compared to the Conservative Party's platform planks, you don't see any social issues in the Contract with New York." Baran told C&K that since the election of George Pataki, he sees a real move toward economic issues and away from social issues among state conservatives, which leaves his members feeling out in the cold.  It remains hard to get them excited about green eyeshade stuff, no matter how true.	Baran has "taken a lot of heat," he says, from his own people for "broadening" his agenda to economic issues, while not seeing any action on the social issues front in return.  This is a microcosm of what's happening at the national level, where alienated evangelicals have flocked to the Buchanan campaign, with its dismal economic message. 
<P>
As for the state legislative races, how is the current crop of Republican assembly hopefuls you ask?  What crop?  The GOP is off to a very slow start finding good conservative candidates.  This worries Dusty Rhodes, of the conservative group Change-NY: "We can't work with the GOP to get something done in this state, in particular to ensure that taxes aren't increased, if they don't get the right candidates to work with."	As is the case nationally, on the brink of real victory, New York conservatives seem strangely in disarray.  They struggle to unite social and economic conservatives, where in the past this was never such a herculean task.

<h2>An E-Burst to Dow's Place </h2>
</B>
<P>
<B>By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos"> Michael Vlahos</a></B><BR>

<P>
<I><p>20 March, 2006.</I>
<p>

My cryptagent made the discovery.  It sure looked like a break-in:  the wreckage of 512bit crypto code, address shreds from bolted folders, a corrupted cache. I sure hope the CC boys found what they were looking for.
<P>
How did it happen that the Government now routinely reads what we write and say in the ether?  That sure wasn't the intention, back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed.  The idea then was that very restricted language would be inserted that would protect our children.  I even remember the scene at a certain Wednesday meeting:  The "Family" alliance was making a big stink about "smut on the internet," and when we barely whispered, "censorship," they got even angrier.<I>  "See this language," they </i>and their conference committee champions said,<i> "this does nothing to inhibit free speech.  We're just taking the Pacifica definition of obscenity that everyone agrees with.  And look!  We even put in a paragraph that tells the FCC it has no power to enforce any of this!"</i>
<P>
How could you argue with that, especially when that particular staffer's hands were shaking with righteousness?  We all had similar run-ins.  We didn't want to alienate our friends on the side of the angels, so we let it pass.
<P>
We forgot the great truth about government in the last century:  legislation to do good for all ends up as government's authority to control us.  The Income Tax, Prohibition, the Draft, Citizens with Disabilities, the Clean Air Act, the Tobacco Control Act of '02;  all were designed to help people, boost the general welfare, promote civic virtue.  
<P>
But they were designed to achieve all these good things by fiat from above.  Today, so many of us think these laws pure tyranny, but the laws themselves did not enslave us.  We need to look elsewhere for that, to the ethos of rule.
<P>
The late-lamented twentieth century saw the maturation and old age of an industrial world.  It was a world of pyramids run from the top down, where those who made it to the top were called "the best and the brightest."  Law and Ivy credentials gave them the authority to call themselves<i> managers </i> (the equestrian rank of those days).  But they were not content to use this authority merely to rule.  They wanted to<i> help</I> people;  and they knew,
<i>O best and brightest,</I> that they had the smarts and the heart to do it.
<P>
They were<i> Progressives.</I>  The whole of the last century was informed by the urgent need for smart people to uplift everyone else.  And only they knew how.  And only they could do it.
<P>
This ethos of rule naturally inclined toward laws that would let the best and brightest do their good work right away.  But to do this, progressives needed not just authority;  they needed control.  Their reasoning:  <i>People will never do right on their own:  just look at the chaos and abuse of an open system.  People have to be told what to do.  The more they do what we say, the better things will be.</I>       
<P>
No, this was not Stalin's kind of control.  Not exactly.
<P>
Even now it is hard for us to believe that people who called themselves <i>Liberal and Progressive </I>for so long longed only to bring us a kinder and gentler Gulag.  But look at what they have done:
<P>
It's true, the language in the Telecom Act of '96 was careful.  FCC enforcement of the censorship provision <i>(what else can I call it!)</I> was forbidden.  The problem was, it was there in the first place.  We failed because we were worrying about the wrong problem.
<P>
We worried about "porn on the internet;"  or we were vulnerable, in some celestial way, to entreaties for the welfare of our children.  So we let a bill pass that gave progressive government still more authority over our lives.  The "Family" alliance was thinking,<i> Save our Children!,</I> but someone else was thinking,<i> I can do the protecting!</I>    
<P>
We then gave the Fed the implicit charge to go out and protect us some more.  Not the FCC.  Oh no.  The law said they could not enforce.  But there were scads of Federal agencies aching to enforce.  And enforce they did.  If the FCC was barred from enforcement, it was not denied the right of assistance.  And assist they did.
<P>
And those NSA geeks (don't tell me it was just CC boys) busting into my cache?  I knew it would happen eventually.  My encryption engine exceeded the Federal legal rating  and it was in use.  Like the old radar detectors, we all have them;  they're only illegal if you use them.  And since they're too hard to crack in volume, we get by.  We need 512 bits, for plain old privacy.
<P>
So that was how the Telecom language intended to protect us become our scourge:  All porn has to be encrypted, but encryption that works is illegal to use!  Since the porn guys have been giving away 512b engines and keys for free, the Feds say this means most kids can get it<i> (if you ignore the '000s of parental control products!). </I> So our Protectors have their probable cause <i>and</I> their slogan:<i>  For the children!</I>
<P>
I just hope it took them a nice long time to break in.  I left them a nice <i>.gif </I>of Manet's <i>Olympia.</I>  Good thing I've got the latest 1024b kernel on my hand-held.  At least they haven't started search and seizure
<P>
Yet.

<blockquote>
Small business drives America's economy.  By 1996, 8 out of 10 jobs in America will be generated by small business.  Yet, too often the United States government ignores this reality and creates an environment hostile to small business creation.
                 <P>
Between 1989 and 1992, government regulations on small business increased over 34%.  By 1992, small businesses were burdened with nearly $130 billion more in costs in 1990.  Increased government regulations and higher taxes have added billions more in costs to small business operations.
     <P>
With great peril to the United States' competitiveness, legislators mandate costly, ineffectual, and punitive regulations that undermine individual freedom to control their own livelihood.  SBSC works to eliminate the burdensome and unnecessary tax and regulatory demands on small business.  Our goal is to amend current punitive policies to policies that preserve and enhance the entrepreneurial spirit.
        <P>
You can be certain that we always fight for principle; too much is at stake in America.

<h2>Conventions</h2>
</center><P>
In a sense, the national conventions are giant ads for the parties,
huge 4-day television spots.  Although they formerly served as
decision-making bodies, the party conventions have become more
like coronations.  Seeking to convey unity and harmony to the
television audience, party officials work to resolve or paper
over differences in advance of the convention.  The result is
a dearth of news.
<P>
<center><a href="convent.jpg"><img src="convent.gif" alt="Timeline" border="0"></a></center>
<P>
Despite their reduced role, conventions are not just meetings
of people with silly hats; they continue to fulfill a number of
important functions.  They provide a venue for party activists
from across the country to get reacquainted and do some networking.
 The diverse interest groups that make up a party's constituency
are represented, and each tries to get its individual message
out.  Fundraisers congregate at various receptions, luncheons,
and dinners.  Attracted by the presence of 15,000 media representatives
from across the country and around the world, other groups try
to grab a few seconds of air time or lines of print.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hosting a party convention provides a big economic boost to a
city, and there is spirited competition for the privilege.  The
Democratic National Committee announced its selection of Chicago
in August 1994; the convention will be held at the United Center
from August 26-29. Republicans announced their choice, San Diego,
in January 1995; their convention will unfold at the San Diego
Convention Center on August 12.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The money to put on the major party conventions comes largely
from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, paid for by the
checkoff on Federal income tax forms.  (In 1992 the Democratic
and Republican National Conventions each received $11.4 million
from the U.S. Treasury; these numbers will be adjusted for inflation
in 1996.)  In addition, host committees in each city work with
volunteers and businesses to see that a proper welcome is given
to delegates and media personnel.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the formalities of the convention is adoption of the party
platform.  In the months preceding the convention, the party conducts
a series of hearings at which various interest groups are given
the opportunity to express their views.  Then the platform is
drawn up.  As Theodore White observed in The Making of the President
1960, the final document is largely a rhetorical exercise.  White
wrote that, &quot;...in actual fact, all platforms are meaningless:
the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience
of the candidate the party chooses to lead it.&quot;  Nonetheless,
each campaign highlights the gross faults and glaring distortions
in the other party's platform.  In 1992 for example, the Clinton
campaign produced &quot;The 1992 Republican Platform: An Annotated
Version,&quot; while the Bush campaign came up with a &quot;Platform
Comparison--Faith in Individuals versus Faith in Government.&quot;
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A successful convention can provide a boost for the candidate
heading into the fall campaign (&quot;convention bounce&quot;),
while a divisive one can undermine morale in the field.

<h2>The fall campaign</h2>
</center>
<P>
In the final months of the campaign, there are certain orienting
landmarks--the Labor Day kick-off, September debate negotiations,
the debates themselves, and the grueling last-ditch effort as
the candidates strive for those few additional votes.  While the
candidates seem to be ricocheting around the country in no particular
pattern, the distribution of campaign resources is determined
by <b>electoral math</b>.  
<P>
<center><a href="fall.jpg"><img src="fall.gif" alt="Timeline" border="0"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As outlined in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, the
president is chosen not by direct popular vote, but by electors
from each state.  A state has a number of electors equal to its
number of congressmen and senators.  (The District of Columbia
also has three electors, bringing the total to 538.)  In most
states, the popular vote winner takes all the electors.  For example,
even if a candidate wins California by a margin of less than 1
percent, he will gain all of the state's 54 electors.  Thus the
campaigns' strategies revolve around winning states that will
add up to a minimum of 270 electoral votes.  Some are seen as
pretty sure bets, some are tightly contested &quot;play-hard&quot;
states, some are possibles, and some are essentially unwinnable.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The campaigns are not only targeting particular states, but they
are trying to reach particular people within those states.  A
general election campaign is a battle for the attention of a relatively
small audience.  The rule of thumb in presidential campaigns is
that about 40 percent of those who turn out will vote for the
Republican candidate no matter what and another 40 percent will
vote Democratic no matter what.  Major resources during the fall
campaign are devoted to reaching and swaying the remaining 20
percent of the electorate--persuadable swing voters.  
<P>
<ul>
<b>Group A  </b><br>      
<ul>Will vote for the candidate almost automatically.  </ul>  
<P>
<b>Group B</b><br>
<ul>Will not vote for the candidate no matter what.</ul>
<P>
<B>Group C</B>
<ul>Swing voters; can be persuaded.
</ul></ul><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politicians think of the electorate in terms of three groups.
 The first group will vote for their candidate almost automatically.
 The second group will not vote for their candidate no matter
what.  The third group are swing voters.  This model can also
be applied to races with many candidates; for example Group A
could be Perot, Bush, or Clinton backers.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To attract the persuadables, candidates generally move toward
the middle, toning down the more extreme elements of their messages
that they had used to appeal to party activists during the primaries.
 They may run television spots and concentrate media efforts in
media markets with large numbers of persuadable voters.  The ads
one sees in this time are designed primarily to influence people
who have not made up their minds.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extensive resources are devoted to persuadable voters, but the
candidate's base (Group A) must be mobilized as well.  Some supporters
may need a bit of a nudge to get them out to the polls.  By narrowcasting
specific parts of the candidate's message to constituency groups,
the campaign can energize these people.  Then, as Election Day
approaches, get-out-the-vote efforts gear up to produce a big
turnout.
<p>
In 1994 and 1995, there was much speculation that one or more
credible independent or third-party candidates might emerge to
challenge the Democratic and Republican nominees.  Among those
mentioned were Colin Powell, Bill Bradley, Jesse Jackson, Lowell
Weicker, and Ross Perot.  Libertarians were also optimistic that
the ongoing reexamination of government would give their candidate
a boost.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The presence of a credible alternative to the major party candidates
adds a degree of uncertainty to the race, causing people to reassess
their support and increasing the competition for swing voters.
 Regardless of the number of candidates, the goal of each campaign
remains the same: go after the undecideds and mobilize supporters.

<P>
<h2>What makes a president</h2>
</center>
<P>
A presidential election is a defining moment for the nation. 
At the outset, a dozen or so hopefuls may offer themselves to
the voters as leadership material.  Only one will emerge as each
party's nominee.  A unique set of qualities and traits, in tandem
with a fortuitous unfolding of events, allows a successful candidate
to make the leap from the crowd.
<P>
<b>Leadership</b><br>
<ul>
Leadership entails not only setting a direction but possessing
the skills to see to it that one's ideas are implemented.  In
The Prince, Machiavelli wrote, &quot;There is nothing so perilous
in its outcome nor uncertain in its success as the introduction
of a new order of things.&quot;  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing a president is a personal decision.  In general, our
assessments of a candidate's character figure prominently.  Is
the candidate independent, arrogant, flaky, courageous?  Character
questions go to a deep level, beyond ideology or positions on
issues.  For this reason, campaigns often seek to raise doubts
about an opponent's character.  (&quot;Do I trust this guy?&quot;
 &quot;Is he stable?&quot;)
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Deutsch, a public communication analyst in Northern Virginia,
states that a candidate must convey three attributes at the same
time.  Familiarity means we perceive the candidate is like us.
 Appeasement means we feel the candidate cares for us as individuals.
 Power means we see the candidate as being more than any one ordinary
person; he or she is somehow in control of events.  Applying these
simple criteria, one can get a good idea of how a candidate will
fare regardless of what the public opinion polls of the moment
are saying.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thinking back to 1992, for example, Bill Clinton probably fulfilled
the above criteria better than George Bush.  Bush was portrayed
as being somewhat out of touch with ordinary Americans; an example
was the widely reported incident of the supermarket scanner. 
As for appeasement, there are numerous stories of Clinton's ability
to listen to people and ask thoughtful questions.  In terms of
being more than an ordinary individual, during the course of his
bus tours Clinton met with thousands of people and gained a unique
understanding of the nation.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Ideology counts</b>
<P>
<ul>
An ideology provides a consistent framework for addressing the
broad spectrum of issues.  Some of the candidates have clearly
discernable ideologies or political philosophies, while others
rely more on polls and behave more as opportunists.  Ideology
may be more important during the primaries, when people are choosing
among a bevy of candidates, than in the general election when
leadership attributes are particularly important.
</ul><P>
<center><h3>Who wins?</h3></center>
<P>
There have been numerous instances of candidates who have been
built up prior to the campaign failing to do well (John Glenn
in 1984 or Gary Hart in 1988).  Other candidates are much admired
but fail to get through the primaries (Bruce Babbitt in 1988 or
Paul Tsongas in 1992).  Rather than referring to another mindless
poll, think about some of the factors at work:
<P>
<ul><li><b>Television</b> has elevated the importance of external appearances.
 Historically, a candidate's physical appearance may have made
some difference; for example it is recognized that taller candidates
may have an advantage.  In the television era, a candidate's <a href="images.html">ability
to perform well on the medium of television</a> is fundamental to
his or her political success.  The candidate must have no &quot;edges&quot;
that will jar viewers.  In 1992, for example, Bush often appeared
ill-at-ease, while Clinton moved around with the ease of a television
show host.
<P>
<li><a href="process.html"><b>The nominating process itself</b></a>, while designed to be neutral, does
favor certain types of candidates.  For example, some potentially
solid candidates are discouraged from running by fundraising demands.
 It is true that all the candidates must play by the same rules,
but one can see that different rules would produce different outcomes.
 A closely grouped succession of primaries requires that a candidate
run an expensive media campaign.  Caucuses, by contrast, tend
to favor candidates who can organize at the grassroots.  
<P>
<li><b>Incumbency</b> can be an advantage for the president both in terms
of symbolism and concrete actions.  An incumbent president has
an edge in conforming to one's internal image of a leader because
he is surrounded by the trappings of office.  He arrives on Air
Force I, he gets &quot;Hail to the Chief,&quot; and he speaks
from a lectern with the presidential seal on it.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The incumbent can also take steps during the campaign to &quot;buy&quot;
support.  For example, in 1992, at the beginning of September,
President Bush announced an increase in subsidies for wheat exports
and the sale of 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan.  These and
other actions caused Detroit News writer James Gannon to label
him &quot;a flying fountain of federal aid&quot; and the Washington
Post to compare him to &quot;a department store Santa Claus in
December.&quot;  Incumbency has a downside too.  After a party
has been in power for a number of years, it may grow complacent
or be afflicted by various scandals; people start thinking about
change.
<P>
<li><b><a href="context.html">The historical and economic context</b></a> in which an election campaign
is fought has an important effect on the outcome.  Had communism
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union not collapsed during the
Bush tenure, the dynamics of the 1992 campaign might have been
very different.  Coinciding with the end of the Soviet threat,
the Clinton-Gore ticket presented voters with the question of
whether they were ready for a younger generation of leadership.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The state of the economy is particularly significant.  Ray Fair,
a professor at Yale University, has even developed an equation
that &quot;explains votes for president [in the general election]
on the basis of economic conditions at the time of the election.&quot;
 Fair writes, &quot;The two economic variables that seem most
important are the growth rate of real per capita GNP in the six-month
period prior to the election and the rate of inflation in the
two-year period prior to the election.&quot;  In the 1992 campaign,
lackluster economic performance in Bush's term clearly undercut
his re-election bid.
<P>
<li>With the historical and economic context and the candidates set,
<b><a href="genl.html">a well-run campaign</a></b> can also make some difference in the outcome
of an election.  A good campaign organization sets the agenda
and the terms of debate.  The 1992 contest was not about foreign
policy--Bush's terrain--but revolved around the domestic economy,
as in, &quot;It's the economy, stupid.&quot;  Exactly how much
of an effect a campaign can have is a much-debated point, but
most observers agree that Bush's campaign was poorly managed,
while Clinton's team avoided the mistakes of past Democratic efforts.
<P>
<li>Finally, there is always the <b>element of chance</b>.  The best-laid
plans, the most careful positioning, and the soundest campaign
organization can all be knocked awry by an unexpected event.
</ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>Candidates</b>  
<ul>More than 150 candidates have registered with the
Federal Election Commission to run for president.  The pack of
presidential hopefuls presents a wide range of experience and
motivations.  Some have served in politics for more than thirty
years; others have never run for public office.  Some have a well-defined
political philosophy, others are more pragmatic, and still others
may be running to draw attention to a single issue.  Some are
able to raise tens of millions of dollars and build elaborate
campaign organizations, while others have put up a few thousand
dollars to run a campaign out of their own homes.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To actually appear on a ballot in a particular state, however,
a candidate must meet that state's criteria.  Ballot access rules
vary from state to state.  New York's rules were among the most
restrictive.  To fully compete in the New York Republican presidential
primary, a candidate had to obtain 1,250 signatures from each
of the state's 31 congressional districts (a few districts needed
less than 1,250).  In itself the task of getting 30,000 signatures
would be a straightforward proposition, but the party had arcane
rules that allowed petitions to be disqualified for the most minor
infractions.  By contrast, New Hampshire requires candidates to
file a declaration of candidacy &quot;not more than 74 nor less
than 60 days before the presidential primary&quot; and to pay
a fee of $1,000.  Candidates also need to provide information
on their delegates and alternates.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some individuals, whom the media have identified as &quot;presidential
material,&quot; survey the political landscape and decide not
to run, whether for family reasons, because they feel they do
not have the &quot;fire in the belly,&quot; or because they do
not feel they can meet fundraising demands.  These figures of
speculation often attract as much attention as declared candidates.
 Those who do decide to run announce their bids and set about
raising money and positioning themselves for the intense primary
period.</ul>
<P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="iowanh.html">Primaries and Caucuses.</a></b>  
<ul>While there are a range of political
parties to choose from, the two-party system is a solid feature
of American politics.  The Republican and Democratic parties,
by virtue of tradition and their vast resources, dominate the
presidential selection process.  From February to June, state
Republican and Democratic parties conduct primaries or caucuses
to select delegates to the national nominating conventions. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The series of presidential preference primaries and caucuses has
an almost circus-like air as the candidates race from state to
state trying to gain the attention of the media, pick up momentum
and win delegates.  Caucuses are a multi-step process for choosing
delegates that starts with meetings at the precinct level and
leads up to a state convention.  The caucus system is mostly confined
to smaller states and places a premium on grassroots organizing.
 In primaries, by contrast, the campaign has a media-intensive
orientation and delegates are distributed according to popular
vote.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caucuses formerly were the dominant method of selecting delegates,
but the primary has come into increasing favor over the past two-and-a-half
decades as the parties have sought to open up the process.  Turnout
in primaries tends to well below 50 percent of eligible voters.
Caucuses, because they are more time-consuming, attract only the
most active party members.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to vote in a party's preference primary or participate
in a caucus one must be a registered voter.  Frequently one must
also be registered as member of the party.  Registering to vote
is a simple procedure, although each state's rules vary somewhat.
 In general a person must fill out a form stating that he or she
is a United States citizen, is 18 years or older and has a permanent
home in the locality in which he or she wishes to vote.  Some
states require that a person choose a party; others do not.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chaotic primary system is uniquely American; in most other
countries the parties choose their leaders in a closed process.
 As Republicans and Democrats grab the media spotlight, smaller,
third parties are also choosing their nominees.  Finally, a candidate
can run as an independent, bypassing the party route altogether
and qualifying for the November ballot by petitioning to get on
the ballot.  While Ross Perot did this in 1992, tremendous resources
were needed to make it happen in all fifty states. 
</ul><P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="conv.html">Conventions</a></b>  
<ul>During two separate weeks in August, delegates gather
at the Republican and Democratic national conventions to choose
the parties' nominees.  Conventions formerly served as decision-making
bodies, but in recent decades the outcomes have been a foregone
conclusion.  The convention allows the party to present its ticket
to the national television audience and is in a sense a giant
ad for the party.  The convention also approves the party platform.
</ul><P>
<b><a href="elect.html">Election Day</a></b>
<ul>Fresh from the conventions, the Democratic and
Republican nominees enter the second phase of the election--the
fall campaign.  They are joined by third party and independent
candidates who, despite their best efforts, are generally marginalized.
 Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican candidates crisscross
the country focusing their resources on winnable states that will
enable them to reach the required 270 electoral votes.  The campaigns
each spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising campaigns.
 A series of high-stakes presidential and vice-presidential debates
and efforts to mobilize supporters (Get Out The Vote) lead up
to Election Day.  As provided for by Article II of the Constitution,
Congress has set Election Day as the first Tuesday following the
first Monday of November.
</ul><P>
<b>The Electoral College</b>  
<ul>One of the most misunderstood features
of American presidential elections is the Electoral College. 
The President is not selected by direct popular vote.  On Election
Day, when a voter chooses a particular candidate, he or she is
actually voting for that candidate's electors.  The Electoral
College system, although decried by many as an anachronism, is
prescribed by the Constitution.  Each state has a number of electors
equal to its number of Senators and Representatives and the District
of Columbia has three for a total of 538.  The electors meet about
a month after the election in the 50 state capitols.  In most
states they are bound to vote in a bloc for the popular vote winner.
 Only when the results of Electoral College voting are transmitted
to the President of the Senate and one of the candidates has achieved
a majority (270), does the outcome of the election become official.

<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A comparable situation would be if, in the election of a student
body president, each class had a number of representatives based
on its size--say one for every seven people.  The class would
vote, and the results would be tallied.  If Joe Smith won, all
of the class representatives or electors would be committed to
Smith.  They would meet a month later at the teacher's desk and
vote for Smith.  The results from each class would be then transmitted
to the Vice Principal's office and counted to determine the new
president.
</ul><P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="trans.html">Seal</a></b>  
<ul>Despite the Electoral College procedure, it is almost always
clear from the popular vote count who has won the election.  In
the transition period, the winning candidate, now the President-elect,
shifts from campaign mode to shaping the new administration. 
Elaborate festivities build up to Inauguration Day, which is set
by the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution on the 20th day
of January.  The swearing-in ceremony completes the transfer of
power and the new (or second-term) administration is underway.
 The election process is complete--except for the analyses which
will go on for several years more.  Those who are thinking about
running in the year 2000 start to engage in a few preliminary
musings!

<P>
<h2>Context</h2>
</center>
<P>
The historical context in which an election occurs is as important
as the qualities of the candidates and the rules of the nominating
process in determining its outcome.  In 1992 for example, the
end of the Cold War tilted the playing field away from George
Bush, the candidate with recognized foreign policy experience.

<P>
A number of factors will set the context for the 1996 campaign.
<ul>
<li>The <b>state of the economy</b> is always at the forefront in presidential
elections.  People vote their pocketbooks, and if the economy
is strong a plurality may well opt to re-elect President Clinton
regardless of any qualms they may have about his character.  
<P><li>The year-long debate over the Clinton health care plan and the
subsequent Republican surge in the 1994 midterm elections have
led to a thorough re-examination of <b>the proper role of the federal
government</b>, what some are terming &quot;the second American revolution.&quot;
 If not a revolution, the conservative advances certainly suggest
a major realignment.  The welfare state and programs instituted
by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s are undergoing thorough scrutiny.
<br>
<P><li><b>The 1994 elections</b> gave Republicans control of both the House
and Senate for the first time in 40 years.  After November 1994,
Republicans held thirty governorships, including eight of the
nine biggest states (only Florida withstood the tide) and the
key Mideastern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.  From
a narrow political point of view, the Republican wins have expanded
the friendly territory available to the Republican presidential
nominee during the fall campaign.  
<br>
<P><li>The <b>discontent</b> that first emerged in the electorate during the
1990 elections does not appear to be dissipating as a result of
the activities of the Republican Congress.  Inaction on matters
such as term limits and campaign finance reform and underlying
uncertainties about economic security may remain.  Voter frustration
could turn against the Republican Congress, be channeled into
a third party or independent presidential candidacy, spark renewed
local activism, or manifest itself in ways as yet unseen.
<P><li>Surface political currents should not obscure some of the <b>deeper
issues</b> facing society.  Widely differing perceptions of the O.
J. Simpson trial and the October 1995 Million Man March on Washington
showed that substantial work remains to be done to improve race
relations in this country.  Others have expressed more general
concerns about community.  In a much-discussed article &quot;Bowling
Alone,&quot; Robert Putnam drew attention to decreasing levels
of individual participation and involvement. 

<P><li>Half a dozen years into the post-Cold War era, <b>foreign
policy and national security issues</b> appear to have lessened in
importance.  Unrest in Bosnia, China, and some of the states of
the former Soviet Union could again move these concerns to the
fore.  And, in an increasingly interconnected world, less conventional
threats including terrorism, man-made mishaps, and global environmental
problems cannot be ignored.
<P><li>America finds itself in the midst of the <b>Information Revolution</b>.
 E-mail allows us to stay in touch with family and friends and
the World Wide Web provides instant access to material on everything
from phylogenetics to political candidates.  Yet while we are
connected to all this information, there is at times a sense of
disconnection.  More than fifty years after the end of World War
II, heading into a new millennium, many voters believe it's time
to overhaul some of the institutions and ways of doing things
that have evolved in these past decades.  In this context, then,
the candidates will offer their prescriptions and the 1996 campaign
will unfold.

<h2>Pre-primary period</h2>
</center>

<P>
In a sense, following developments in the pre-primary period is
like watching athletes do their warm-up exercises before a race.
 There is a lot of speculation, and one can make some useful observations,
but there is no telling what will happen when the candidates face
real voters.
<P>
The 1992 campaign did not get fully underway until September 1991
because President Bush's popularity after the Gulf War deterred
most Democrats from making a move.  For 1996 the situation is
quite different.  President Clinton's perceived weakness and the
frontloading of the primary schedule prompted many Republican
candidates to start their activities within a few months of the
1994 mid-term elections.  Republican challengers will have had
about half a year longer to build their organizations, raise money,
and hone their messages than did their Democratic counterparts
in 1992.  
<P>
<center><a href="preprim1.jpg"><img src="preprim1.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
The first step in launching a presidential bid is &quot;testing
the waters.&quot;  The potential candidate talks with friends
and colleagues, seeks advice from a number of sources, makes some
thoughtful speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, and gauges the
reaction.  He or she weighs current responsibilities and the prospects
of success (winning the nomination or shaping the debate) against
the toll a campaign will take on his or her personal life.  At
this point some decide to bow out.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those who decide to proceed and want to start <a href="financ.html">raising and
spending money</a>, the next step is to establish an exploratory committee
or file a statement of candidacy.  During this time, the candidate
will have a detailed plan drawn up that outlines his or her strengths,
weaknesses, and strategy.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The announcement speech or announcement tour is one of the most
symbolic events of the campaign.  In a carefully selected location
before a carefully prepared backdrop, helped along by crowds of
cheering supporters, the candidate launches his or her quest.
 Announcement speeches are typically replete with references to
family, God, and country.  The candidate presents his or her vision
of the country's problems and its future.  Oftentimes footage
shot at the announcement speech will appear in campaign videos
or ads.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next six months to a year, the candidates are out making
the rounds at various party gatherings, seeking support from activists,
holding fundraising events, and working to generate favorable
media coverage.  Aside from activists and political reporters,
however, most people are paying scant attention. 
<P>
<center><a href="preprim2.jpg"><img src="preprim2.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
The major challenge candidates face in the pre-primary period
is to establish <B>credibility</B>.  The three main ingredients
to credibility are stature, money, and campaign organization.
<P>
<blockquote>
<b>Stature</b>
<ul>Candidates without previous service in high elective
office have generally not been selected as nominees by the major
parties.  For the most part, successful Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates have come out of governors' offices or
the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives.  Candidates from
outside the political domain are rare; Eisenhower was a notable
exception. Lack of political experience often counts as an automatic
first strike against a candidate.  In fact, however, it is not
so much experience, but stature that counts.  A candidate who
repeatedly delivers substantial, well-received speeches will garner
favorable reviews and gain the support of party activists looking
to find someone who is &quot;presidential material.&quot; 
</ul>
  
<P>
<a href="financ.html"><b>Money</b></a>
<ul>Fundraising is sometimes referred to as the first
primary.  Money will be particularly important in the 1996 campaign
because of the compressed primary schedule.  Early on, Senator
Phil Gramm set the stakes by spreading the word that he would
raise $20 to $30 million before the first contest, the Iowa caucuses.
 Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander vowed to match Gramm.  Raising more
than $70,000 a day requires a lot of $1,000-a-plate dinners. 
Contributors are essentially investing in what is an untested
commodity, for there is no telling how well the candidates will
do when they face the voters.  Fundraising demands have discouraged
a number of well-qualified presidential prospects from running.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Campaign organization</b>
<ul>The battle for talent, in which
candidates seek to attract big-name media consultants, fundraisers
and pollsters to their campaigns, starts even before the announcement
speeches.  After building the core, candidates work to line up
endorsements from elected officials and party activists in key
primary states.  Meanwhile, their organizations generate shows
of support at myriad party gatherings and straw polls.  (Straw
polls are votes put on by state party organizations that have
no effect on the selection of delegates and are basically exercises
in hype.)  While the candidates circulate at the &quot;cattle
shows,&quot; their campaign organizations play up positive news
stories and attempt to douse negative ones. 
</ul>
</blockquote>
<P>
In its early stages, a candidacy can be compared to the tender
shoot of a sprouting seed; a spate of negative publicity can cripple
it and small problems may be indicative of difficulties to come.
 The successful candidate must demonstrate stature, fundraising
strength and organizational ability in the pre-primary period.
 Based on these three factors, the media determine that some candidates
are &quot;credible&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; and have a chance
winning the nomination.  The rest are classified as second or
third tier candidates, although not a single vote has been cast.

<B><a href="http://www.cityvote.org">CityVote</a></B>.  The nonprofit CityVote organized a &quot;national
urban presidential primary,&quot; held on November 7, 1995 in
about 20 cities across the country in conjunction with local elections.
 CityVote sought to focus attention on the problems of America's
cities.  Its &quot;primary&quot; was not part of the nominating
process and had no impact on the selection of delegates.  Nonetheless
as a national event, occurring three months before the Iowa and
New Hampshire contests, it did draw some attention.  CityVote
had also planned four nationally televised candidate debates for
October and early November, but the &quot;major&quot; candidates
declined to participate.

<h2>Iowa and New Hampshire</h2>
</center>
<P>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary offer presidential
candidates an opportunity to engage in retail politics and to
refine their messages before moving to a more media intensive
mode later in the campaign.  
<p>

<center><a href="iowanh.jpg"><img src="iowanh.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iowa and New Hampshire zealously guard their first-in-the nation
status.  Indeed, Iowa law requires that the Iowa caucuses be held
eight days before any other state's delegate selection process.
 When Delaware Republicans sought to move their 1996 primary to
within four days of the New Hampshire primary, New Hampshirites
took severe umbrage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iowa and New Hampshire are not typical states.  Iowa has about
1.7 million registered voters, but only a few hundred thousand
turn out at the Republican and Democratic precinct caucuses. New
Hampshire, with a population of just 1.1 million, is one of the
most Republican, whitest and wealthiest states in the nation.
 Iowa's and New Hampshire's importance in 1996 will be greater
than ever because of the compressed primary schedule.  Carl Cameron,
WMUR-TV's (Manchester, NH) political reporter, says that his state
will act as &quot;a sprinter's starting block.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the candidates seek from Iowa and New Hampshire is momentum.
 In 1976, Iowa gave Jimmy Carter a boost.  As for New Hampshire,
since 1952 no man--except Bill Clinton--has won the presidency
without first winning the state's primary.  In 1992 Clinton came
in second to Paul Tsongas with 25 percent of the vote, but was
able to claim a measure of victory as &quot;the comeback kid.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One cannot discuss the New Hampshire primary without mention of
the state's two biggest media outlets.  <a href="http://www.wmur.com">WMUR-TV Channel 9</a>, an
ABC affiliate, and the Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News
wield tremendous influence.  WMUR-TV's weekday newscasts reach
over 290,000 adults each weekday.  The candidates go to great
lengths to get coverage from the station which has a national
reputation for its coverage of politics.  The Union Leader, with
a daily circulation of 70,013 and a daily adult readership of
189,000, has broken many candidates over the years and for utra-conservatives
the paper's endorsement is a crown jewel. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the first contests, Iowa and New Hampshire receive a disproportionate
amount of news coverage from the national and international media.
 William C. Adams, a professor at George Washington University,
put together a map for the 1984 campaign showing the sizes of
the states in proportion to the amount of campaign coverage they
received.  New Hampshire, with a 1984 voting age population of
just 722,000, was as big as the 19 westernmost states including
California and Texas, states with a voting-age population in the
tens of millions.  1996 should follow the 1984 pattern.

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iowa and New Hampshire first-in-the-nation tradition is now
well established, but it does raise questions of fairness.  These
two states with such small populations have a huge influence in
the nominating process, while millions of voters in later contests
sometimes find that the nominees have essentially been selected.

<h2>The rest of the primaries</h2>
<small><a href="#dates">1996 Republican Primary Dates</a></small>
</center>
<P>
In the past, party elites controlled blocks of delegates and brokered
conventions determined the party nominees.  In 1960, for example,
John Kennedy competed in primaries in just two states -- Wisconsin
and West Virginia.  Following the tumultuous 1968 Democratic Convention,
however, the Democratic party instituted reforms designed to ensure
full participation and a fair reflection of presidential preferences.
 In many instances, Republican rules were changed by default as
the Democratic reforms were written into state election codes.
 As a result of the changes, presidential preference primaries
have proliferated as the major way of selecting delegates to the
national conventions.
<P>
<center><a href="primarie.jpg"><img src="primarie.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today the road to the nomination is a candidate-centered, <a href="images.html">media-driven
affair</a> that at times resembles a traveling circus.  Flinging the
candidates hither and yon across the country, the primary system
allows time for only the shallowest of campaigns in some states
(thereby requiring expensive media campaigns), and it leaves millions
of voters in late primaries with little say in the selection of
the nominees.  The 1996 primary season promises to be one of the
most frenetic ever.  Many states have moved the dates of their
primaries forward in an effort to have a greater say in the nominating
process.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conventional wisdom suggests that the frontloaded, compressed
schedule could produce a Republican nominee by the end of March,
as 70 percent of the delegates will have been chosen by then.
 More remote scenarios postulate that none of the candidates will
achieve a majority of the delegates and the matter will have to
be decided at the convention.  Meanwhile, the Democratic primaries
are expected to be a mere formality.
<p>
Although this year's primaries will unfold so rapidly as to appear
a blur, there are certain highlights to look for and moments when
the momentum can shift.  States in some parts of the country have
scheduled their primaries on the same day, creating mini-regional
primaries: the March 5 Yankee primary, the March 12 Southern primary,
and the March 19 Rust Belt primary.  The Republican March 26 California
winner-take-all primary is an entity unto itself.  Finally, if
one of the candidates does wrap up the Republican nomination early,
the three or four months leading up to the convention will be
a pivotal period.
<P>
As chaotic as the primary season appears, there are rules.  At
the national level, the parties set broad rules that they hope
will result in a nominee who can win in November.  Within the
framework of the national rules and requirements of state election
codes, each state party sets its own rules for qualifying delegates
to the national conventions.  Meeting all the different states'
filing requirements poses a significant challenge to the campaigns.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republican rules for selecting delegates differ from those of
the Democrats in several important respects.  The Democratic party
has adopted an elaborate set of national rules, while Republican
rules allow the state parties more latitude in how they select
their delegates.  In a number of states such as California, Republicans
still use the winner-take-all system, a vestige of the old structure.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dominant method for selecting delegates is the primary.  Closed
primaries are restricted to registered party members.  In an open
primary, any registered voter can vote, so that members of one
party may try to influence the outcome of the other party's primary.
 In nonbinding, or beauty contest primaries, the delegates are
selected by other means. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caucuses are a multistage process that starts in precinct or district
meetings and concludes with a state convention.  Caucuses require
more active involvement than do primaries.  Participants cannot
just take a quick trip to the polling booth; rather they must
be willing sit to through one or more meetings.  Candidates who
can effectively organize grassroots support often do well in caucuses,
but the system is used primarily in smaller states.
<P>
Turnout in presidential primaries is generally low.  The Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
research organization based in Washington, found that in 1992
only 33,637,075 of 171,003,000 eligible Americans voted in the
presidential primaries, a 19.6 percent turnout.
<P>
The American system for choosing the party nominees is uniquely
convoluted.  Starting in the bleak winter landscapes of Iowa or
New Hampshire, candidates must put themselves through a grueling
four-month series of state primaries and caucuses.  The process
tests the candidates in many ways, including their ability to
raise money, deliver the same speech countless times, and look
good on television.  For those potential leaders not willing to
put themselves through these trials, there remains the option
of waging independent or third-party campaigns in the fall. However,
the Democratic and Republican nominations remain the surest path
to the White House.

<h2>Debates</h2>
<small><a href="#points">Points to consider when watching a debate</a></small>
</center>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest event of the fall campaign is the series of
nationally televised presidential debates.  These first occurred
between Nixon and Kennedy in 1960, and they have been regular
fixtures since the Ford-Carter exchanges in 1976.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While there is no requirement that the presidential candidates
meet, debates in the fall are almost inevitable because it will
likely harm a candidate if he or she is seen to be blocking them.
 The campaigns have the final word when it comes to the debates.
 Much posturing and intense negotiations take place as each campaign
strives to achieve the most favorable format and schedule.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the campaigns set the terms, there are other interested
parties.  First, there is the public.  How meaningful the debates
will be depends heavily on the rules arrived at through the campaigns'
negotiations.  A debate can reveal the candidates' positions and
their differences, or it can devolve into a scripted exercise
bordering on &quot;a joint press conference.&quot;  In 1992 the
Bush and Clinton camps agreed to allow Ross Perot to participate
in the debates, but the Libertarian candidate, who had qualified
for the ballot in all fifty states, was excluded.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), established
in 1987, has emerged as the organizer of general election debates.
 The Commission is co-chaired by former heads of the Democratic
and Republican parties and is thus open to criticism.  Former
Rep. Tim Penny described it as &quot;a creature of the two major
parties.&quot;  In addition to the CPD, the networks and the League
of Women Voters have put forth credible debate proposals in recent
presidential elections.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any event, the debates are high-stakes events.  Voters who
have not yet made up their minds can be won and lost depending
on what transpires.  The drama of direct confrontation attracts
an immense television audience.  In 1992, viewership for the three
presidential debates ranged from 85-97 million, and the vice-presidential
debate attracted 74 million viewers.

 <H3>Points to consider when watching a debate:</H3>
<P>
<ul><li>First, listen to the moderator explaining the format at
the outset of the debate.
<P>
<li>Who is the debate sponsor?
<P>
<li>Who is on the stage and who isn't; what criteria were used
to select participating candidates?
<P>
<li>Who asks the questions?  Is there a single moderator or
a panel?  Are the questioners network anchors, more obscure journalists,
non-journalists or even members of the audience?
<P>
<li>Is there a live audience and, if so, who is in it?  A live
audience and interruptions for applause can significantly change
the tempo of a debate.
<P>
<li>Is the subject matter confined to one area such as the economy,
or is it less focussed?
<P>
<li>What is the time limit, if any, on candidate responses and
rebuttals?  From one to two minutes is common.
<P>
<li>Is the set unobtrusive or does it distract?  What camera
angles are used and what are the most frequent shots?
<P>
<li>At the end of the debate, before the commentators tell you
what happened, write down your impressions.  What in your view
were the key moments and why were they important?  
<P>
<li>Finally, see how the media cover the debate, both in immediate
post-debate commentary and later in broadcast and print news.
 Frequent aspects of coverage are &quot;who won&quot; discussions
and reactions from voters.

<h2>Election Day</h2>
</center>
<P>
On November 5, 1996, an election campaign that has been underway
for almost two years draws to a close.  The candidates, exhausted
by last-ditch efforts to rally up votes, are among the approximately
100 million citizens turning out at polling places across the
country.  
<P>
Also on the ground are thousands of interviewers surveying a sample
of the voters who have just cast their ballots.  Exit poll results
are a major feature of election night coverage.  They provide
a window on the concerns of voters as well as useful information
on gender, race, age, and other variations in voting behavior.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Controversy has arisen over the networks' use of exit polls to
project winners before the polls close.  Critics argue that early
projections of winners discourage voters from turning out.  In
1985 the networks pledged to Congress that they would refrain
from declaring winners in a state until the polls in that state
closed.  As a result, a less-than-adequate situation exists where
reporters have information but are bound not to relate it.  By
midafternoon on November 3, 1992, exit poll data showed that Clinton
had won big in the Electoral College.  NBC President Michael Gartner
observed in a post-election <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article that,
&quot;Everybody knew who the winner was but the people.&quot;
 
<P>
Election night is a major production for the networks' news divisions.
 Often they will construct a special set dominated by a big electoral
map and filled with lots of monitors.  The anchor and his in-studio
team analyze and relate the results, while other correspondents
report from the candidates' headquarters and from tightly contested
races around the country.  The evening draws to a close with concession
and victory speeches.

<h2>The transition period</h2>
</center><P>
As is taught in high school government classes, the president of the United States is not selected by direct popular vote, but by intermediaries known as electors.  The electoral system is outlined in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1804, which significantly modified original provisions contained in Article II.  All told there are 538 electors.  The manner of selection of electors varies, but they are generally chosen by congressional district.  Each party presents a slate of electors, usually people with longstanding party ties.  In all states, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, the winner of the popular vote takes all the electors.
<P>
<center><a href="trans.jpg"><img src="trans.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The formal process of making the election official begins when governors in each state issue certificates of ascertainment which confirm the results and electors.  Then, on December 16, 1996, (the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December), electors will meet in each state capitol.  They will vote first for president and then for vice-president, and the vote will probably be unanimous.  Certificates of vote from each state are then sent to the United States Senate, where they are officially opened, counted, and ratified in early January.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that none of the candidates has a clear majority, the election goes into the House of Representatives.  This has only happened twice, most recently in 1824, although there was talk in June 1992 that a good showing by Ross Perot might throw the election into the House.  A second problem with the electoral system is that the popular vote winner can actually lose the election as a result of electoral math.  This last happened in the Hayes-Tilden contest of 1876.
<br>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the Electoral College system is denounced as an archaic and anachronistic holdover, to abolish it outright would require a constitutional amendment.  President Carter pushed to introduce direct popular vote during his administration and Ross Perot argued for direct popular vote in 1992; some states have also considered replacing their winner-take-all rules with the split-vote system.  However, until the Electoral College produces another untoward outcome, there is unlikely to be any sustained move to change it.
 <P>
Beyond the Electoral College formalities, what happens in the transition period obviously depends upon whether President Clinton is re-elected or not.  Should Clinton gain a second term, one may see actions designed to convey a sense of renewed activity.  Possibilities might be a Cabinet re-shuffle or a mega-event comparable to his 1992 Economic Conference.  Planning and preparations for the inaugural will begin.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should President Clinton be defeated, the new president-elect and his team must make effective use of the roughly seventy-five days until the inauguration.  Expectations are high.  The one-time candidate must assume a "presidential" aura, and, amid euphoria and exhaustion, responsibility looms.  Charles Jones, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, says that the campaign revolves around one person, the candidate; afterwards the challenge is "attaching that person to the government."  The president-elect and the transition team make crucial decisions about personnel, policy and logistics.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A certain amount of tension in this period is inevitable.  People who have worked hard on the campaign now see others being brought in to manage the transition.  There is much jockeying for position, and resumes proliferate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the business of creating or re-forming an administration proceeds, preparations for the ceremonial side of the transfer of power are underway.  Inaugurals are exercises rich in symbolism.  From a practical standpoint, the Inaugural Committee also can be a good place to put some of the former campaign people.  Several days of inaugural festivities lead up to noon on January 20, 1997, when the oath of office will be administered.

<h2>Images</h2>
</center>
<P>
Modern politics revolves around good visuals.  On many days, fleeting
images on television or a quick glance at the front page of the
newspaper may be all the information we get about the campaign.
 A candidate who holds up a chart or chooses a symbolic setting
to deliver a speech stands a better chance of catching the media's
attention--and yours.  While style alone cannot sell a message
lacking in substance, it can significantly boost a message's effectiveness.
<P>
If you go to a campaign event in person, your impressions of that
event may bear little connection to the mediated reality presented
in the nightly news or in the next day's newspaper.  Factors such
as camera work, editing, and the context in which the images appear
all combine to create a new reality.  Hans Kepplinger, an academic,
has in the past few years devised a &quot;model of presentation
impacts&quot; which provides a useful tool for understanding and
analyzing mediated images.  Kepplinger argues that as a viewer
is exposed to footage of a politician over time he or she will
develop an &quot;optically induced stereotype&quot; of the figure.

<P>
<h2>Language</h2>
</center>
<P>
A campaign generates a plentitude of words.  While there is a
fair degree of overblown rhetoric, obfuscation, and partisan sniping,
occasionally one of the candidates delivers a finely crafted speech
with a beginning, middle, and end.  In his recent book The Inarticulate
Society, Tom Shachtman argues that there is a &quot;crisis in
eloquence.&quot;  Politicians' concern with getting their soundbites
in the news may be one of the factors contributing to this decline.
<P>
The use of language in labeling merits some attention.  Labeling
people and subjects helps us to get a fix on them.  While some
labels such as &quot;former governor&quot; are harmless, others
such as &quot;pro-life&quot;/&quot;anti-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot;/&quot;pro-abortion&quot;
are ideologically charged.  
<P>
In a press release, bombast can sometimes be amusing.  For example,
one of the National Rainbow Coalition's JaxFaxes refers to Senator
Dole as &quot;Consummate Washington insider, deal-maker, cynic,
affirmative action race-baiter and leading Republican presidential
candidate Sen. Robert Dole (R-KS).&quot;  A weekly sheet put out
by the Dole campaign describes Lamar Alexander thusly: &quot;Lamar
Alexander, a former Southern Governor like Bill Clinton&quot;
<P>
Reporters, seeking to be objective and fair, must be careful not
to pick up this kind of charged language.  Sometimes the biases
carried by different words can be more subtle.  For example, Jesse
Jackson argues that when speaking of affirmative action debate,
&quot;quotas&quot; and &quot;preferences&quot; are incorrect;
affirmative action is, he says, about &quot;goals, targets, and
timetables.&quot;

<h2>Statistics</h2>
</center>
<P>
In an election year the latest numbers on unemployment, inflation,
factory orders, housing starts, etc. are often hyped/downplayed
as evidence of the success/failure of government programs and
policies.  It seems as if a politician can find a statistic to
support just about any viewpoint, and for that viewpoint there
will also be a set of statistics that directly contradicts it.
 
<P>
Dr. David Murray, research director of the nonprofit, nonpartisan
Statistical Assessment Service (STATS), argues that some numbers
are better than others.  Data arising from studies that do not
follow accepted procedures and methodology should be discounted.
 An estimate is an educated guess and much depends on the assumptions
made.  Estimates can be derived from a close study of existing
data or they may be off-the-cuff flights of fancy.   
<P>
Statistics can be twisted in ways big and small.  STATS literature
observes that, &quot;Advocacy groups regularly use the media to
pollute the policy debate with misleading or invented statistics
about purported social and economic problems.&quot;  Bad numbers
are a serious problem in public policy debates as they generate
much confusion.
<P>
One must pay close attention not only to the source of the numbers,
but also to the definitions used.  For example, an article may
cite numbers of &quot;missing and abused children,&quot; &quot;missing
children,&quot; or &quot;children abducted by strangers.&quot;
 The difference between these groupings can range from more than
a million to less than a thousand.  Murray states that every statistic
is an answer to a question; the trick is to identify the right
question.  The bottom line with numbers is to look carefully at
the labels that go with them and then to consider the underlying
argument they are being used to make.

<P>
<h2>Cutting Through the Blizzard of Messages</h2>
</center>
<P>
This is a checklist of questions to ask yourself to better get to the root of the numerous statements you will hear during the upcoming elections.
<ul>
<h3>What is the ultimate source of the information?</h3>  
<ul>
A candidate.
<br>Someone in or affiliated with one of the campaigns.
<br> An expert, a think tank, or government statistics.
<br> An interest group.
<br> An ordinary citizen or voter expressing an opinion.
<P></ul>
<h3>Is the source credible and the information believable and
complete?</h3>
<ul> Clearly, when considering information from a partisan source,
one must be  careful.<br>
 The facts cited may be true, but present only part of the picture.
</ul><P>
<h3>Is this information relevant?</h3>
<ul>
 A lot of charges fly hither and yon during a political campaign.
 One needs  to ask not only if a specific charge is true, but
also whether it affects a  candidate's capacity to set a direction,
implement policies, respond to  difficult situations, and be an
effective leader.
</ul><P>
<h3>What are other, opposing sources saying about the subject?</h3>
<ul>
 Seeking out three or four different points of view is a good
way to clarify  one's own thinking on an issue.
</ul>
<h3>Is there some aspect of the debate that is not being represented?</h3>
<ul>
 The campaigns may not be addressing some of the more difficult
issues, and  the media do occasionally suffer from blind spots.
</ul>
<h3>What do I think?</h3>
<ul>
 Difficult problems usually do not lend themselves to quick solutions.
 Each  of the approaches put forth may have some merit.  Which
do you think is  best, and why? 
</ul></ul>

<html><head><title>VOTE AMERICA:  Watching Campaign Ads</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="tile.gif">
<blockquote>
<center>
<a href="http://www.virtent.com"><img src="votelogo.gif" border="0"></a>
<P>
<h2>Watching Campaign Ads</h2>
</center>
<P>
The campaigns spend vast sums to develop, produce, and air television
spots.  In the 1992 general election, about two-thirds of the
Bush and Clinton campaigns' funds went into advertising.  All
told, the Bush, Clinton, and Perot campaigns spent a total of
$133 million on television advertising in the fall.  Television
ads offer very highly refined versions of a campaign's messages--in
a sense they are &quot;pure&quot; message--and as such they merit
close attention. 
<P>
For television ads to be effective they must <B>fit within a broad
communication strategy</B> so that the same message is being presented
by the different parts of the campaign.  In an era of rampant
channel surfing, good political ads <B>stand out from the clutter
of commercial advertising and programming</B>.  Their <B>technical
quality</B> must be such that viewers are not paying attention
to poor lighting or sound, but to the message.  They must be <B>believable</B>.
 Devices used to achieve credibility include news clips, documented
statistics, endorsements, testimonials by ordinary citizens, and
the use of formal office settings.  And, very importantly, a good
ad <B>strikes &quot;a responsive chord;&quot;</B> it causes the
viewer to smile or tap his foot.
<P>
Consultants can make use of many different types of images in
putting together a campaign ad.  If the candidate performs well
on camera, he or she may be prominently featured.  Other ads use
stock footage and still photos of children in classrooms, people
at work, and so forth.  Clips of the candidate's opponent are
central to many attack ads.  Viewers draw meaning from the surroundings
the candidate is in, the people he or she is interacting with,
and the types of clothes he or she is wearing.  However, pictures
alone do not make a good ad.  Producers of political ads are skilled
at using all of the <B>aesthetic fields</B>--light and color,
space, time and motion, and sound to create and enhance moods.
   
<P>
It is easy to denounce 30-second spots as &quot;soap bubbles&quot;
or &quot;dirt&quot; that reduce the level of debate and manipulate
viewers' emotions.  It can also be argued that they distract us
from the real issues.  The principal problem with advertising
is not the blatantly wrong or false ad, but the many ads that
shade the truth.  Advertisements often attack a candidate on one
or two specific points, devaluing the sum of his or her record.
 While consultants argue that negative ads &quot;make democracy
work&quot; by educating people about the candidates, attacks may
also contribute to a cynical electorate.  Finally, complex problems
simply cannot be discussed in 30 seconds.
<P>
<ul>
<li>When you see or hear an ad consider what sort of appeal
it is making (logical, emotional, ethical, fear), what its purpose
is (bio, define the opponent, respond to an attack and launch
a counterattack), and whether it is fair.   
<P>
<li>If you come across an ad that is not fair or bends the truth,
respond.  Let the campaign and the station that airs it know exactly
what the fault is.
<P>
<li>Look in newspapers and news programming for ad watches,
in which reporters present and analyze the campaigns' ads. 
<P>
<li>Play theater critic.  Has the consultant made good use of
the aesthetic fields--light and color, space, time and motion,
and sound?  Is the ad effective?  Why or why not?
<P>
<li>Think about what program the ad is airing on and what audience
the campaign is trying to reach. 
<P>
<li>Keep track of the spots the candidate has been running in
the course of the campaign and try to discern major themes. 
</ul>

<h2>Be a better news consumer</h2>
</center>
<P>
Careful regard to one's news and information sources is more important
than the actual quantity of news one takes in.  Catching the 6:00
news or reading the newspaper doesn't always result in a complete
understanding of the issues. 
<P>
Even if you do not read the newspaper daily, there are steps you
can take to better assess the information that is out there.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Look beyond familiar news sources and consider how other
news organizations are covering the campaign.
<P>
<li>Think about whether your newspaper or news sources devote
well-defined and organized space/time to the campaign or whether
their focus could be improved.
<P>
<li>Pay attention to the sources used in news stories: is the
information coming from someone affiliated with one of the campaigns,
an interest group, an expert, a voter?
<P>
<li>The media provide versions of the truth.  There may be aspects
of an event or situation that are not being reported on at all,
or that are not being covered sufficiently.
<P>
<li>If you think your preferred media outlets can do better,
contact them and let them know specific ways in which you think
their coverage can be improved. (Is their coverage disorganized?
 Are they running to many horse race polls?)  In general, news
organizations are happy to find out that people are paying attention,
provided the input is well thought out.

<h2>Follow the Money</h2>
</center>
<P>
In April 1995, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story on
Republican presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander with the headline
&quot;To Run for President, He Needs to Raise $77,000 a Day.&quot;
 Sen. Phil Gramm, another leading Republican candidate, says he
has the &quot;the most reliable friend that you can have in American
politics, and that's ready money.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given all the attention to fundraising in the lead-up to the primaries,
one might get the impression that money, rather than sound ideas,
is what makes a credible candidate.  The role of money in politics
has long been problematic, not just here in the United States,
but in democracies around the world.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system of presidential campaign finance in effect in the U.S.,
while not without its imperfections, is relatively simple in its
broad outlines.  During the primaries, partial public financing
provides qualifying candidates with matching funds from the U.S.
Treasury.  In the general election, candidates who agree to forgo
private money are fully funded.  The parties are also granted
money to put on their national conventions.  The money for these
payments comes from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, which
is filled by the $3 check-off on individuals' federal income tax
forms and administered by the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
and the U.S. Treasury Department. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate, Congress created the FEC
and established the current system of financing presidential elections,
including contribution limits, spending limits, disclosure requirements,
and public financing.  Public financing was introduced to address
several concerns:
<P><ul>
<li>The disproportionate influence (or the appearance of influence)
of wealthy contributors;
<P>
<li>The demands of fundraising that prevented some candidates
from adequately presenting their views to the public; and
<P>
<li>The increasing cost of presidential campaigns that effectively
disqualified candidates who did not have access to large sums
of money.
<br>
<small>Source: FEC.  <I>Report of the Presidential Public Funding Program</I>
(April 1993).</small>
</ul>
<P>
Public financing has recently come under increasing attack.  Participation
in the check-off has steadily declined.  In 1993, because of a
projected shortfall in the fund, Congress increased the check-off
to $3, up from the previous $1 level.  For 1993 returns, participation
in the tax form check-off was only 14.5 percent, despite a public
education campaign.  Given the fact that much of the money distributed
from the Fund goes to buy 30-second television spots, one can
understand why some people hesitate to take part.  In a June 1995
column, George Will described the program as &quot;an entitlement
for politicians, funded in a mendacious manner.&quot;  Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-KY) has also been a harsh critic of public financing.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Federal campaign finance laws have not been significantly changed
since 1979, and other shortcomings have become apparent.  For
example, the $1,000 contribution limit has never been adjusted;
by 1992, accounting for inflation, $1,000 was worth only $350.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some would raise or do away with contribution limits altogether
(when you think about it, the idea that you as an individual can
only contribute $1,000 to a campaign is a pretty strong restriction,
but it was upheld by the Supreme Court in the famous 1976 Buckley
vs. Valeo decision).  At the opposite extreme, one has the example
of Jerry Brown.  In his 1992 Democratic primary campaign, Brown
issued a sweeping indictment of the role of money in politics,
limited himself to $100 contributions and ran a guerilla-style,
grassroots campaign.  On the downside, one can see that operating
under such conditions, politicians might actually have to spend
more time raising money than they do now.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another obvious problem with the current system is soft money.
 Corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals can contribute
unlimited amounts to the parties, provided the money is used for
state and local &quot;party-building&quot; activities.  Broad
interpretations of what exactly constitutes &quot;party building&quot;
have opened the soft money loophole.  Fred Wertheimer, former
head of Common Cause, has written that soft money &quot;threatens
to render meaningless all federal limits on campaign contributions
and to destroy the integrity of the presidential campaign finance
system.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enforcement is another weakness.  Former Democratic national chairman
Robert Strauss observed in a 1992 &quot;Frontline&quot; program
on PBS that, &quot;People are not really worried much about violating
the FEC rules.  They figure, 'What the heck, the election will
be over six months before it [a complaint] ever comes up' &quot;

<P>
<B>Primaries</B>
<ul><P>
<I>Eligibility</I>. To qualify for matching funds, a candidate must raise
$5,000 in each of 20 states, consisting of contributions of $250
or less from individuals.  This $100,000 threshold is intended
to distinguish candidates with broad national support.  Candidates
must also agree to abide by spending limits, keep acceptable records,
and undergo a detailed audit.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After eligibility is established, contributions of $250 or less
are matched dollar for dollar with money from the Treasury.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the 1992 prenomination period, the U.S. Treasury dispensed
$43.4 million to 12 candidates.  The maximum amount any candidate
could receive was $13,810,000.
<P>
<I>Spending limits</I>. The Federal Election Campaign Act established
limits on how much a campaign may spend prior to the convention.
 In 1992, the national spending limit was $27.62 million (this
is the original 1974 level of $10 million adjusted for inflation).
 </ul>
<P>
<B>Conventions</B>
<ul><P>
Each major party receives money from the U.S. Treasury to put
on its convention.  In 1992, the figure was $11.048 million.
</ul><P>
 <B>General Election</B>
<ul><P>
If a presidential candidate pledges not to accept private contributions,
he or she receives public financing in the general election. 
In 1992, the Bush and Clinton general election campaign committees
each received $55.24 million ($20 million adjusted for inflation)
from the U.S. Treasury.  Perot did not ask for public funds. 
He contributed more than $60 million to his campaign.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supplementing the federal grants to the campaigns are several
other sources of money, including &quot;coordinated expenditures&quot;
made by the political parties to support their nominees and soft
money which often goes to voter registration and get-out-the-vote
efforts.
</ul><br><br><P>
<B>Additional Resources:</B>
<ul><P>
Federal Election Commission.  The FEC is responsible for interpreting
and enforcing campaign finance laws passed by Congress.  Federal
campaigns are required to file regular financial reports with
the FEC.  These can be viewed in the FEC's Public Records Office,
which is one of the most user-friendly offices in Washington,
D.C.  Rather than waiting in line at the Hard Rock Cafe next door,
stop in and learn about campaign finance!

<H3>SCOTT A. HODGE</H3>
<HR>
<B>GROVER M. HERMANN FELLOW IN FEDERAL BUDGETARY AFFAIRS</B>
<P><IMG SRC="/heritage/staff/pics/hodge.jpe" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10>
<P>
Hodge is the Editor of Heritage's federal government budget and cabinet reorganization book, a five-year plan that outlines a streamlined budget and bureaucracy. He is the primary architect of Heritage's "Putting Families First," a family tax cut and deficit reduction strategy strongly supported in Congress that dramatically changed the shape of the tax and budget debate. Hodge has catalogued more ways of cutting unnecessary spending to eliminate the deficit than virtually any other specialist  in  Washington  outside  of  the  government.  Hodge, has also examined state and local tax policy, as well as privatization of government services.  He holds a B.A. from University of Illinois at Chicago.

<i><font size="-1">Town Hall is the first truly
interactive community
on the Internet to bring Internet users and public policy organizations together under the broad 
umbrella of "conservative" thoughts, ideas and 
actions.  Our goal is to become the mall of ideas in which people congregate
to exchange, discuss and disseminate the latest news and information.  Town Hall is 
committed to inform, educate and entertain the public through this emerging electronic medium.
<P>
The organizations that have chosen to become citizens of Town Hall do not agree on 
every issue, yet that is why Town Hall believes our community is of value.  An 
interactive, open and honest debate of the issues within the conservative community 
will help us all in the fight against those who would sacrifice the individual and freedom
 for 
political gain and big government.

<title>Memorial Day Spotlight</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<h2><b><center>Memorial Day Spotlight</center></b></h2>
<br>
<p>On the last Monday of May, Americans celebrate Memorial Day, honoring 
those who have died for this great nation while serving in combat.  The holiday 
began in 1868, when <a href="http://suvcw.org/logan.htm">General Order No. 11</a> was promulgated by <a href="http://www.outfitters.com/illinois/history/civil/john_logan.html">General John Logan</a>, commanding that May 30th would be a day for "strewing with 
flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of 
their country."
<br>
<p>Although begun as an honor primarily for Union Soldiers who died in the 
Civil War, this holiday, initially called "Decoration Day," was recognized by both 
North and South on the last day of Monday by the end of World War I.  The 
holiday eventually spread to include the fallen of all wars, and became known 
with time as Memorial Day.
<br>
<p>Even though a certain contemporary president may only wish to invoke 
military status when threatened with a lawsuit, there are others in the nation's 
capitol-- both Democrats and Republicans-- who have served our nation in a 
more honorable way.  The story of <a href="http://aspin.asu.edu/~pctp/mccain/mccain.html">John McCain's</a> five years as a prisoner of war and <a href="http://www.dole96.com">Bob Dole's</a>  
wounding in a raid against the Germans in northern Italy in 1945 serve as 
inspiring reminders of the lengths we must go to, should our nation beckon.  
Other veterans of the U.S. wars of our include <a href="http://www.house.gov/samjohnson/welcome.html">Representative Sam Johnson of 
Texas</a>, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens">Senator Ted Stevens of 
Alaska</a>, and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~kerry">Senator Kerry of Nebraska</a>.
<br>
<p>In the words of General John Logan, "let us, then, at the time appointed, 
gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above 
them with choicest flowers of springtime; let us raise above them the dear old 
flag they saved from dishonor... if other eyes should grow dull and other hands 
slack, and other hearts cold in solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the 
light and warmth of life remains in us."
<br>
<p>Thanks to all United States veterans!

<center><h2>CAREERS: Nothing to Strive For</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 <p> 		             

A growing number of state legislators are voicing their opposition to <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a>, known as the <b>CAREERS</b> bill, which would expand and make permanent the School-to-Work Act passed by Congress in 1994. <p>

In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Missouri Republican delegation, 
Missouri legislators said that <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a> "incorporates word-for-word many sections of Goals 2000, include the <b>removal of local control from education</b> and the <b>centralization of power to the federal government</b> including the need for approval from the Department of <a href="http://www.dol.gov">Labor</a> and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a> for a state's proposal to grant money. <p>

"The terms used in the acts are of concern as they refer to items such as a 'skills certificate' which children would be required to earn and which employers would be encouraged to require as a condition of employment.<p>

"Finally, a myraid of new agencies, department, and programs are created...and it appears that a <b>large, centralized, nationwide data collection system</b> will be put in place." <p>

<a href="/townhall/FRC/">The Family Research Council</a> has also expressed concern on behalf of thousands of families across the country. <p>

In a recent <i>Alert</i>, Family Research Council elaborated on the provisions it found unacceptable:
<ul>
<li><b>The inclusion of youth in a seamless system of workforce development</b>.  
The needs of youth are much different from those of an unemployed adult.  Vocational education should be a matter left to the local control of elected boards, not merged into a complex new workforce development infrastructure.
<p>
<li><b>The creation of a workforce development infrastructure</b>.  The CAREERS bill requires the creation of state and local workforce development baords that will oversee all aspects of the "seamless system" of workforce development.  These boards will be appointed, <i>not</i> elected.  
<p>
<li><b>The Labor Market Information System (LMIS)</b>. This system has the potential to collect data on every American employer, worker and student.  Proponents of the bill rationalize LMIS by claiming the need for jobseekers to be able to access information on job openings across the country.  Why should the government duplicate information already provided by trade associations, business journals, and classified ads everywhere?

<br><H2>Kickoff to Campaign '96: The Nomination Process Begins</CENTER></H2>

<br>
This week Town Hall presents a look at the upcoming caucuses and primaries that will play a central role in determining who will be the 1996 Republican Party presidential nominee. A front-runner will soon emerge with a tidal wave of support that should carry him all the way to the GOP convention in San Diego, and to the White House. Past experience has shown that success in these early events is critical to launching a successful bid for the nomination.<P>
For instance, no Republican candidate has has won the party's nomination in nearly a half-century without first winning the New Hampshire primary. The quick pace of the primary season is even quicker this year with the changes in the Louisianna caucus and the Delaware primary dates, and many of the pundits believe that the race will be over by mid March. The Town Hall spotlight shines some light on the small, yet pivotal caucuses and primaries of February.

<br><H2>The Balanced Budget: Will We Ever See It?</CENTER></H2>

Balancing the Budget is a priority of the conservative revolution that swept through Congress in 1994, but so far, the President has impeded the budget process with his vetos.  What could have been done by conservatives in just a few weeks, is now turning into a year long process.  Some pundits are even now predicting that Clinton won't make a deal and take the issue to the voters in November.<P>
Town Hall will keep up on the details and bring them to you as they happen in the Budget Spotlight. Check here often more the lastest news, polls, and opinion as the nation debates the balanced budget.

<P>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight provides you with the chance to learn a little bit about some more of the organizations that run on your hard earned money--government bureaucracies.
 More bureaucracies were featured in last week's Spotlight, and they are now labeled and linked to relevant articles.  <a href="/townhall/infotain/12-11-95/answers.html">Check it out!</a>

<A HREF="8.jpg"><IMG SRC="8.gif" ALT="PHOTO" align="left"></A><h3><a href="http://www.dot.gov">US Department of Transportation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This department was created in 1966 to oversee the growth in urban mass transit programs, air traffic, and construction of the Interstate Highway System.
<li>Because each member of Congress tries to assure that his or her state or district recieve as much pork as possible, this department regularly funds expensive, low-priority projects over more sensible, appropriate ones.
<li>Congress earmaked 129 surface projects, at an annual cost of $250 million in FY 1995. During the same year, $1.5 billion was appropriated for airport grants-in-aid, including nearly $5 million for the Jimmy Stewart Airport in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.
<li>19% (18,000 workers) of its civilian staff was furloughed in the first government shutdown.

<li>Had budgeted $13 billion in fiscal 1996 ($434 billion over the next 5 years) for promotion of profitable US companies in foreign markets.  That's right:  your tax dollars are being spent to advertise for successful corporations.  Rep. Dick Armey called this "Coporate welfare of the worst kind"

<li>It controls how firms move into and out of the regulated sector, and ensures that the rates charged by those firms were "just and reasonable."  Major reforms in the early 1980s reduced the control of this agency over its area of oversight, and increased competition and lowered prices in the process.

This week, President Clinton is sending thousands of U.S. Troops to Bosnia to make peace and not everyone agrees on the goals, reasons, or if we should even be in Bosnia.  This week, Town Hall has assembled several pieces of information from around the net and here at Town Hall.  Check back every day for new additions and later in the week, give us your opinion of the Bosnia mission.

<H2>The Food and Drug Administration<BR></CENTER></H2>
The Food and Drug Administration was created in 1906 to protect Americans from unsafe food and drugs, but over the years, burdensome FDA regulations have slowed the approval process for many breakthrough medical treatments.  This session, the Congress is beginning to address these concerns and FDA reform is beginning to take shape.  Follow the Spotlight this week as we look at what the FDA does and why it should be reformed.

The much-touted "train wreck" has been averted with the adoption of continuing resolutions.  The House and Senate have passed their versions of the budget.  Now members from each house must meet to iron out a final package to send to President Clinton.

Both the House and Senate versions of the budget reduce the government's burden on citizens and introduce better incentives for savings and investment.  President Clinton has vowed to veto any budget that closely resembles those passed in the houses of Congress; some Republicans are in favor of allowing the budget ceiling to expire if Clinton refuses to move to the right.  Who will flinch first?  The political manuevering is bound to be exciting!  
<P>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the final phase of the budget process:  conference.
<P>
On Monday, get a refresher on the budget process and what "conference" is.  You'll also be able to see our national debt, updated continuously, as well as review, line-by-line, last year's budget.  On Tuesday, we take a break from our budget coverage to bring you an election-day special.  On Wednesday our budget battle coverage resumes with links to and analysis of the two versions of this year's budget.  On Thursday, check out the politics behind the battle.  On Friday, e-mail the Budget Conferees with your opinions!  
<p>
Please share your opinions with us any day of the week by filling out our budget battle questionaire.  We hope you find these articles enlightening!

<H2>Affirmative Action in Light of the Million Man March<BR></CENTER></H2>

<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Million Man March & Affirmative Action</a></center>
<P>
In 1965 President Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, mandating "employers doing business with the federal government to develop affirmative action plans to assure equal employment opportunity in their employment practices."  Affirmative action was born.
<P>
  For thirty years affirmative action laws have been a source of tension between whites and minorities.  Some conservatives have even suggested that the Million Man March was not just a call for African-American solidarity, but also a wake-up call to the nation's leadership to deal with the real anger of African-Americans and redouble their efforts to end the "slavery" of assistance programs like affirmative action that suggest, as Shelby Steele put it, "somehow color, not our hard work, can bring us advancements."
<P>
  On 27 July 1995 Majority Leader and Republican Presidential frontrunner Bob Dole introduced the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, proposing that, "...the federal government should not discriminate against, nor should it grant preferences to, any individual because of that individual's race, color, ethnic background or sex."  Will this be the end of affirmative action and the associated tensions?
<p>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the Million Man March and the issues surrounding affirmative action.
<P>
On Monday, we focus on the Million Man March as a backdrop for our discussion of affirmative action.  On Tuesday, read President Clinton's report on affirmative action as well as some reponses to that report.  On Wednesday read two conservative approaches to restoring equal treatment in employment.  On Thursday, read conservative commentary on the Million Man March and critiques of affirmative action.  On Friday we bring you arguments for the end of "quotas."  
<p>
Please share your opinions with us any day of the week by filling out our affirmative action questionaire.  We hope you find these articles enlightening!

<IMG SRC="door.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 align = left><H2>The Door to Town
Hall</h2>
This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading into 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

<H1>Conquest of the Columbia Carried Tremendous Costs</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P>Some books change our thinking about institutions long taken for granted. Marc Reisner's <CITE>Cadillac Desert</CITE> explained how Western water flows uphill toward political payoffs.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> exposed the politics which trump both science and economics in our national parks.  They herald fundamental reform by publicizing the gaps between intentions and results.  They show how agencies created to promote the public interest become part of an iron triangle of special interests.  The beneficiaries become accustomed to the arrangements and view them as entitlements and a way of life.  </P>

<P>Blaine Harden's new book, <CITE>A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia</CITE>, describes such a situation.  The series of dams throttling the Columbia River and its tributaries delivers approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of water each year to 4,000 farmers in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project.  The average Project Farm has received a taxpayer subsidy of at least $2.1 million in the irrigation infrastructure.  The government also guarantees electricity to Project farmers at one twenty-seventh the wholesale price.</P>

<P>Cheap power entices farmers to pump water to their crops, sell excess water to their neighbors, generate electricity from the water flowing through their irrigation canals, and then sell that electricity at market rates.  Ninety percent of the cost of a profitable farm in the Project is borne by taxpayers and electricity consumers elsewhere in the country.</P>

<P>Of course, Project farmers love this system; &quot;The more water they suck out of the river, the more profits they have.&quot;</P>

<P>In the Colmbia Basin, federal hydroelectric and irrigation programs from the New Deal have transformed once-arid farmland into a bountiful region producing alfalfa for Japanese cattle and 80% of America's fast-food french fries.  </P>

<P>In Harden's words, the Columbia &quot;was killed more than sixty years ago and was reborn as plumbing.&quot;  The river where Lewis and Clark encountered &quot;verry bad&quot; whitewater rapids is now operated to mimick a lake sufficiently placid and stagnant for hydroplane races.</P>

<P>Special interests tranformed the Columbia into plumbing.  According to historian Donald Worster, the Columbia was killed by dams and reborn as money.  Hydroelectric dams mean big money to farmers, utilities, electricity consumers, the federal Bureau of Reclamation, and barge operators between Portland and Lewiston, Ida.  New tourist and recreation industries, like windsurfing the Gorge, are inextricably tied to the river.</P>

<P>The federally subsidized conquest of the Columbia had its costs.  Indian tribes lost their culture, their land, and their river.  Today, 60,000 commercial fishing jobs are in jeopardy.  And taxpayers still foot the bill.  The last, and perhaps most pivotal, victim is the endangered salmon, for the conquest of the Columbia has decimated the region's wild populations.  Over a quarter of the Northwest's salmon stocks are extinct, and half are endangered.</P>

<P>We can learn from Harden's stories:  First, to restore the Columbia and its salmon, we must understand the diverse special interests surrounding the river.  And second, subsidies and powerful centralized government action create special interests and institutionalize and channel their support.  The result is overexploitation of both the environment and the federal budget.</P>

<P>Harden repeatedly demonstrates the effects of the &quot;iron triangles&quot; in the Columbia.  An agency embarks on a public works project, private groups organize to collect those benefits, and they in turn support politicians who continue funding the agency's projects.  </P>

<P>Harden tells how this political juggernaut brought pressure to bear on dissenters, like Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">Washington State University</A>, who testified against the inefficiencies and wealth transfers of massive Project subsidies.  Bureaucrats routinely suppressed evidence or simply ignored their deleterious effects on indians, salmon, and the environment.  Farmers, barge operators, and utilities remain in denial.  Harden quotes a teacher at <A HREF="http://www.bbcc.ctc.edu">Big Bend Community College</A> in Moses Lake, Brenda Teals, who says, &quot;Farmers think those irrigation ditches fell out of the sky.&quot;</P>

<P>The vast majority of worthwhile irrigation projects were built privately and without federal subsidies.  Only after the best sites were developed were government subsidies required.</P>

<P>Can taxpayers still afford the iron triangles created by grandiose government schemes?  The nation's taxpayers pay for 80% of most major irrigation projects.  The farmers are encouraged to draw as much water as they can, the federal agencies are encouraged to &quot;operate&quot; the river like a machine, and the politicians are encouraged to appropriate more funds for their contributors.</P>

<P>This iron triangle polarizes Northwesterners.  Harden relates &quot;the most enduring consequence of federal control in my home country was not pollution, but intolerance.&quot;  In Hanford, it was technocrats and technicians against indians and hayseeds.  On the river, it was barge pilots against windsurfers and fish lovers.  Inland, it was subsidized farmers against enviros seeking to dismantle the artificial foundation of the Northwest economy.  Along the Cascade Mountains, it is becoming &quot;East-siders&quot; versus &quot;West-siders&quot;.</P>

<P>The polarization has forest industries blaming dams, fishermen, and farmers. Farmers blame deep-sea gillnets.  Fishermen blame dam builders.  Barge operators blame bureaucratic meddling.  Federal agencies deny responsibility and point to hatcheries.  Utilities claim transporting salmon in trucks is better than letting them swim.  Consensus seems more distant than Lewis and Clark's past.</P>

<P>Salmon and Northwesterners cannot live in harmony when politics generate benefits.  The iron triangles produce toxic byproducts.  As President Clinton has proclaimed, the era of Big Government is over.  Blaine Harden's book tells why we should be grateful. </P>

I recall being scared to close the door, lest anyone remember it had been left ajar, and too timid to take a closer look, in case either parent returned unexpectedly. Little impression of the picture itself remains: a buxom blonde in Li'l Abner costume, breasts partially exposed.
<dd>Such innocent times. I thought of that picture again recently on a trip to Manhattan. I was tired after a long day of meetings and speeches and decided to spend the evening in my room at the Yale Club, ordering in room service and mindlessly watching TV. Unlike most hotels these days, the Yale Club offers no in-room movies, just basic cable service. 
<dd>Too lazy to cross the room and examine the TV Guide, I used the remote to move from channel to channel looking for something to watch. Shortly after 10:00 PM, my channel surfing swept me into unchartered waters. Suddenly I was staring at writhing, naked bodies: three young men, black and white, one wearing only a studded dog-collar; another, a gold cross hanging between his pectorals. 
<dd>I saw more. Simulated sex acts, close ups of tumescent genitals and other body parts and most memorably, the faces of the men, boys really, barely older than my children. After a few minutes, I switched the channel, unable to watch anymore, not even to try to learn what program it was I had happened upon. 
<dd>As shocking as the experience was, I'll survive this unwanted brush with gay pornography. But what about children or adolescents who happen to tune in? And they will, especially those who are already most vulnerable, whose parents aren't around or don't care what their kids are up to at 10 o'clock at night. What effect will those pictures have on the young? 
<dd>After this episode I learned that the cable franchise in New York City has tried unsuccessfully to limit this channel to those customers who send in postcards requesting it, free of charge. A federal district court judge considered this imposition too onerous, stigmatizing those with pornographic tastes. Apparently the judge did not feel it too burdensome to require parents to learn to program their cable boxes if they wished to keep images of sodomy off the family TV. He issued an injunction prohibiting the franchise from blocking the channel, which now remains part of the basic service that
comes into every cable subscriber's home. 
<dd>In his new book Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline, Robert Bork suggests that maybe it is time to re-instate censorship in America. "From the earliest colonies on this continent over 300 years ago, and for about 175 years of our existence as a nation, we endorsed and lived with censorship," Bork argues. That changed dramatically in 1973 when the Supreme Court in Miller vs. California established new standards to determine what may be banned. Courts since then have been reluctant to ban any sexual material as long as it involves "consenting adults." 
<dd>Barely 50 years ago, Bork reminds us, the Supreme Court unanimously wrote: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words." 
<dd>How far we've come since then. Now the First Amendment is regularly invoked to protect as "speech" forms of expression that include "snuff" films that depict the sexual torture and murder of women and children, photographs and videos of men and women having sex with animals, and other abominations too numerous to mention. 
<dd>It is unimaginable that our Founders would have sanctioned this interpretation of the First Amendment, which after all was intended originally to protect political speech deemed necessary for democracy to function, indeed thrive. Are we a freer society today by virtue of being exposed to all manner of filth and smut? Are our children more likely to grow up good, informed citizens ready to perform their democratic duties because they have listened to a steady stream of misogynist and hedonist rock and rap lyrics on the public airwaves? 
<dd>Unless the Supreme Court can see its way out of the morass it has created, maybe it is time to consider amending the First Amendment. Twenty-five years of radical First Amendment jurisprudence on pornography has turned much of the popular culture into a Styxian cesspool. And those of us who would like to avoid being drowned there are told we are anti-democratic. 
<dd>Why must I carefully avoid scanning television channels, or pretend I don't hear the suggestive words emanating from the radio when I take a taxi? Why must I look at sneering, crotch-clutching models in their underwear on the side of city buses? And how am I expected to protect my children if I choose? 
<dd>Surely liberty is not synonymous with licentiousness. And if judges cannot tell the difference, the people will have to show them the way, which is what real democracy is all about.

<title>Pete Du Pont-- Silence of the Lamm -- 08/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Wednesday, August 14, 1996</i><p>


<h2>Silence of the Lamm</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

So, is America ready for a third-party?  Ross Perot thinks so.  So 
does David Broder of the Washington Post, who writes that by 2000, a 
third party will be a major political force in America.
<p>
But if there were a third party, what would it stand for?  What would 
its policies be?  These are the questions bothering the third party we 
already have - Ross Perot's Reform Party - because to date it is a 
party of one man, not a party of ideas.  If it is going to have any 
impact on the American political process, the Reform Party must become 
a party of ideas.
<p>
Take the case of former three-term Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, who is 
trying to get his message out to members of the Reform Party in a 
effort to win the party's nomination for president.  So far, he has 
had only moderate success
<p>
Lamm contends that the Reform Party, founded and largely funded by 
Perot, has hampered his campaign by refusing to let him have members' 
addresses so that he could reach them by mail.  In addition, his 
repeated requests to debate Perot were declined.  Reform Party 
officials deny having done anything to hinder Lamm's campaign or his 
ability to reach party members.
<p>
Lamm stepped into the Reform Party process for two reasons:  He wanted 
a national platform on which to discuss the problems American is 
facing and he apparently believed Perot when for months the Reform 
Party founder denied having any desire to be nominated and run for 
president of the United States.
<p>
Unfortunately, the national media have focused almost entirely on the 
internal struggle for power rather than the issues Lamm and the Reform 
Party have been pushing.  As a result, Lamm's message has been 
silenced.
<p>
But were he able to get his message out he would warn Americans of a 
number of impending problems.  For example:
<p>
<b>Social Security reform</b> - The Social Security system is going bankrupt.  
At its current rate of growth, the trust fund will begin drawing on 
reserves by the year 2013 and will be broke by 2030.  Since our 
elderly population is growing much more rapidly than workers, there 
simply won't be enough workers to keep Social Security solvent.  The 
later we wait, the worse it will be, so we must develop a solution 
now.
<p>
<b>Medicare reform</b> - Medicare is going bankrupt even faster than Social 
Security.  According to Medicare's trustees' report, Medicare Part A 
(which pays hospital bills) will go into the red by 2000 and be broke 
just a year or so later.  Republicans passed a Medicare reform 
proposal, only to have it viciously attacked by the Democrats.  As a 
result, the notion that Medicare is politically untouchable is 
prevailing once again.  That's an attitude we can't financially 
maintain for long.
<p>
<b>Fiscal responsibility</b> - Reagan-era tax cuts increased federal revenues 
between 1981 and 1989 by an average of 1.8 percent per year, after 
inflation.  Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress increased 
spending by 2.3 percent.  That disparity explains the increased 
deficit spending during the Reagan years.  Bob Dole wants to cut 
taxes, but keep the budget balanced.  Would Lamm do the same?
<p>
The problem is that Dick Lamm has spoken out on these and a number of 
other issues over the years, but the media have focused so much on 
Lamm's political struggles, they have failed to give due attention to 
his solutions to our problems.
<p>
That's too bad, because Lamm is a serious politician with a message 
Americans need to hear and consider.  His may indeed be a "root-canal" 
vision of our future - all cuts and no gains - but it is a very 
definite political message that may force the Republicans and 
Democrats to deal with politically difficult issues that candidates 
might otherwise sweep under the table.
<p>
I don't believe Lamm's message will resonate.  Americans are 
optimists, believing, in Steve Forbes' words, in "hope, growth, and 
opportunity."  Lamm's pessimism will be a hard sell.  Further, I would 
disagree with those who say there is a political longing unfulfilled 
by the Democratic and Republican parties.
<p>
To have an impact, third-party candidates will need to debate the 
message, not the man.  So far all we've heard is Ross Perot.  Maybe 
it's time to see what Dick Lamm has to say.  
<p>

 <i> September 4, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. II</h2><p>


<i>If you're sick and tired of judicial activism, take heart. It may not last much longer.</i><p>



"We are constrained by many rules and taxed for many costs that we as self-governing people did not choose for ourselves but were chosen for us by judges who thought they knew better," observes Richard Morgan, professor of Constitutional Law and Government at Bowdoin College. Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Morgan argues that the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education "ushered in the modern era in constitutional law," an era in which the courts came to be viewed "as a source of governmental power that could force unpopular changes that could not be secured through representative institutions." Over the last three decades, the courts "have removed issue after issue from the arena of popular decision and subjected them to judicial control."<p>

Morgan laments the dramatic changes that have taken place in America since the 1960s, "when judicial social engineering based on the Brown model took hold. Huge new bodies of judge-made law constrain us on all sides," he observes. "New restrictions on what Americans can do in their communities, state legislatures, and the national Congress are being fabricated apace. It is no accident that this period of imperial expansion by the judiciary coincides with a period of precipitous increase in the American social problems and a decline in the quality of life, especially in our cities," says Morgan. "The courts did not cause the decline, but they often have made it more difficult for communities, through the processes of self-government, to cope with their problems. In the decades since Brown we have seen our churches and other voluntary institutions . . . increasingly isolated from the public square; we have seen our schools destabilized, our law enforcement enfeebled, the maintenance of order in our streets undermined, and major public-sector institutions taken over and run by judges."<p>

There was no popular support for such judicial abuse in the beginning, nor is there any now, and yet it continues. "After decades of conservative electoral outcomes and hundreds of state and federal judicial appointments intended to end 'judicial legislation,' and with public opinion sullenly resistant to much of the social engineering ordered from the bench, how is it that legally unjustified judicial interventions into policy making and administration still occur routinely?" asks Morgan. "Why does our sprawling 'rights industry' continue to grow and succeed so often in persuading judges to establish policies that cannot be put in place through the normal democratic processes of election and legislation?"<p>

Though leaving such questions unanswered, Richard Morgan insists that the days of judicial activism are numbered. He argues that "curtailing judicial legislation is an absolutely essential part of reinvigorating self-government and arresting social decline in America at the end of the century." The best way to begin, says Morgan, is by recognizing the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Fumento:Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</title>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 22, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</h2><p>     
<P>
<dd>
Hallelujah! Praise the lord and DON'T pass the ammunition!  Why?  Because across the
country, murder rates are plummeting. According to new FBI figures, the rate fell 7 percent
in the first half of 1996, continuing a three-year trend.
<br>
<dd>     
The down side of this is that next to other western countries, the United States is still 
comparable to a World War I battlefield. Whatever we may be doing right, we need to be doing
a lot more. But what ARE we doing, anyway?
<br>
<dd>     
First, let's make clear that anybody who says there's a simple or complete answer is either
lying to you or to themselves. That includes the claims of Sheriff Wild Bill Clinton that he
done rode them varmints outta town on a rail.
<br>
<dd>
"Crime has dropped in the last four years as we worked to put 100,000 police on the streets,"
he said in his January 4 radio address.  He has also repeatedly given credit to the Brady
Bill, which requires a waiting period and background check for handgun purchasers.
<br>
<dd>
But note Clinton's careful wording about those cops. He said he worked to put them there, not
that they actually exist. Indeed, for the most part they don't. Studies show that at most
the legislation has added about 17,000 new officers, and many of those would have been added
anyway but are now simply paid for out of federal funds instead of local ones.
<br>
<dd>
As to the Brady bill, Mrs. Brady humbly boasted at the Democratic National Convention that
her husband's namesake law "has helped keep more than 100,000 felons and other prohibited
purchasers from buying handguns."
<br>
<dd>     
Actually, the White House itself has only claimed 60,000, and a General Accounting Office
report last year found that half of those rejected were for administrative reasons--mostly
paperwork errors. Only 5 percent were rejected because of violent crime convictions and most
probably just proceeded to buy a gun on the streets.
<br>
<dd>
Thus, a University of Chicago study found recently that the Brady Bill was about as effective
as "The Brady Bunch" in preventing crime.
<br>
<dd>
The main way we know that neither Clinton nor anyone in the federal government deserves
credit for falling crime is that about 95 percent of crime is handled by state and local
agencies. That's easily measured, because about 95 percent of the criminals behind bars are
there on state charges, not federal ones.
<br>
<dd>
So what were some of those state and local initiatives that might have helped reduce violent
crime?
<br>
<dd>
One was pointed to in the aforementioned University of Chicago study, which found a direct
correlation between the increasing number of states allowing people to carry concealed
firearms and decreasing violent crimes in those states.  Apparently, many criminals start
rethinking their careers when they realize their next potential victim may exercise his or
her constitutional right to blow their attacker's head off.
<br>
<dd>
The Chicago study made gun control advocates so hot you could have fried eggs on their
heads. Nevertheless, they were unable to refute the data, which showed that when such laws
went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults
fell by 5 and 7 percent, respectively.
<br>
<dd>
On the other hand, the major city with the highest drop in murders, New York, has no such
provision for carrying concealed weapons.  New York may be reaping the benefits of what
criminologist James Q. Wilson has called the "broken glass" effect.
<br>
<dd>
Basically, this means officers take the time to follow up on and prevent even the little crimes
like vandalism that formerly they ignored in favor of concentrating on big crimes. By paying
attention to lesser infractions, the theory goes, the police instill respect for the law and
uphold values in neighborhoods. This then cuts down on the occurance of major crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Clearly something wonderful is happening in the Big Apple, and the broken glass theory
deserves continued application and observation.
<br>
<dd>     
A steady rise in prison capacity may also be helping to reduce violent crime rates.
Since 1980, the nation's prison population has tripled.  Just in the last two years, the
population of state and federal prisons has increased by almost 14 percent.  In the last
four years, the average time served for serious crimes increased by a half.
<br>
<dd>     
In 1994, of those seeking parole, almost 80 percent were denied.  By contrast, in 1990 80
percent who sought parole got it.
<br>
<dd>
But before we wear out our palms slapping ourselves on the back for the decreasing crime
rate, a little humility and caution are in order. Without doubt, one major factor has simply
been a decline in the portion of the populace that is at the age that commits violent
crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Further, to listen to highly respected criminologists like Dr. John Diulio at Princeton
University and David Kopel at the Independence Institute in Colorado, we may just be in the
eye of the storm.
<dd>
The reason?  "It's not just the age of the population, but the conditions under which
it was raised," Kopel explains.  And more and more of our kids are being raised without fathers. 
Without fathers, young men don't turn to Hillary Clinton's "village," to raise them; they
turn to gangs and criminal activity. 
<br>
<dd>
"In 2010 we may be reaping a whirlwind from the family-wrecking policies of the  70s, 80s,
and  90s," says Kopel.  I pray he's wrong.  I fear he may be right.

<h2>
The American President
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Kathleen Howley
</a>

<P>
Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is trying to figure out the way Liberals 
think. Every time I think I have it nailed down, though, the Liberals 
pitch a curve ball.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Take, for example, "The American President," the movie about a highly 
paid female lobbyist who has an affair with the widowed President of 
the United States.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To Liberals, she's an "old-fashioned girl," because, after all, she 
waits until the third date to spend the night at the White House. Not 
the first date, mind you -- she's no tramp, after all. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president's young daughter gets wind of the ongoing affair. She 
approves, as it turns out. When the relationship becomes public and 
some Angry White Male Conservative senators object, they're dismissed 
as being "intolerant."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, the simple solution to the controversy is for the president 
and his girlfriend to get married. It would shut up the big, bad 
Conservatives, and, since it's an election year, it would also give 
the president a boost in the polls. The whole country would fawn over 
the newlyweds. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, it never comes up. The word "marriage" is never spoken -- not by 
the Conservatives, as they plot their election coup. Not by the happy 
couple, as they snuggle in front of the fire at Camp David. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's the part that's hard to understand: Liberals perceive the 
president -- a character modeled, obviously, on a spiffed up version 
of Bill Clinton -- as a man of integrity, despite the bad example he 
sets for his daughter. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That view becomes apparent in the final scene, when the president 
makes a dramatic stand in defense of Liberal environmental 
legislation. Yes, I could almost hear the Clintonites sobbing in 
admiration. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How could a character with no moral backbone be portrayed as being 
honorable? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the same question I was left with at the end of "Primary Colors," 
the anonymous account of the Clinton campaign.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sure, Gov. Jack Stanton (read: Clinton) sleeps with every female in 
sight. Sure, he impregnates the teenage daughter of a friend. Sure, 
he's a pathological lier.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He really CARES about America, though. And that makes everything all 
right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stanton/Clinton is no slacker when it comes to 
extramarital affairs. According to the book, she sleeps with Henry 
Burton, alias George Stephanopoulos. But, that's dismissed as merely 
being "campaign sex."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the end of "Primary Colors," Gov. Stanton/Clinton is presented with 
some under-cover dirt on his opponent. Leaking it to the press would 
secure the primary nomination. But, it's just dirt about sex and drugs 
-- nothing really bad, from a Liberal's perspective. Should he use it? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of his aides tells him, "We don't do this sort of thing. We're 
better than that." In the end, Stanton/Clinton decides to take the 
high road.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once again, I could almost hear the Liberals weeping in admiration. 
What a man of courage! What a leader!  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It explained to me why there have been no denials forthcoming from the 
White House about the book -- no statements of shock or dismay. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You see, to Liberals, it's a relatively positive portrayal. Yes, the 
candidate has a fatal flaw in his inability to be faithful to his 
wife. But, that doesn't really count. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He refused to engage in "dirty tricks." And that makes him a hero. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You might ask yourself: how could two groups of Americans -- Liberals 
and Conservatives -- view the same events with such a radically 
different interpretation? How can Liberals dismiss sexual morality 
from the mix, when deciding who has integrity and who doesn't? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More to the point, how can the Liberal-dominated media lionize 
characters who have such obvious flaws? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's because the Liberals are working from a different set of rules. 
And, as long a politician doesn't break the Liberal code of 
conduct, he's a man of integrity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In short, they follow Ten Commandments, too. But, they're a bit 
different from the code that has guided Christians through the 
millenniums. The Liberal version is: 
<p>
<ol> 
<li>) Thou shalt be nice, except to people who are Conservatives. 
<li>) Thou shalt be inclusive, except to Conservative views. 
<li>) Thou shalt ignore the Lord's Day, unless you are a politician and 
need a "photo op" as you exit a church. 
<li>) Thou shalt blame thy mother and thy father. 
<li>) Thou shalt kill the old, the sick, and the unborn, but 
passionately defend the lives of death row criminals. (Unless you're 
an election-year politician who wants to look "tough on crime." In 
that case, kill them all, including the criminals.) 
<li>) Thou shalt commit adultery, and engage in any other mode of 
sexual expression, with any gender. But, thou shalt not feel guilty. 
<li>) Thou shalt steal, if it helps to re-distribute wealth. 
<li>) Thou shalt lie, if it furthers the Liberal cause. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors wife. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors goods. 
</ol>

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?

God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<title>Rockwell: Who are the True Liberals? -- 9/5/96</title>

<h2>Who are the True Liberals?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
 The word is: the word "liberal" is out. It won't even
be heard at the Democrat convention. Hardly anyone will admit to
being a liberal anymore, meaning a tax-and-spend, 
guilt-manipulating, counter-cultural statist out of touch with
the regular guy. Even left-wing activists prefer the term 
"progressive."<P>
Of course, the Democrats are as liberal as ever, as we've 
come to understand the term. That is, they identify more with the 
government than with the governed. But this approach is an 
electoral loser.<P>
People believe they are being governed--taxed, regulated,
and otherwise pushed around--to death. Never in the history of
American polling has the federal government been so unpopular.
If "liberalism" is about supporting and expanding this
system, liberals will indeed have to find a new ideological cover. <p>

May they succeed! For the word liberal really belongs to those who favor the free economy and society: the sense in which the word is now used in Eastern Europe. The authentic liberal tradition, dating from the 17th century, is properly identified
with the intellectuals and popular movements who struggled against government power.<p>
Liberalism was born in Spain, when the followers of St. 
Thomas Aquinas discovered how economic freedom works to build
a prosperous society. The writings of the late-scholastics, 
centered around the School of Salamanca, bloomed into a worldwide
movement of "los liberales".<p>
In France, the liberals included A.R.J. Turgot, Jean 
Baptiste Say, and Frric Bastiat. In Britain,
Richard Cobden, John Bright, and Herbert Spencer. In Austria, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. In America, Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and William Sumner. <p>
Liberals in this classical tradition understand the connection between welfarism and tyranny, big government and empire, central planning and poverty. Their goal is to establish the rule of law, decentralize government, and let capitalism flourish. <p>
How liberalism came to mean the opposite in this country is a twisted tale. Unlike the Old World, where being on the right meant supporting tyrannous regimes and empires, the New World was conceived in liberty. When the centralists and egalitarians began to undo this, beginning in 1861 and continuing to this day, they
purloined the name liberal for themselves. <P>
Yet even as late as the 1920s, some people who called themselves liberals had no beef with capitalism and self-government. They wanted to protect individual rights from
government power. They would never have countenanced a government
that taxed 40 cents on the dollar, promised cradle-to-grave security,
or forbad freedom of association. <p>
But the New Deal changed that. In the name of liberalism, a northeastern elite fastened a vast coercive apparatus on the country, and took us away from liberty and toward the very tyranny the constitution's framers were hoping to prevent.<p>
The term &quot;conservative&quot; didn't come into common use
for another generation. The opponents of the New Deal had no name
for themselves. They liked the name liberal, but with the term stolen
by their opponents, they resorted to cumbersome names like 
"anti-collectivist," "individualist," and
"America firster."<p>
In the post-war period, liberalism has meant consolidating 
and expanding the New Deal framework, while conservatism came
to mean fighting the Cold War, and preferring tradition to ideology. The really serious opponents of collectivism--those who favored capitalism and peace, economic freedom and civil liberties, property rights and states rights--had no name for themselves.<p>
The right term for these political views is "liberal."
But it ' s very difficult for the rightful owners of a word to take
back its meaning while their opponents are using it. After the American Revolution, for example, the centralizers adopted the term "federalists" and called their Jeffersonian opponents "anti-federalists". To this day, the meaning of "federalism"
is ideologically ambiguous. <p>
Rightly defined, liberalism is the view that society should not be centrally controlled, managed, or shaped by government.
Society manages itself, from the bottom up. Consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, parents, and volunteers form 
communities of enterprise and mutual support, while the central
government is not seen, or heard, or felt. <p>
Today the American political landscape is dominated by two 
anti-liberal parties. One loves the welfare state, the other 
loves the warfare state. One wants to stamp out tobacco, the 
other would use the military in the war on drugs.  &lt;p&gt;<BR>
The fullest defense of the liberal society ever penned came 
from Ludwig von Mises in 1927 as  Liberalismus . Only this 
tradition, he said, can save civilization from Nazism, fascism,
communism, socialism, and social democracy. His warning wasn't
heeded, but when the term is reclaimed, Mises's book should be
the platform. <p>
<i>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., is president of the Ludwig von Mises 
Institute in Auburn, Alabama.</i><p><br>

<h2>Why the District Is Different</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
 <P>
Many taxpayers outside the District of Columbia are saying, "Why is D.C.
getting so much attention and what's all this talk about a flat rate
federal income tax of 15 percent?" After spending nearly two decades as a
District resident and half of that time as a critical observer of
government spending, I admit bias and more than a little pride in my
response, as well as good reasons to move ahead with D.C. Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton's plan.
<P>
This is, after all, the nation's capitol. Instead of being the butt of
late-night talk show jokes, every patriotic American should be demanding
that the District be the crown jewel of U.S. cities, and the envy of every
world capitol.
<P>
Just try walking the nearly four-mile round trip from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument. It's safe, it's beautiful, and there's nothing like it
in any other city. Tourists marvel at the sights, and despite rumors that
make the District sound like the Wild West, they still visit in droves.
<P>
Even with its inability to address bloated and inefficient government, D.C.
is not particularly large, nor are its problems insurmountable. Bold and
decisive leadership would do the trick. But progress along these lines
still would not address a fundamental fact: The city's population is
declining rapidly. In the first five years of the 1990s, the population
dropped as much as it did in the entire decade from 1980 to 1990. And many
of those leaving were African-American and middle class.
<P>
The Norton plan is simple -- lure people back into the District by lowering
federal taxes. Support for the bill includes House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Bipartisan companion legislation has been introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senate Joint
Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack (R-Fla.). Members of the Maryland
and Virginia delegations are also supportive: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.)
said it could help the entire region become more prosperous, and Rep. Tom
Davis (R-Va.) is moving forward quickly with hearings before his House
Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
<P>
The opposition to the proposal comes from the traditional proponents of
class warfare (the plan benefits the rich more than the poor), and people
in other cities who want the same deal. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, seeking a more comprehensive tax reform plan, is not
yet in favor of the Norton bill.
<P>
But Washington is different, and it's well worth the projected annual $700
million in lost revenue to the Treasury. We only need to look at a small
portion of the $160 billion in annual federal spending that my organization
-- Citizens Against Government Waste -- identifies as wasteful spending to
find the necessary offsets.
<P>
For example, Congress could eliminate the Market Access Program ($90
million), the Economic Development Administration ($348 million), the
Advanced Technology Program ($300 million), the Appalachian Regional
Commission ($140 million), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserves ($109
million) and the National Biological Survey ($115 million). These
half-dozen programs total $1.1 billion, more than enough to meet the cost
of this new program.
<P>
The issue is not finding the savings, it's convincing skeptics on Capitol
Hill that it's OK to lose control over hundreds of millions of dollars and
that people in D.C. and people who would want to live in the District --
nearly two-thirds of whom are African-American -- really will know how to
spend the money they save from the tax cut.
<P>
The class warfare argument is specious: Individual taxpayers making $15,000
or less; single head of households at $25,000 or less, and joint filers at
$30,000 or less will pay NO federal tax. That means more than half of D.C.
taxpayers will simply be taken off the rolls. Is there any more direct
manner in which to help and reward hardworking lower income people than to
strengthen their ties to their community?
<P>
For those who continue to pay taxes, but at lower rates, the potential for
creating or expanding business is phenomenal. There are 31,000 sole
proprietorships in the District, meaning they pay the individual income tax
rate. Assuming that a tax of $28,000 (28 percent) on business income of
$100,000 would be reduced to $15,000, that $13,000 would no longer be
diffused throughout the national economy, but would be largely directed at
local spending and investment. The resulting savings is enough to hire a
full-time employee, purchase new equipment, or retire outstanding debt that
will lead to additional business opportunities.
<P>
The kicker in the tax reduction scheme is the elimination of capital gains
taxes for investments in D.C. by District residents. So what would a
<P>
logical person do with their savings? Invest it in local businesses.
<P>
That's what I plan to do -- in fact, I pledge that one-third of the savings
I will obtain from lower taxes will be invested in D.C. businesses, either
directly, or through market opportunities. If every D.C. taxpayer followed
this lead, there would be approximately $233 million (assuming one-third of
the $700 million in revenue lost to the federal government) available for
investment in D.C. Or, if only the richest taxpayers (1994 figures) -- the
4,396 whose income exceeds $200,000 and who paid $600 million, or 35.2
percent of D.C.'s $1.7 billion in taxes -- did the same, there would still
be more than $82 million for city business. Or take the 15,313 returns for
people making more than $100,000 annually. They paid $900 million, or 52.9
percent of 1994 taxes, meaning if they pledged one-third of their savings,
there would be more than $123 million to increase the city's employment and
business base.
<P>
Best of all, that money would not flow through the inefficient hands of the
federal bureaucracy, and it would remain where people know best how to use
it. With what's left over, charitable Washingtonians could support local
nonprofits, the arts, schools, and religion, all of which will be more
direct help to the needy than the federal or local government could ever
provide. And let's not forget what it would mean for this city to have
people wanting to move in, rather than out, of the District. Beyond the
obvious greater tax base, we would enhance the support of institutions that
are key to long-term urban health -- our neighborhoods and our schools.
<P>
All of this may be too logical for the bean counters and those ready to
write off the city's future. But most Americans have a vision of our
nation's Capitol that is rooted in the past and looking to tomorrow. The
Norton plan is the best way to get us all on this hopeful path.

<h2>            
Feminist Assault On Reasonableness
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                    


     Now that women are attending law schools in greater numbers,
     feminists are turning up as law school professors, law review
     writers, state legislators, congressional staffers, prosecutors,
     law clerks, and even judges. The result is ominous for basic
     concepts of American law and justice, and an excellent policy
     analysis on "feminist jurisprudence" by the Cato Institute
     explains why.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminist goal is not fair treatment for women, but the
     redistribution of power from the "dominant class" (the male
     patriarchal system) to the "subordinate" class (nominally women,
     but actually only the feminists who know how to play by rules
     they have invented). They even want to establish a license for
     women to kill their allegedly abusive spouses.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They have peddled the fiction that men are engaged in a vast
     conspiracy against women, that something like 85 percent of
     employed women are sexually harassed in the workplace, and that
     something on the order of 50 to 70 percent of wives are beaten by
     their husbands. They want to establish the rule that offenses
     against women should be defined (not objectively, but
     subjectively) on the basis of how the woman felt instead of what
     the defendant did.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Before the feminist movement burst on the scene in the 1970s,
     there were literally hundreds of laws that gave advantages or
     protections to women based on society's common sense recognition
     of the facts of life and human nature. These included the
     prohibition against statutory rape, the Mann Act, the obligation
     of the husband to support his wife and provide her with a home,
     special protections for widows (e.g., one state gave widows a
     little property tax exemption, another prescribed triple
     penalties against anyone who cheated a widow), and laws that made
     it a misdemeanor to use obscene or profane language in the
     presence of a woman.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The premier feminist lawyer in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
     argued that all such differences of treatment based on gender
     were sex discriminatory and, therefore, should be abolished. She
     won several Supreme Court cases on that theory, and, in state
     after state as well as in Congress, feminist lawyers persuaded
     legislators to gender-neutralize their laws.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In theory, Ginsburg appeared to demand a doctrinaire equality,
     opposing the Mann Act because it "was meant to protect weak women
     from bad men" and that was demeaning to women. But in practice,
     she demanded affirmative action for women even in the military.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists don't even pay lip service to a gender equality
     goal. They have launched a broadside attack on such basic
     precepts as equality under the law, judicial neutrality, a
     defendant is innocent until proven guilty, conviction requires
     proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guilt or liability should be
     judged according to the traditional "reasonable man" theory.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Female plaintiffs had always been able to sue for unwanted sexual
     overtures in the workplace by using the common-law remedies of
     tort and contract. Feminists reject this remedy because they want
     sexual harassment cases to be based on the notion of a male
     conspiracy to victimize women and that a "hostile work
     environment" is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title
     VII of the Civil Rights Act.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Supreme Court adopted this feminist theory in the 1986 case
     of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, where the Court even went so
     far as to say that "'voluntariness' in the sense of consent" is
     not a defense. These notions had been invented by Michigan Law
     School professor Catharine MacKinnon, who was reported to have
     boasted, "What the decision means is that we made this law up
     from the beginning, and now we've won."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A 1991 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision replaced the
     common-law "reasonable man" standard with a "reasonable woman"
     test, embracing the feminist notion that men and women can't see
     the same events in the same way. The court declared that the old
     common-law standard "systematically ignores the experiences of
     women."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists are demanding the "unreasonable woman" rule.
     The feminists want the victim rather than the law to define the
     offense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In a 1991 Jacksonville, Florida case, a federal district court
     found an employer guilty of a "hostile work environment" even
     though there was no evidence of sexual language or demands
     directed at the plaintiff who claimed she felt sexually harassed.
     The other female workers said they did not feel sexually
     harassed, but the judge said that merely provided "additional
     evidence of victimization."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists are actively promoting college speech codes to
     prohibit what they call discriminatory or harassing speech. They
     argue that it's just as actionable for a man to call a woman
     "honey" or "baby" as to call her a "bitch"; and, of course, jokes
     are not allowed. Nearly 400 colleges and universities have these
     anti-First Amendment speech regulations, about a third of which
     target mere "advocacy of offensive or outrageous viewpoints or
     biased ideas."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists want the battered woman syndrome to free any woman
     from conviction of violent crime. The feminists are even pushing
     the Catharine MacKinnon notion that all heterosexual sex is rape
     unless an affirmative, sober, explicit verbal consent can be
     proven.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They want the action of a battered woman who kills her husband to
     be considered as normal, and that killing a man in his sleep can
     be called self-defense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     More lawyers, scholars and academics are badly needed to speak up
     and expose the feminist foolishness for what it is: a scurrilous
     attack on our Bill of Rights.

<p>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cada da estamos ms a la cola en las listas de
pases segn su riqueza y (ser coincidencia?) tambin entre las naciones
que gozan de menos libertad.  Aqu el ciudadano no es libre de hacer nada
por derecho, pues todo requiere una ley que permite que algn brillante
funcionario del gobierno le d licencia o autorizacin.  El dictador no
tiene nombre y apellido; es el funcionario que sabe mejor que Ud. cmo
manejar su negocio.
<p>
Lo primero que debemos reconocer es que la pobreza es culpa
nuestra y slo la podemos curar desde adentro. Las ddivas del exterior que
tanto nos gustan solamente son unas gotas que ms bien sirven de soporfero
humillante y que contribuyen a agrandar la brecha entre los pases ricos y
nosotros porque nos da una falsa esperanza que pospone tomar las medidas
correctas. Y esa ayuda casi siempre viene acompaada de consejos
equivocados, pues los dispensadores de ddivas, debido a la misma filosofa
que los califica para su trabajo, tienen una visin poco realista del mundo
real.

La preocupacin por la brecha entre ricos y pobres es uno de
los factores que no permiten eliminar la miseria porque cuando la riqueza
del pas aumenta, los pobres son menos pobres, pero los ricos son ms ricos.
Tenemos entonces que escoger qu es lo que queremos lograr: eliminar la
pobreza o eliminar las diferencias entre pobres y ricos?
<p>
Volando sobre la capital y observando cmo se ha rodeado de
cinturones de pobreza, me pregunto, cunta gente viene del interior porque
no hay telfonos y por ello no se establecen empresas ni se crean empleos.
Esos cinturones son parte del precio de haber prohibido que cualquiera
pudiera competir en el negocio telefnico en nuestra paternalista Guatemala.  
<p>
Nos tom muchos aos aprender que una tasa de cambio
artificial causaba crisis y, en consecuencia, retrocedimos una dcada.
Despus nos ha costado mucho aprender que haber elevado las tasas de inters
a niveles estratosfricos produce recesin. Cada vez que probamos una
"brillante" poltica incurrimos en el carsimo proceso de aprendizaje.
<p>
La prxima brillante idea es la de privatizar "con creatividad". En vez de simplemente
privatizar, es decir, proceder a vender por subasta pblica internacional las empresas
estatales y dejarlas que operen libremente bajo las leyes generales del pas, ya se
estn inventando ingeniosos modelos, avalados por "brillantes" asesores extranjeros
("empresarios" en recomendar polticas) para que el gobierno dirija la
industria elctrica, d concesiones, otorgue licencias, fije precios, etc.
Todo para que las empresas privadas "no hagan cosas inconvenientes".
Adems, se bautiz a los nuevos ministerios con otros nombres, como
Superintendencia de Comunicaciones o la Comisin Nacional de Electricidad.
Estos pequeos nuevos ministerios, al cabo de los aos, tendrn su propio
edificio, donde se puedan hacer trmites engorrosos. As mismo nacieron el
Inde, Guatel, Minera, Hidrocarburos y tantas otras superintendencias y
comisiones que nos han empobrecido, impidiendo el progreso nacional.  
<p>
La Corte de Constitucionalidad anul la Constitucin y nos
inform que Guatel no es un monopolio telefnico aunque est prohibido
competir con l. Tambin nos dijo que los precios de la energa se pueden
interferir por razones ideolgicas, aunque no cubran costos. Y el nuevo
proyecto de ley elctrica mantiene que los precios de la energa son libres,
siempre que no se usen las calles para distribuirla. Brillante!
Evidentemente seguiremos pobres porque en Guatemala seguimos confundiendo un
rgimen de legalidad con uno de derecho.

<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cuando en Amrica Latina hablbamos de empresas
multinacionales nos referamos a compaas como la Standard Oil, United
Fruit, US Steel o Anaconda. Esas han cambiado sus nombres, han perdido
importancia o fueron nacionalizadas durante nuestra mala racha de socialismo
nacionalista. Pero lo interesante es que hoy varias de las ms vigorosas
multinacionales, en plena expansin en pases como Argentina, Per y Brasil,
son empresas de capital chileno que hasta hace menos de una dcada eran
comatosas empresas estatales, con exceso de personal y que adems de dar
psimo servicio producan inmensas prdidas.
<p>
 Una de estas nuevas multinacionales, Enersis S.A., a fines de noviembre
coloc exitosamente, a travs de J. P. Morgan, Merril Lynch y Salomon
Brothers, $800 millones en bonos con vencimiento en los aos 2006, 2016 y
2026. Parte de esos fondos irn a Brasil, donde Enersis -en asociacin con
empresas elctricas de Espaa y Portugal- acaba de ganar la licitacin para
adquirir por $588 millones el 70% de la Compaa Elctrica de Ro de
Janeiro, una empresa estatal que durante los primeros nueve meses de este
ao logr perder $122 millones.
<p>
 Segn el Wall Street Journal, Enersis hoy en da controla empresas con
valor de mercado por unos $13.000 millones, habindose logrado convertir en
una de las favoritas de los inversionistas institucionales especializados en
mercados emergentes.
<p>
 Jos Yuraszeck, el presidente de 45 aos de Enersis S.A., era a principios
de los aos 70 uno de los valientes jvenes estudiantes que manifestaban su
oposicin al rgimen socialista de Salvador Allende. Luego del golpe
militar, el gobierno de Pinochet le asign la misin de desmantelar el
control estatal en la empresa elctrica de Santiago, Chilectra Metropolitana.
<p>
 Chilectra fue privatizada en 1987 y Yuraszeck logr convertirse en su
administrador con el apoyo de fondos de pensin privados y de los empleados
que adquirieron acciones de la empresa. Poco despus repetira la misma
estrategia para comprar la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa), la ms
grande  generadora de energa elctrica en Chile. Bajo la visionaria
gerencia de Jos Yuraszeck, la capitalizacin de Enersis, la empresa matriz
duea tanto de Chilectra como Endesa, se ha multiplicado 57 veces desde
1988, hasta alcanzar unos $4.000 millones en la actualidad. 
<p>
 Su primera inversin extranjera la realiz el grupo en 1992, en la
Argentina, al adquirir el control de Edesur S.A., una de las empresas
distribuidoras de electricidad en Buenos Aires, a la vez que dos grandes
empresas generadoras: Central Costanera S.A. y El Chocn. En 1994, el grupo
Enersis hara lo mismo en Lima, al adquirir una importante participacin en
la empresa ms grande de energa elctrica del Per. El xito de Enersis en
el extranjero se basa en reducir drsticamente el robo de electricidad y
cambiar el tradicional letargo burocrtico de las empresas estatales de
energa por una vibrante cultura empresarial.
<p>
 Adems de una inversin inicial de $490 millones para la adquisicin de
Edesur, Enersis invirti otros $340 millones en modernizar las
instalaciones, convirtiendo a 360.000 personas que se aprovechaban de
energa gratuita en clientes de la empresa. Edesur pas de perder $62
millones en 1993 a producir utilidades por $59,5 millones el ao pasado.
<p>
 Enersis piensa repetir la misma historia con la Compaa de Electricidad de
Ro de Janeiro, la cual da servicio a 1,2 millones de clientes. El potencial
de crecimiento en el Brasil es inmenso.
<p>
 De todo esto, la primera leccin es que la produccin y distribucin de
energa elctrica nada tiene que ver con "soberana" ni con industrias
"bsicas y estratgicas reservadas al estado" sino, ms bien, con eficiencia
y productividad. La segunda es que hay amplio financiamiento privado en
respaldo de empresas exitosas y empresarios visionarios. Y la tercera es que
hombres como Yuraszeck los hay tambin en pases como Cuba y Venezuela, slo
que la falta de libertad bajo el socialismo los aplasta.

<H2>INFLACION: LA ESPECIALIDAD DE LA CASA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Bardn*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El nuevo presidente del Banco Central de Chile,
Carlos Massad, entreg recientemente unas cifras sobre la inflacin que
conviene consignar. Sostuvo que desde mediados de los aos 30 hasta la fecha
el nivel de precios se multiplic por un factor de 85 millones, de manera
tal que si alguien hubiera guardado o ahorrado en 1936 mil millones de
pesos, tendra hoy solamente once pesos. Naturalmente, la gente no es
estpida y para evitar en parte el robo inflacionario disminuy su demanda
de pesos y se fue a dlares, al ahorro en bienes durables y materias primas
y desde hace unos 30 aos al ahorro en ttulos reajustables, cuando el
gobierno lo permiti y lo legisl.
<p>
 En el intervalo Chile vivi en huelgas porque los trabajadores, con razn,
pedan reajustes de sus remuneraciones nominales.  Los jubilados, que no
podan hacer protestas efectivas, vean que sus pensiones se desvanecan y
todos los chilenos descubrieron, primero a fines de los 50 y luego a
mediados de los 70, que sus fondos previsionales haban desaparecido y que
las solidarias cajas estatales estaban en quiebra. No slo por la
inflacin-robo sino por mala administracin. En Chile, como se sabe,
cambiamos al sistema privado de pensiones y los fondos estn mejor
invertidos en ttulos reajustables, acciones y una amplia gama de valores en
moneda nacional y extranjera. Dems est decir que la inflacin derrib
varios gobiernos, mediante elecciones, y, por la fuerza a Salvador Allende,
en 1973, cuando el aumento de precios lleg a 1000% y la hiperinflacin nos
aplastaba.
<p>
 En 1996 la inflacin fue de 6,5% y en 1997 ser segn Massad, de 5,5%.
Asegura, adems, que hacia fines del siglo Chile tendr una inflacin como
la de los pases industrializados. Sin embargo, no ser fcil porque la
voracidad del gobierno chileno se est pareciendo a la del pasado. Su gasto
ha crecido al 7% real desde 1990 y en 1996 y 1997 se acerca peligrosamente a
los dos dgitos. El fisco mantiene supervit y ahorra porque los ingresos
tributarios han subido por el rpido crecimiento de la economa y por alzas
en impuestos como el IVA, a la renta y otros especficos. Pero el mayor
gasto estatal presiona la demanda interna y con ello la inflacin. 
El Banco Central  se hace cmplice de este mayor gasto manteniendo altas las
tasas de inters y limitando los crditos externos de corto plazo con otro
impuesto que denomina encaje. As se reprime el gasto privado en consumo e
inversin y se le hace espacio al estado para que siga despilfarrando el
dinero de todos en ineficiencia productiva, reajustes a empleados pblicos
que trabajan poco, fomentos intiles y un gasto social enorme que no ha
mejorado los servicios educacionales ni de salud y, se estima, que en ms de
un 60% va a parar a los bolsillos de los que no se clasifican como pobres.
Estos pagan impuestos, como todos, y reciben a cambio algo de lo que queda
despus de las filtraciones a otros sectores y del pago de una frondosa
burocracia.
<p>
 Como es natural, esta poltica terminar por perjudicar la tasa de
crecimiento de la economa chilena y del empleo que ayuda a los pobres
directamente. Esto ya se observa pero se le da poca importancia. Incluso el
premio Nobel Robert Lucas, de visita en el pas, sostuvo que con el vuelo
que agarr la economa chilena con los pasados cambios estructurales poda
seguir creciendo bien un buen rato. Yo, por el contrario, pienso que si no
se corrige la tendencia al alza del gasto pblico, la economa perder
dinamismo y le costar mucho alcanzar las tasas de inflacin de los pases
ms avanzados.

<H2>GANGSTERISMO POLITICO EN VENEZUELA</H2>
<p>
Hctor Betancourt*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En la Venezuela actual, polticos poderosos utilizan a
policas y a jueces para despojar a ciudadanos de sus propiedades. Y no me
refiero a hechos aislados en remotas poblaciones del interior sino a lo que
me est sucediendo a mi, en mi hacienda El Encantado, la mayor extensin de
terreno privado, todava sin desarrollar, en el valle de Caracas.
<p>
 Durante doce aos, el diputado suplente al Congreso Nacional Alejandro
Kaufman ha utilizado el contrato que tiene de administracin del Cementerio
del Este para irse apoderando de los terrenos municipales que rodean al
cementerio, procediendo luego a desplazar linderos, tumbar cercas de los
vecinos y a enterrar muertos en terrenos ajenos. Cuando los propietarios se
vienen a dar cuenta, ya tienen varios cientos de muertos enterrados en sus
tierras, con todas las complicaciones humanas y legales que ello implica.
<p>
 En 1994, el diputado Kaufman se adue fraudulentamente de 100 mil metros
cuadrados de terrenos municipales en complicidad con la Oficina de Registro
del 5 Circuito. Esto fue denunciado al ayuntamiento y al gobierno central,
sin que las autoridades reaccionaran. A mi y a otros propietarios nos
preocupaba porque sabamos que una vez que se adueara de los terrenos
municipales colindantes, Kaufman procedera a invadir y a tratar de
despojarnos de nuestras propiedades, como en efecto ahora est sucediendo.
Kaufman es un personaje que se jacta pblicamente de no tener abogados a su
servicio sino a jueces. Armado de un oficio emitido por la Ingeniera
Municipal que ilegalmente determina que los caminos privados de mi hacienda
son de uso pblico, introduce tractores a mi propiedad para derribar cercas
y portones, respaldado con policas municipales y agentes de la Disip, la
polica poltica, de cuyo director es compadre. Durante la noche y por
varias horas, disparan contra mi casa, donde vivo con mi madre, esposa y
pequeos hijos, para tratar de amedrentarnos y que accedamos a dejarnos
robar. Tambin mantiene intervenidas mis lneas telefnicas y vigila todos
mis movimientos.
<p>
 Parte del problema se debe a la corrupcin rampante en los registros de
propiedad venezolanos. Con unos ttulos de propiedad falsos que incluyen 80
hectreas de mi hacienda, una empresa pirata consigui en 1986 un crdito
por $5 millones en el Banco Industrial, propiedad del estado. Esta hipoteca
fue luego traspasada al Banco Provincial, el banco ms grande del pas. A
pesar que le informamos a la Oficina de Registro y al propio banco que se
trataba de ttulos falsos, en base a la misma hipoteca le aumentaron el
crdito a ms de $20 millones. Cuando la empresa involucrada no pudo pagar
la deuda, el Banco Provincial ejecut la hipoteca y vendi los terrenos el
16 de agosto de este ao a Kaufman por slo $425.000, absorbiendo una
cuantiosa prdida, pero dejando constancia en el documento de venta que no
se responsabiliza del saneamiento de la propiedad. Cmo logra el Banco
Provincial registrar el traspaso de la propiedad cuando los documentos que
tiene son falsos? Pienso que la nica explicacin es que la esposa del
presidente del Banco Provincial es la directora nacional de los registros de
propiedad.
<p>
Cuando denunci estos hechos a la prensa venezolana, la respuesta del
diputado Kaufman fue ingresar a mi hacienda, la noche del 23 de septiembre,
acompaado de 20 hombres, entre ellos policas municipales y agentes de la
Disip uniformados, portando armas de guerra. Kaufman me agredi fsicamente,
rompindome a golpes cuatro costillas, mientras sus secuaces me sujetaban,
todo esto en presencia de mi abogado y del gerente de mi hacienda.
Esa noche ingres a la emergencia de la Clnica Metropolitana de Caracas y
con el informe mdico y las radiografas hice la denuncia ante la Polica
Tcnica Judicial al da siguiente, siendo examinado por funcionarios de la
medicatura forense. Seguidamente, el diputado Kaufman logra que mi denuncia
sea pasada a la jurisdiccin de la juez Mari Carmen La Riva Ron, quien me
llam a declarar y tambin a los mdicos forenses que haban elaborado el
informe. Ellos dijeron -bajo alguna presin- que sus firmas haban sido
falsificadas. La juez, entonces, procedi a emitir el 16 de diciembre una
orden de arresto en mi contra por calumnia agravada y por forjamiento de
documentos.
<p>
 Quien haya ledo el reportaje sobre las crceles de Caracas aparecido en la
primera pgina del Miami Herald el domingo 22 de diciembre, bajo el ttulo
de "Infierno en la Tierra", sabe que nadie en su sano juicio se entrega en
Venezuela y mucho menos durante vacaciones judiciales, cuando los ciudadanos
quedamos totalmente desamparados. Por ello me vi obligado a fugarme en una
avioneta a una isla del Caribe y de all me vine a Florida. Una vez
concluidas las festividades de ao nuevo, tengo todas las intenciones de
seguir en mi lucha por conservar intacta la propiedad que hered de mi padre.
<p>
 Comprendo que el sector poltico venezolano me considera una anomala. En
mi pas, quienes no tenemos padrinos polticos no estamos supuestos a
enfrentarnos a los poderosos sino a negociar con ellos, de manera que lo que
nos quitan sea compensado con alguno de los privilegios que polticos y
funcionarios graciosamente estn en capacidad de asignar. Yo no estoy
dispuesto a convertirme en cmplice del gangsterismo poltico venezolano y
tengo la intencin de dejarle a mis hijos la misma herencia limpia que
recib de mi padre.

<H2>PROPIEDAD PRIVADA Y DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
Julian Morris*
<p>
SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Despus de la II Guerra Mundial,
polticos y  economistas se obsesionaron con el tema del desarrollo
econmico. Las naciones fueron clasificadas segn su producto per capita;
aquellas con un producto per capita mayor se designaron "desarrolladas" y
las dems "subdesarrolladas". Instituciones multilaterales como el Banco
Mundial y el FMI que se haban creado para revivir a Europa devastada por la
guerra, pronto se dedicaron a una nueva misin: fomentar el desarrollo
econmico en los pases atrasados. Miles de millones de dlares se gastaron
en proyectos que supuestamente lograran alcanzar la meta del desarrollo.
<p>
 Lamentablemente, los planes simplistas de polticos y burcratas
infrecuentemente alcanzan sus magnnimos propsitos. As sucedi, en parte
porque el dinero lo prestaron a gobiernos que sufren de corrupcin endmica
(se estima que la riqueza personal del presidente Mobutu es igual a la deuda
nacional de Zaire) y tambin porque los proyectos fueron mal concebidos. Por
ejemplo, inmensas obras hidroelctricas benefician a empresas de aluminio
pero poco hacen por eliminar la pobreza entre campesinos que viven en
tierras ridas.
<p>
 En los aos 80 comenz a surgir la preocupacin de que estos proyectos
grandiosos tenan un impacto negativo en el medio ambiente, especialmente
las represas que inundan la selva y obras de riego que salinizan las
tierras. Entonces, el primer ministro noruego, Gro Harlem Brundtland,
invent el trmino "desarrollo sostenible", reconociendo que el desarrollo
industrial no es en s mismo algo positivo, sino que debe lograrse dentro de
un marco legal que proteja el derecho de individuos a no ser perjudicados,
tanto ahora como en el futuro.
<p>
 En la compleja sociedad moderna, la mejor manera de asegurarse que el
desarrollo se lleve a cabo de manera sostenible es descentralizando lo ms
posible el poder de decisin. Esto conlleva a responsabilizar a individuos
por conservar los recursos naturales. Cuando una persona es duea de un
recurso tiene  la motivacin para conservarlo porque sabe que se beneficiar
de l maana, el ao que viene, dentro de una dcada y sus herederos dentro
de un siglo. Cuando los polticos controlan los recursos tienen un menor
incentivo de conservarlo porque su principal inters es ser reelecto.
<p>
 Un reciente estudio de Alex James de Cambridge University encontr que las
inversiones en reservas de animales depende de quien las administra. La
menor inversin se hace en las reservas que son administradas y que
pertenecen al estado; algo ms en las reservas que son del estado pero
administradas independientemente y la inversin es mucho mayor en aquellas
que pertenecen y son administradas por el sector privado.
<p>
 Otra condicin necesaria para el desarrollo sostenible es que los
individuos puedan intercambiar (vender) los derechos de propiedad. Es
deseable que cada recurso se utilice de la manera ms eficiente y ello slo
ocurre cuando cada recurso es utilizado por el individuo que lo valora ms,
para lo cual es necesario que se pueda traspasar libremente la propiedad.
<p>
 Tanto las naciones industrializadas como las naciones en desarrollo
comienzan a darse cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales son a menudo
exageradamente costosas. Adems, muchas regulaciones tienen consecuencias
dainas al medio ambiente. Un ejemplo clsico ocurri en Bolivia, donde se
prohibi la tala de ciertos rboles. Tan pronto la gente se enter de que
iba a salir el decreto, se cortaron muchsimos de esos rboles.
<p>
 Es ms efectivo el cuido del ambiente cuando se les permite a individuos
hacerlo. En Inglaterra, los pescadores han protegido a los ros de la
contaminacin demandando a industrias que los ensuciaban. Lamentablemente,
las regulaciones que estipulan un mximo de emisiones contaminantes de hecho
le dan a las industrias el derecho de contaminar hasta ese lmite. Si vamos
a avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible debemos revisar las bases en que se
fundamenta la regulacin ambiental.

<H2>LAS CUENTAS DEL GRAN CAPITAN</H2>
<p>
Agustn Navarro*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Las "Cuentas del Gran Capitn" son definidas por
el Diccionario de la Lengua Espaola como aquellas cuentas "exorbitantes y
formadas arbitrariamente y sin  justificacin". Algunos autores refieren que
el Gran Capitn Gonzalo de Crdoba present partidas de descargo ante el Rey
de Npoles, que venan a ser as:  "200.736 ducados y 9 reales para frailes,
monjas y pobres que rueguen a Dios por la prosperidad de las armas
espaolas; 100 millones en picos, palas y azadones; 100.000 ducados en
plvora y balas; 10.000 ducados en guantes perfumados para preservar del mal
olor de los cadveres de los enemigos tendidos en el campo de batalla;
170.000 ducados en poner y renovar campanas destruidas con el uso continuo
de repicar por nuevas victorias conseguidas sobre el enemigo; 50.000 ducados
en aguardiente para las tropas en un da de combate; milln y medio de dem
para mantener prisioneros y heridos; un milln en misas de gracias y Te Deum
al Todopoderoso; tres millones de sufragios por los muertos; 700.492 ducados
en espas y cien millones por mi paciencia en escuchar que el Rey peda
cuentas al que le ha regalado un reino".
<p>
 Cualquier semejanza de las cuentas anteriores con la campaa
presidencial mexicana en 1994 y en especial con los gastos electorales en la
ltima eleccin de gobernador en el Estado de Tabasco es pura coincidencia.
Como se ve, este asunto de las cuentas alegres es un recurso muy viejo y
desgastado. 
<p>
La nica innovacin que se advierte en la vetusta tecnologa del maquillaje
de las cifras oficiales es que en Mxico las Cuentas del Gran Capitn se
fabrican con anticipacin a las batallas electorales, como ocurre ahora ante
las cruciales elecciones de 1997, en que estarn en juego la renovacin
total de la Cmara de Diputados, parcial de la Cmara de Senadores, seis
gobernaciones estatales y la sede del Gran Capitn, la gran Ciudad de Mxico.
<p>
 Veamos un caso ejemplar de la tecnologa local en el manejo
de cifras: la milagrosa recuperacin de las reservas internacionales del
pas, proeza casi comparable con nuestra eficacia para perderlas en un
santiamn, en 1994. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn Don Miguel Mancera, presidente
del Banco de Mxico, son ms o menos las siguientes: Reservas
Internacionales al cierre: $17.509 millones, $1.768 millones ms que en
1995. Magnfico! Sin embargo, los $5.829 millones de activos netos no toman
en cuenta los pasivos con el Fondo Monetario Internacional por ms de
$13.260 millones. As, las presuntas reservas desaparecen y la falsedad de
las Cuentas del Gran Capitn queda en plena evidencia. Respaldar al Peso con
deuda externa (FMI) no es sano ni correcto ni ha sido una defensa efectiva
contra los ataques especulativos. Siempre terminamos ms endeudados.
<p>
 El artificio de convertir prstamos en reservas, como un
engao preelectoral no tendra mayor efecto si por el otro lado no
estuvieran aumentando la circulacin de dinero sin respaldo. En septiembre,
la Base Monetaria andaba en 47.806 millones de pesos y a finales de
diciembre estaba en 87.434 millones, un espectacular 83% de aumento. Por lo
menos necesitamos $11.000 millones propios, no prestados,  para darle un
respaldo  firme a los Pesos que andan circulando hoy en da. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn en las que el gobierno est
apostando para conservar la mayora de Congreso deben exhibirse, porque
constituye un engao premeditado con fines polticoelectorales. Ni la
fantasiosa macroeconoma est tan bien (ah vienen todos los dficits!) ni
mucho  menos ha mejorado la microeconoma real de los bolsillos y la boca de
los mexicanos. Arriesgar nuevamente al pas a una crisis recurrente mediante
gasto pblico, inflacin monetaria, ms impuestos y subsidios no slo pone
en evidencia esa incapacidad tcnica para gobernar que debe pronto terminar,
sino la inmoralidad de hacer poltica bajo la premisa de que el fin
justifica los medios.

<H2>GLOBALIZACION DE LA ECONOMIA</H2>
<p>
Luis Pazos*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace poco una periodista me present en Panam
como  partidario de la globalizacin. Es frecuente que cuando explicamos un
fenmeno econmico, que se da independientemente de que estemos de acuerdo
con l o no, inmediatamente nos adjudican etiquetas. Lo importante para
muchos intelectuales no es explicar el fenmeno sino ubicarlo dentro de
ciertas tendencias y con base en ello aplaudirlo o criticarlo. Esa actitud
es tan absurda como acusar de partidario de las tormentas a aquel que
explica porqu llueve.
<p>
 La globalizacin no es una moda ni corresponde a un esquema neoliberal; es
producto del avance tecnolgico, fruto de las innovaciones y descubrimientos
del siglo XX.
<p>
 Bajo el trmino globalizacin entendemos el intercambio generalizado de
bienes y servicios entre pases y continentes. Hace siglos, cuando el
principal transporte era el burro o el caballo, el comercio no poda llegar
ms all de unos cuantos kilmetros a la redonda; ahora que un avin recorre
en menos de un da los puntos ms distantes del planeta tambin las
mercancas lo pueden hacer. El fax, la comunicacin va satlite, el correo
electrnico y la transferencia de fondos en unos segundos de un punto de la
tierra a otro son instrumentos que han propiciado la globalizacin de la
economa.
<p>
 Ante las tormentas y la lluvia no es relevante ser de derecha o de
izquierda, sino salir con gabardina y paraguas. Ante la globalizacin, no se
trata de estar a favor o en contra, sino de prepararse para operar
eficientemente bajo esa nueva circunstancia. Si ignoramos la lluvia, nos
mojamos. Y si como profesionales, empresarios o nacin pasamos por la alto
la globalizacin, nos quedaremos atrasados, empobrecidos y seremos desplazados.
<p>
 Desde el punto de vista profesional, la globalizacin implica un esfuerzo
adicional  para capacitarse y conocer los adelantos tecnolgicos referentes
a nuestra especialidad, no tan slo en nuestra ciudad sino de todas partes.
Como empresario es necesario identificar las tcnicas que usan no slo
nuestros competidores de la misma regin, sino de todo el mundo, con quienes
tarde o temprano estaremos compitiendo tambin. Como gobernante y poltico
significa tener en cuenta que las leyes fiscales, laborales, ecolgicas,
comerciales, industriales, etc. sern comparadas y evaluadas con respecto a
las de otros pases, y seleccionando entre las naciones que brinden mejores
condiciones los inversionistas decidirn dnde invertirn, crear empresas,
empleos y, por lo tanto, mejores niveles de vida.
<p>
 La globalizacin es la internacionalizacin de las actividades econmicas
debido a la reduccin de las distancias, de los tiempos y la simultaneidad
de la informacin a nivel mundial. No es una moda, sino un fenmeno producto
de la tecnologa en las postrimeras del siglo XX.

<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El presidente Clinton declar que haba terminado la era
del gobierno grande. Como los republicanos llevan aos argumentando que el
gobierno es demasiado grande, parece que ambos partidos ahora se pondrn de
acuerdo en reducirlo. La pregunta es cunto.
<p>
 La respuesta corta es que el gobierno debe ser entre 60% y 80% de su tamao
actual para maximizar el crecimiento econmico y el bienestar social. Las
propuestas presupuestarias de ambos partidos reconocen que el gobierno ha
crecido por encima de su tamao ptimo, pero ninguno de los dos partidos ha
hecho propuestas sobre cmo reducirlo hasta alcanzar ese tamao ptimo.
<p>
 Con el propsito de determinar ms exactamente el tamao ptimo de los
gobiernos, recientemente complet un estudio con los profesores Harrison y
Linn Fox, patrocinado por la Fundacin Krieble, que analiza la relacin
entre crecimiento econmico y el tamao del gobierno central en 57 pases,

estadsticas razonablemente confiables y cuyo Producto Interno Bruto era de
ms de $5.000 millones, sin incluir aquellos cuya economa depende de
exportaciones petroleras. Utilizamos slo datos de los gobiernos centrales
porque los regionales y locales no son muy confiables en muchos pases.
<p>
 Debido a que los gobiernos locales gastan entre 5% y 15% del PIB, nuestros
resultados subestiman el tamao verdadero de los gobiernos. Por ejemplo, el
gobierno federal de Estados Unidos gast en 1996 21% del PIB, mientras que
los gobiernos locales gastaron 12%, para un total de 33%
<p>
 Encontramos que se maximiza el crecimiento econmico cuando los gastos del
gobierno central alcanzan entre 10% y 15%. Por encima de eso, la tasa de
crecimiento consistentemente se reduce a medida que crece el tamao relativo
del gobierno. Otras investigaciones recientes, utilizando cifras de Estados
Unidos, indican tambin que en este pas el tamao del gobierno est muy por
encima del ptimo que maximizara el bienestar general.
<p>
 Por ejemplo, un estudio de 1995 de la Universidad de Ohio concluye que "el
tamao ptimo del gobierno federal es alrededor de 17,6% del PIB".  La
investigacin del National Center for Policy Analysis concluye que para
"maximizar el crecimiento econmico, la combinacin de tasas de impuestos
federales, estadales y locales debe totalizar entre 21,5% y 22,9% del PIB.
Este estudio del profesor Gerald Scully implica un sector gubernamental
central de aproximadamente 15% del PIB y que el actual tamao de los
gobiernos locales son exagerados tambin.
<p>
 No es ningn misterio que los gobiernos han crecido demasiado. Los grupos
de presin siempre tendrn mayor motivacin en la exigencia de nuevos y ms
extensos programas gubernamentales que aquellos otros grupos que piden
moderacin. Los impuestos y la habilidad de endeudarse de los gobiernos
imponen costos significantes a la economa y reducen los incentivos para
trabajar, ahorrar e invertir. Los gastos gubernamentales raramente tienen
los mismos controles que caracterizan al sector privado y pocas veces estn
sujetos a rigurosos anlisis de costo/beneficio.
<p>
 El gobierno grande es un fenmeno relativamente nuevo, en gran parte
causado por la influencia de socialistas y keynesianos, quienes al contrario
de los prceres de nuestra independencia ven al gobierno como una panacea en
vez de como una amenaza. Histricamente, la participacin del gobierno en el
PIB era modesta en casi todos los pases. Un reciente estudio del FMI
muestra que en las naciones industriales ms avanzadas el gasto
gubernamental como proporcin del PIB aument de un promedio de 8,3% en 1870
a 47,2% en 1994. Para 1929, el gasto total del gobierno en Estados Unidos
era 10% del PIB y del gobierno federal un minsculo 2,6% del PIB.
<p>
 El nfasis de la accin poltica debe cambiar de la nivelacin del
presupuesto a ms bien maximizar el crecimiento econmico. La realidad es
que la clase poltica se opone a medidas en favor del crecimiento porque el
bienestar general que se lograra reduce la dependencia de aquellos que
reparten los beneficios que otros pagan. 
<p>
 Aunque podemos claramente afirmar que una reduccin significante del tamao
del gobierno aumentar substancialmente el crecimiento econmico, tambin
tenemos que estar conscientes que a muchos polticos les interesa que esto
no se sepa. Mientras los medios de comunicacin y los empresarios no estn
dispuestos a educar a la gente en este sentido, los polticos seguirn
insistiendo en perjudicarnos dndonos tanto gobierno.

<H2>PERU: APERTURA EDUCACIONAL</H2>
<p>
Jos Luis Sardn
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En trminos polticos y econmicos, 1996 termin resultando un
mal ao para el Per. Es temprano para calcular el dao que la toma de la
residencia del embajador japons por guerrilleros del MRTA har a la
economa peruana, pero ya sabemos que en 1996 se redujo notoriamente el
impulso en los procesos de estabilizacin y reforma estructural.
<p>
 Por primera vez desde 1991, en 1996 la inflacin fue mayor a
la registrada en el ao anterior, al alcanzar alrededor de 12%. As, en el
campo fundamental de la estabilizacin macroeconmica se empieza a observar
un retroceso respecto de los notables logros obtenidos en la primera mitad
de la dcada.
<p>
En el campo de la reforma econmica es verdad que se llevaron adelante,
contra las presiones demaggicas tradicionales, algunas privatizaciones
claves, como la de PetroPer. Sin embargo, tambin es cierto que los agentes
econmicos han recibido seales confusas que desdibujan el claro perfil de
las libertades econmicas antes establecidas. Un ejemplo reciente de ello
son las marchas y contramarchas en la legislacin laboral.
<p>
 No obstante este turbio panorama, a fin del ao fue
promulgada una ley que permite alentar grandes esperanzas. Se trata del
Decreto Legislativo 882, Ley de Promocin de la Inversin en la Educacin,
la cual resumida en trminos telegrficos reintroduce los derechos de
propiedad en el sector y, por tanto, devuelve a la iniciativa privada la
responsabilidad de las decisiones bsicas del proceso educativo.
En el Per no existe sector ms intervenido por el Estado que el educativo.
A nivel de los colegios, el Ministerio de Educacin tiene todava poderes
infinitos, herencia de la dictadura militar. A nivel de las universidades,
la situacin era igualmente grave, desde que estaban sujetas a un nico y
rgido esquema legal la Ley 23733, de 1983, al que deban ajustar su
organizacin y su funcionamiento. 
<p>
 Desde tiempos del general Velasco Ibarra, el rgimen legal
de las universidades ha sido profundamente hostil a la iniciativa privada.
Siguiendo las ideas del movimiento de reforma universitaria de Crdova, de
1918, la dictadura militar instal en este mbito un modelo de organizacin
cooperativo, inspirado en el tab ideolgico segn el cual las actividades
acadmicas deben ser realizadas por instituciones no contaminadas por la
bsqueda de ganancias.
<p>
 Con decisin y coraje saludables, la nueva ley ha atacado el
problema de fondo del sector, al reconocer los derechos de propiedad de las
entidades promotoras de las instituciones educativas particulares. Al
hacerlo, les brinda una marco legal bsico que les asegura las libertades
indispensables para disponer la orientacin axiolgica, la organizacin
administrativa y el rgimen de gobierno de este tipo de instituciones.
As, pues, ya no sern los expertos reales o supuestos del Ministerio de
Educacin quienes tomen las decisiones claves vinculadas al proceso
educativo. Tampoco sern los cuerpos colectivos asamblesticos, con sus
tortuosos procedimientos de votacin annima, perfectamente irresponsables.
Ahora stas correspondern a quienes invierten y arriesgan sus recursos
personales o familiares en instituciones educativas particulares.
<p>
 Al atreverse a romper prejuicios viejos y profundamente
arraigados en la sociedad peruana, el actual rgimen ha dado muestras de una
importante capacidad para reinventarse a s mismo. Viendo la evolucin del
proceso poltico peruano en una amplia perspectiva, y recordando los muchos
sufrimientos y esfuerzos que ha costado llegar al punto en el que ahora
estamos, cabe desear que esta ley nos augure un mejor 1997.

<H2>DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
James M. Sheehan*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El "desarrollo sostenible" es la razn de ser de
numerosos tratados y convenciones de las Naciones Unidas. Se trata del
pretexto ambiental para ampliar el poder de las burocracias nacionales e
internacionales en controlar la economa. Este tipo de planificacin central
se considera esencial para evitar que se agoten los recursos naturales y
para prevenir la contaminacin y la destruccin de la diversidad biolgica.
Los defensores del desarrollo sostenible exigen el establecimiento de un
marco de restricciones generales a las libertades individuales y econmicas,
al comercio, al progreso econmico y tecnolgico, a la agricultura.
<p>
 El desarrollo sostenible se fundamente  en la idea de que la globalizacin
de la tecnologa y del crecimiento econmico son inherentemente destructivos
del medio ambiente. Sin embargo,  las habituales predicciones apocalpticas
sobre la extincin de recursos naturales nunca han resultado ciertas. Los
crticos del capitalismo no toman en cuenta sus poderosas fuerzas
innovadoras. En un mercado libre, los empresarios compiten en desarrollar
soluciones eficientes, a bajos costos, para enfrentar problemas de escasez
de recursos, permitiendo que la gente haga ms con menos. El capitalismo ha
producido mayor nmero de innovaciones beneficiosas al medio ambiente que
cualquier otro sistema econmico. Aunque tal dinmica no existe en las
economas socialistas, las propuestas para un desarrollo sostenible se
copian la planificacin central socialista.
<p>
 La influyente Cumbre de Ro de 1992 defini el desarrollo sostenible como
el principio fundamental de la poltica ambiental mundial. Desde entonces,
burcratas internacionales, activistas ambientales y funcionarios de
gobiernos nacionales han desarrollado un creciente cuerpo de leyes
internacionales que incluyen tratados y acuerdos como la Agenda 21, la
Convencin Climtica Mundial, la Convencin de Biodiversidad y el Tratado de
los Ocanos. Estos tratados imponen costosas regulaciones y mayores gastos
estatales en programas derrochadores de ayuda internacional. Tales
transferencias se canalizan a travs de la Agencia para Desarrollo
Internacional del Departamento de Estado, la Facilidad Ambiental del Banco
Mundial y varias agencias de la ONU. Se trata del comienzo de un plan
ambiental centralizado.
<p>
 Las iniciativas ambientales promulgadas bajo el pretexto del desarrollo
sostenible tambin amenazan el futuro econmico de las naciones en
desarrollo. "Ecoimperialismo" es una nueva tendencia bajo la cual las
naciones industrializadas imponen nuevas normas ambientales al resto del
mundo. Las naciones en desarrollo, con las poblaciones ms pobres, son las
que ms sufren por tales restricciones. Estos pases temen que sus esfuerzos
por salir de la pobreza sean proscritos como "ambientalmente insostenibles"
por los pases industrializados, los cuales no enfrentaron las mismas
prohibiciones cuando avanzaban en su propio desarrollo.
<p>
 Los patrocinadores del desarrollo sostenible no ven el papel que juega la
pobreza en la degradacin ambiental. Las sociedades ricas gastan recursos
voluntariamente en mejorar la calidad ambiental, sin coercin gubernamental,
pero las naciones pobres no pueden darse ese lujo. Los habitantes de
naciones pobres son ms vulnerables a enfermedades, desastres naturales y
deficiencias alimentarias; ms de dos millones de personas mueren cada ao
por falta de salubridad bsica. Por lo tanto, una poltica mundial que
restrinja el desarrollo econmico bajo el pretexto de la "sustentacin" har
dao tanto a la gente como al medio ambiente.
<p>
 La historia nos muestra que la planificacin central caus una severa
degradacin ambiental en la antigua Unin Sovitica. Y la calidad ambiental
es un asunto local, no global, por lo que una exagerada centralizacin hara
ms dao que bien. Lo lgico es que las naciones compitan entre s con
diferentes enfoques. Los pases que efectivamente desregulan sus economas
tienden a promover ms rpidamente su desarrollo econmico, instrumentan
tecnologas ms limpias y crean la riqueza que har luego posible mejorar el
medio ambiente.
<p>
La bsqueda del "desarrollo sostenible" a travs de la expansin de la
autoridad reguladora y de burocracias internacionales conducirn
inevitablemente a fracasos econmicos y ambientales. El verdadero desarrollo
sostenible puede ser alcanzado slo por medio de las instituciones del
mercado: derechos de propiedad, intercambio voluntario y seguridad jurdica.

<H2>REFORMAS INCOMPLETAS EN AMERICA LATINA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Vargas-Llosa*
<p>
LONDRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- "El manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano" ha sido un
xito de librera en toda Amrica Latina. All los autores, utilizando algo
de humor, tratamos de destacar la incapacidad de nuestra clase poltica e
intelectual de renunciar a viejos mitos que por muchos aos han dado
explicaciones erradas a nuestras miserias.
<p>
 Pero el libro tambin desafa ese nuevo y peligroso mito que sostiene que
en Amrica Latina se est viviendo una revolucin de libre mercado. Es un
peligro grave y latente que ese valeroso pero limitado experimento
reformista -reduciendo la inflacin y el nmero de empresas estatales, a la
vez que muestra cierta hospitalidad hacia el inversionista extranjero- est
reanimando la oposicin populista y debilitando la economa de mercado
precisamente porque se trata de reformas incompletas.
<p>
 Si menos empresas estatales, menor inflacin y mayor inversin extranjera
fuesen suficientes para lograr estabilidad y prosperidad -un vuelco al
capitalismo- entonces Amrica Latina sera ya prspera desde hace tiempo.
Tuvimos tiempos, antes de la ola estatista, cuando la poltica monetaria no
estuvo frenticamente fuera de control. En esa poca, la inversin
extranjera se vea por todas partes; tanto que todas nuestras revoluciones
socialistas -desde Mxico en 1910,  Bolivia en 1952, Cuba en 1959 y Per en
1968- llegaron al poder en nombre de la "soberana". Pero la miseria persisti.
<p>
 Si una eficiencia macroeconmica fuera suficiente para lograr una sociedad
libre y prspera, porqu sigue Amrica Latina atrasada a pesar de haber
crecido a un promedio de 5% anual desde 1940, un crecimiento superior al
europeo en el mismo perodo?
<p>
 La respuesta es que las reformas parciales, concentradas en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin un claro compromiso con los derechos de propiedad,
mercados competitivos y slidas instituciones judiciales y polticas
conducen a sistemas mercantilistas que le niegan a las mayoras las
oportunidades y los beneficios del crecimiento econmico.
<p>
 Dos grandes debilidades afectan el actual proceso de reforma
latinoamericano. La primera es que se confunde a la empresa privada con el
capitalismo de libre mercado. La segunda es que el nfasis es en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin tomar en consideracin el orden institucional. 
<p>
 Las privatizaciones no son panaceas. Privatizaciones mal concebidas han
reemplazado monopolios pblicos con monopolios privados, transfiriendo la
propiedad mientras se protege el mercado y se fomenta escandalosamente la
corrupcin. Un ejemplo son las telecomunicaciones. Por toda Amrica Latina
los usuarios sufren de altas tarifas y mal servicio porque las empresas
telefnicas se vendieron a monopolios privados. Esto resulta obvio en Per,
Mxico y Argentina. Entonces los usuarios concluyen que el capitalismo, no
su ausencia, es la causa de tales abusos. No comprenden que eso es lo que
sucede cada vez que se transfieren mercados cerrados del control pblico al
privado.
<p>
 Problemas similares ocurren en gran variedad de servicios. El transporte
pblico en Buenos Aires est en manos privadas, pero cada ruta es un
monopolio de alguna empresa, por lo cual los argentinos estn en contra de
la privatizacin.
<p>
 Esos desaciertos son utilizados por los enemigos de las reformas, como el
poderoso sindicato colombiano de las telecomunicaciones que controla a la
mayora de los 14 mil empleados de la compaa de telfonos colombiana. En
su oposicin a la privatizacin, el sindicato apunta los defectos del
monopolio telefnico privado en Per.
<p>
 Esta proteccin de monopolios tambin crea la percepcin que liberalizacin
significa conceder privilegios a los ricos. Los 15 mexicanos que aparecen
entre los hombres ms ricos del mundo se beneficiaron de privilegios
concedidos por el estado. A su vez, el pueblo mexicano tiene pocas razones
para apoyar un proceso que los ha empobrecido.
<p>
 Por todo el continente se mantienen sectores intocables, llamados
estratgicos. El mejor ejemplo es el petrleo. En Venezuela, a pesar de los
fenomenales $250 mil millones generados en los ltimos 20 aos por su
monopolio estatal petrolero, se estima que 80% de la poblacin vive por
debajo del nivel de pobreza. Sin embargo, sugerencias sobre la privatizacin
del petrleo es respondida histricamente, como sucede tambin en Mxico y
con Codelco en Chile.
<p>
 Amrica Latina ha ignorado olmpicamente la importancia de instituciones
tales como la justicia, la propiedad privada, monedas slidas y hasta la
misma democracia. El resultado es un proceso de reformas con bases dbiles
que invitan al desastre.
<p>
 La falta de reforma institucional est muy extendido. Los derechos de
propiedad no se toman en cuenta o son evadidos por el gobierno. Durante los
aos 80, en un proceso silencioso, los campesinos peruanos de hecho
privatizaron 60% de las tierras que haban sido colectivizadas por una
reforma agraria socialista en los aos 70. Sin embargo, cuatro millones de
parceleros andinos todava no tienen sus ttulos de propiedad.
<p>
 En Mxico, el derecho de propiedad difcilmente existe con el artculo 27
de la Constitucin que mantiene que "la nacin" es la duea de todas las
tierras. La muy mentada reforma del ejido no se ha traducido en derechos de
propiedad para los campesinos. No es posible confiar en las instituciones
peruanas luego que el presidente disolvi al Poder Judicial en 1992,
reemplazndolo por otro polticamente subordinado. Esa institucin no evit
que el Per, segn el informe de Amnista Internacional de 1996, se
convirtiera en el pas en Amrica Latina con ms presos polticos -unos
1.100- despus de Cuba. En Amrica Latina se aparta la libertad econmica de
su esencial base poltica e institucional.
<p>
 En Amrica Latina jams se ha intentado una reforma liberal. El idiota
latinoamericano   siempre atribuye nuestros fracasos a conspiraciones: la
Doctrina Monroe, la United Fruit, el FMI, el Banco Mundial. El ltimo
enemigo es el neoliberalismo, o sea las reformas de libre mercado.
Nuevamente se apunta donde no es.

<H2>LAS MENTIRAS ACADEMICAS</H2>
<p>
Walter Williams*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Muchos ejecutivos de empresas se preguntan cmo
es que tantos de sus empleados que se han graduado de universidades no son
capaces de escribir un memorndum, hacer algunos clculos sencillos o pensar
y expresarse lgicamente. Aqu les doy una muy pequea parte de la
respuesta, contndoles sobre un reciente evento "educacional" en mi universidad.
<p>
 El Centro de Servicio Educacional y de Liderazgo Estudiantil de la
Universidad George Mason distribuy invitaciones para la "Cena del Hambre",
un evento promocionado como educacional "para la comunidad estudiantil
acerca del efecto dramtico del hambre a nivel mundial. La cena dramatiza la
desigual distribucin de recursos como elemento que contribuye al hambre" y
la velada prometa promover "el anlisis crtico, analtico e imaginativo
sobre los que basar decisiones ticas".
<p>
 Luego de donar dos latas de sopa o $3, a cada estudiante asistente a la
cena se le daba un boleto. El color del boleto que a cada uno, por suerte,
le tocaba indicaba su categora en la cena. A 16 estudiantes le tocaron
boletos del "Primer Mundo" y ellos fueron conducidos formalmente a una mesa
cubierta con un mantel de hilo y adornada con flores, donde disfrutaron de
una cena de cuatro deliciosos platos, mientras escuchaban msica clsica
interpretada por un do de flauta y oboe. Se les dijo que ellos
representaban al 15% de los habitantes de Estados Unidos, a los ricos.
<p>
 A otros 30 estudiantes le tocaron boletos del "Segundo Mundo". Comieron
hamburguesas con papitas fritas en platos de plstico y mesas sin mantel.
Les dijeron ser los representantes del 25% de la poblacin que apenas logra
cubrir sus necesidades bsicas.
<p>
 Los 140 estudiantes con boletos del "Tercer Mundo" recibieron un vaso de
agua y media taza de arroz, para que lo comieran con las manos, sentados en
el suelo. Se les inform que representaban a los pobres, 60% de la poblacin
de Estados Unidos. 
<p>
 Un conferencista de la Coalicin de los Sintecho expuso que el hambre y la
falta de viviendas se debe a la poca construccin a precios razonables que
hay, a falta de empleos que paguen salarios aceptables y a falta de
servicios de salud a precios asequibles. Tambin dijo a los estudiantes que
Estados Unidos tiene suficientes recursos para acabar con la pobreza, pero
prefiere dedicarlos a gastos de defensa.
<p>
 Este evento, tpico entre muchos otros que a diario se montan en nuestras
universidades, no fue ms que propaganda, indoctrinacin y mentiras
dirigidas a mentes jvenes ya repletas de falsos sentimentalismos. La parte
ms insidiosa fue la que fomenta la envidia. Darle agua y arroz al 60% de
los asistentes, con el mensaje de que ellos representaban a los pobres de
Estados Unidos, es repugnante.
<p>
 Los hechos son diferentes. Los pobres en este pas son 14%. La obesidad es
un mayor problema nutricional entre los estadounidenses pobres que la
flacura. Los pobres de Estados Unidos comen ms carne y tienen ms espacio
en sus viviendas que los europeos de clase media. En 1993, los gastos del
gobierno federal, estadal y local para combatir la pobreza ascendieron a
$324.000 millones, mientras que el costo de la defensa nacional fue $291.000
millones.
<p>
 Para completar una velada de propaganda poltica, la medicina socializada
del Canad fue presentada como el mejor ejemplo a seguir. Nadie mencion a
los pacientes canadienses que cruzan la frontera para ser tratados en
hospitales estadounidenses ni el hecho de que cualquier ciudad grande de
Estados Unidos tiene ms equipo mdico moderno que todo el Canad.
<p>
 Este centro propagandstico en mi universidad es apenas una pequea muestra
del creciente equipo de indoctrinacin presente en nuestras casas de
estudios, con el fin de confundir y engaar a nuestra juventud, promoviendo
la lucha de clases. Esto sucede por dos razones: la generacin de Woodstock
ocupa hoy los cargos administrativos, mientras que los sndicos elegidos
para supervisar las instituciones universitarias no estn cumpliendo con sus
obligaciones.

<H2>ONLY EIGHT OF 150 WORLD ECONOMIES RATED "FREE" ON 1997 "INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM"</H2></CENTER>
<p>
	<B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years.
<P>
	That's just one of the findings from the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a 520-page book that rates economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. 
<P>
	The major finding of the "Index" -- a joint publication of The Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the global business newspaper -- is clear: "Countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic growth than those with less economic freedom," say co-editors <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, Heritage policy analyst, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. 
<P>
	The problem is, only eight countries have economies that can be classified as "free," according to the study.  This is down from 11 last year, but up from seven in 1995, the first year the "Index" was published. All told, the 1997 "Index" shows that 78 countries have economies that are either "mostly unfree," like Bangladesh, or "repressed," like Libya and Cuba, but only 72 countries whose economies earn ratings of "mostly free" or "free." 
<P>
	The British colony of Hong Kong (which reverts to Chinese control on July 1, 1997) is credited with having the freest economy in the world, thanks to its low taxes, almost non-existent trade barriers, world-class banking system and minimal regulation. The other seven countries with "free" economies, in descending order, are Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Of the 18 countries that earned the label economically "repressed," the five worst (starting at the bottom) are North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq and Vietnam.
<P>
	The "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors -- trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	Besides providing an annual snapshot of economic freedom around the world, the Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" is a powerful tool to explain why some countries (and their people) prosper, while others lag behind. In a new chapter added this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between the degree of economic freedom in a country and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Bangladesh, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. "The key is economic freedom."
<P>
<B>An Investor's Tool</B>
<P>
	In another new chapter added this year, <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Deputy Editor (International) George Melloan examines how the "Index" can be used by those engaged in "country risk analysis," a rapidly emerging field spawned by the rush of Western capital into foreign markets. Americans alone, for example, purchased $51.2 billion in foreign stocks and $46.8 billion in foreign bonds in 1995. Foreign direct investment in developing countries totaled $90 billion.
<P>
	While Melloan concedes that country risk analysis involves a lot of guesswork, he says "it goes without saying that open systems where there is a high degree of economic and political freedom are easier to assess than closed or partly closed systems."  It is here that the "Index" shows its value, pointing risk specialists toward countries whose economic freedom makes them more attractive investment opportunities. 
<P>
	For example, the countries in the upper regions of the "Index" -- such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany -- also receive straight A's from the bond-rating firm of Standard & Poors, marking them as sound investments. 
<P>
	But there are also cases where countries that score poorly on the "Index" are viewed by risk analysts as worthy investments. China is a case in point. Ranking only 125th on the "Index," China has nevertheless attracted a flood of foreign investment in recent years -- $27.5 billion in 1993, up from $4.3 billion in 1991.  Melloan says this in no way invalidates the importance of economic freedom to a country's development, but rather reflects both the attractiveness of China's sheer size and its skillful ability to capture foreign investment. Moreover, he says, China's economic resurgence almost certainly will not last unless its leaders further reduce government intervention in its economy.
<P>
	In the end, country risk analysis is "a little bit like critiquing art," Melloan says. "Most of the specialists think they know a good risk when they see it, and the more freedom of decision-making they see in any given system, the more likely they are to judge it favorably. That is why the 'Index of Economic Freedom' is a valuable tool for the investor."
<P>
<B>Foreign Aid: More Harm Than Good</B>
<P>
	If the "Index" explains what works in moving countries up the economic ladder, it also explains what doesn't: foreign aid. In fact, the data demonstrate that "instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says co-author Bryan Johnson. 
<P>
	Because many long-term U.S. foreign-aid recipients have unfree or repressed economies, Johnson says, the money spent on them is useless or even harmful. Consider:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	All told, of the 78 countries ranked as mostly unfree or repressed on the "Index," 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson says. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer today than they were in 1965.
<P>
	Johnson notes that countries graduating to the developed world in the last 20 years -- such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. At the same time, he says, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a region receiving large amounts of foreign aid, have remained impoverished. The difference, again, is economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the African nations haven't. 
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>
	"If development aid is essential to economic prosperity," Johnson asks, "why has there been so little progress by the countries most dependent on foreign aid? The fact is, poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies." 
<P>
<B>Regional Breakdown</B>
<P>
	Some of the key findings of the 1997 Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" concerning specific regions and countries include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Europe.</B> Switzerland remains the economically freest country in Europe (and fifth overall), followed by the United Kingdom (seventh), the Netherlands (ninth), and the Czech Republic, Denmark and Luxembourg (all tied for 11th). While some formerly communist countries continue to advance toward economic freedom, with the Czech Republic and Estonia (25th) leading the way, others are making little progress, including Bulgaria (108th), Russia and Albania (tied for 115th). Interestingly, Germany (20th) is the only country in Europe to receive a worse score in each successive edition of the "Index," the latest drop stemming from a failure to complete its privatization of state-owned industries.
<P>
<LI><B>Latin America.</B> Chile (22nd) has surpassed Panama (31st) as the freest economy in Latin America, due largely to progress on reducing trade barriers and eliminating price controls, Johnson says. By contrast, little progress has occurred in Mexico (94th), which continues to have a mostly unfree economy. Colombia (78th) and Venezuela (108th) both have received worse scores in each successive edition of the "Index," while Guatemala (50th), Peru (64th) and Ecuador (75th) have each recorded successively better scores. Cuba's economy remained repressed.
<P>
<LI><B>Asia.</B> Despite enthusiasm from the investment community, Vietnam (143rd) remains economically repressed, owing to corrupt border officials, inadequate foreign investment laws, and minimal protections for private property. Japan's score remained unchanged from last year, as did its status as one of the world's 11 freest economies. Overall, the countries of Asia remain a striking mix of the economically free -- Hong Kong (first), Singapore (second), Taiwan (seventh), Thailand (23rd) -- and the unfree -- North Korea and Laos (tied for 148th), Myanmar (formerly Burma, 140th), and China (125th).
<P>
<LI><B>Africa.</B> Of the 40 African countries graded, not one received a score of free, seven received scores of mostly free, 26 scored mostly unfree, and seven were repressed. Morocco was the freest (46th) while Somalia and Libya (tied for 143rd) were the most repressed. Of the 18 repressed countries worldwide, more than a third are in Africa.

<H2>FOREIGN AID CAN IMPEDE ECONOMIC
GROWTH IN POOR COUNTRIES, 1997
"INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM" SHOWS</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
        <B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If there's one thing poor countries don't need, it's more U.S. foreign aid.
<P>
	That's the conclusion of the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a global survey that measures economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. On this point the "Index" is clear: It is the level of economic freedom enjoyed by citizens and businesses in a given country, not foreign aid, that matters most in achieving economic growth. 
<p>
	If anything, the study argues, foreign aid does more harm than good. "Instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says Heritage Policy Analyst <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, co-editor of the "Index" along with <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>'s editorial page. 
<P>
	Economic freedom, by contrast, produces high rates of economic growth. For example, the 10 economically freest countries on the "Index" -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, the Bahamas and the Netherlands -- all have high standards of living. But the 10 least economically free countries -- North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq, Vietnam, Somalia, Libya, Iran, Azerbeijan and Angola and Myanmar -- all suffer from chronic poverty. "The 'Index' demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest levels of economic freedom also have the highest living standards," the editors say.
<P>
	A joint publication of <A HREF="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</A>, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <A HREF="http://wsj.com"><I>The Wall Street Journal</I></A>, the global business newspaper, the "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors: trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). The 10 least-free economies listed above are not alone. All told, the 1997 "Index" finds, 78 countries are either "mostly unfree" or "repressed," while only 72 countries are "mostly free" or "free."
<P>
<B>The Fruits of Foreign Aid</B>
<P>
	Of the 78 countries ranked as economically unfree, 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson found. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer than they were in 1965.
<P>	"The facts show that no amount of foreign aid can correct conditions caused by economically repressive policies," Johnson says. As evidence, he offers some particularly glaring case studies:
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	By contrast, those countries that have graduated to the developed world in the last 20 years -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. The difference, Johnson says, comes down to economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the aid-dependent nations haven't.
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received a half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>
	Similar findings from the first edition of the "Index," published in 1995, led Congress to re-examine how the U.S. government dispenses foreign-aid dollars. In the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, lawmakers included a provision that requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to report to Congress each year on the relative economic freedom of recipient countries.
<P>
	"If development aid is essential to economic prosperity," Johnson asks, "why has there been so little progress by the countries most dependent on foreign aid? The fact is, poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies." 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	The evidence that economic freedom leads to prosperity is more than anecdotal. In a new chapter added to the "Index" this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between a country's degree of economic freedom and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Haiti, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. 
<P>
	By way of example, Beach notes that if the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years. "The key is economic freedom," Beach says.

<center><h2>ON EVE OF SUMMIT, ASIAN COUNTRIES QUESTION U.S. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<P>
	<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1996</b> -- When President Clinton attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines next Monday, he'll have some explaining to do. Specifically, he'll have to tell America's Asian trading partners why his administration seems so much less committed to free trade than it used to be, according to a Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
<P>	"The president's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region," says Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a>. In fact, the administration's vacillation on free trade has damaged U.S. credibility so badly that one Asian leader, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, has revived the idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. 
<P>
	Open trade with the 18 APEC economies (including Canada, Mexico and Chile) is crucial to America's future, O'Quinn says. Taken together, APEC economies have a gross domestic product exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. Nearly two-thirds of America's two-way merchandise trade is with APEC countries, and exports to APEC countries provide jobs for 7.3 million American workers. 
<P>	For this reason, O'Quinn says, it is important that President Clinton take <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc144.html">specific steps</a> to reassure Asia about America's commitment to free trade with the region, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Asking Congress for "fast-track" authority to negotiate free-trade agreements without getting bogged down in contentious labor or environmental issues;
<P>
<LI> Bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of 1997, which would show other APEC countries America's willingness to embrace free trade with a country not on the U.S. border;
<P>
<LI> Inviting other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Peru, to join APEC, which would shift the balance of power within the trade group away from the "go slow" countries of China, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia; and
<P>
<LI> Asking Congress to eliminate agriculture-export subsidies and the sugar and dairy programs, which would improve relations with a number of APEC nations (and save U.S. taxpayers $10 billion a year).

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>HERITAGE CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> <FONT SIZE=4>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1996 --</FONT></B> The 105th
Congress should take full advantage of the revolution in telecommunications
technology to make available on the Internet all disclosable information
having to do with the laws it passes and how it conducts its business,
a pair of Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1098.html">said today</a>.
<P>
 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, director of Heritage's Government
Reform Project, and research assistant August Stofferahn, &quot;By
taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on
the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of
specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more
complex freedom of information procedures established for the
executive branch.&quot;
<P>
 In addition, the analysts say, the move would provide a needed
reform. &quot;Through key institutional and procedural reforms,
the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network
of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades,&quot;
Weinstein and Stofferahn said. &quot;A Congressional Freedom of
Information Act (CFOIA) would complete and confirm the move toward
open access to Congress.&quot;
<P>
 In addition to areas that already have been opened to the public
through the Internet -- such as THOMAS, the Library of Congress'
on-line legislative information service, and the GPO (Goverment
Printing Office) Access system, which features 58 information
databases produced by the federal government -- the U.S. House
of Representatives' Task Force on Committee Review already has
recommended that Congress' new open-door policy be expanded. Specifically,
the task force has called for amendments to bills, committee and
subcommittee prints and reports, and oversight plans and activities
to be placed on the Internet. Similarly, the U.S. Senate has sought
to use information technology to publicize its activities more
extensively through its &quot;Operation Daylight.&quot; 
<P>
 But Weinstein and Stofferahn say Congress should go further.
Under a CFOIA, all information currently made available to the
public would become available through the Internet. In addition
to the committee documents detailed by the House task force, Congress
would add issue briefs, spending reports, voting records, the
content of mass mailings, financial and lobbying disclosure documents,
and a host of other items.
<P>
 &quot;Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means
to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected
representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back
room politics than any other single reform,&quot; the analysts
say. &quot;The 30 million American families with personal computers
would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the
activities of Congress and their particular representatives. In
addition, other citizens could take advantage of the numerous
possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university
libraries to find timely information on current legislation that
may affect their lives.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Overall,&quot; Weinstein and Stofferahn say, &quot;these
changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive
to the average citizen.&quot;

<title>Next Administration Can Restore U.S. Free-Trade Leadership in Latin America -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>
NEXT ADMINISTRATION CAN RESTORE 
U.S. FREE-TRADE LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1996 </b> -- The most important trade goal for the next administration should be the creation of a hemisphere-wide <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1092.html">free-trade area</a> linking the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the South American Common Market (Mercosur), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and other countries into a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the collapse of the Mexican peso on Dec. 20, 1994, but the United States has not," according to Latin America and Trade Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John P. Sweeney</a>. "The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization and efforts to create an FTAA. However, the United States appears to have turned its back on Latin America, allowing U.S. relations with important trading partners to deteriorate significantly on issues such as trade, Cuba, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and allowing countries like Brazil to fill the leadership vacuum."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sweeney says U.S. reluctance to expand NAFTA to other countries such as Chile has not interrupted hemispheric trade expansion -- it has simply left the United States out. "Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Mercosur also wants to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union," Sweeney points out. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"No one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free-trade express in the Western Hemisphere," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Among the 10 steps Sweeney says the next U.S. administration should take to regain its leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America:<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track trade negotiating authority.</b> "No country will invest the time or human or financial resources necessary to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress," Sweeney points out. "Making renewal of fast track one of the first actions of a new administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the United States has re-engaged in the FTAA process," he says.
<p>
<li><b>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.</b> "The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur," Sweeney says. Also, NAFTA has enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the United States, causing the rate of growth for apparel imports from the CBI countries into the United States to fall from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996. Apparel imports from Mexico grew by 41 percent during the same period. To redress this unforeseen imbalance, Sweeney says, the CBI countries should be included in NAFTA. 
<p>
<li><b> Launch a dialogue for integrating NAFTA and Mercosur into an FTAA by 2005.</b> "The United States has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing," Sweeney says. "Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade practices as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005."
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis, and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration is reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on track," Sweeney says. "If the administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline."

<title>Poor Children Would Benefit From School Choice, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2> POOR CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM 
 SCHOOL CHOICE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 26, 1996</b> -- As the new school year begins, Congress will be considering legislation that would allow tax dollars to be used for special scholarships so poor children can attend the schools of their choice, private or public. According to a Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1088.html">study</a> released today, such scholarships could make a real difference in the lives of children from poor families. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The proposed legislation, called Title II, The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would allow each locality to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maximum value no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education in the local public school district.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose schools they prefer," says <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>, senior fellow in education at Heritage and author of the study. "The  reason why the Clintons and the Gores, as well as other members of the nation's social and political elite, select private schools is simple: Empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority students," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For example, Doyle says compelling research by the late Johns Hopkins and University of Chicago scholar James Coleman points out that Catholic schools have benefitted poor and minority children in numerous ways. Coleman's research found, for example, that Catholic school sophomores scored 10 percent higher in science, 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading and vocabulary than their public-school+ counterparts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A recent study by Harvard University and the University of Houston confirmed Coleman's research, showing that elementary school students who participated in the nation's first school-voucher program in Milwaukee scored higher on math and reading tests after four years than youngsters who stayed in public schools. In Milwaukee, 99 percent of the students receiving vouchers were black or Hispanic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Unfortunately for poor children, their only current educational choice lies in selecting between failed and failing public schools. The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996 offers a good first step toward giving poor children and their parents more and better educational options," Doyle says.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 1996</b> -- A new approach to local police management emphasizing high recruitment standards, "community policing," and a high-tech focus on crime "hot spots" and repeat offenders -- coupled with a judicial system that keeps criminals behind bars -- can win the war on crime, according to a major Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">analysis</a> co-authored by former Attorney General <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III.</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
	The 33-page report, released today, proposes 21 specific actions local, state and federal officials can take to achieve the same dramatic reductions in crime that have been achieved in cities like New York, where in 1994 the murder rate declined 45 percent and major felonies dropped 12 percent (and 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995). 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident," according to Meese and co-author <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a>, Ph.D., Heritage's deputy director of domestic policy studies and the son of a Philadelphia police detective. "They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The most important lesson taught by the experience of the past several decades of rising crime, according to Meese and Moffit, is that police must be: 1) Well-paid, high-quality individuals in both achievement and character, actively recruited from the communities they patrol or from the military; 2) savvy peacekeepers, known personally by the neighborhoods they serve, able to spot troublemakers and, more often than not, quell disturbances before criminal acts occur; and 3) allowed to do their jobs, and not be constantly second-guessed by department higher-ups, nor demoralized by judges whose ideas of social justice put criminals back on the streets. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"If we're going to spend billions of dollars on combating crime," Meese and Moffit write, "we ought to use that money in the ways that have been shown to work and stop wasting them on ways that don't." For example, Meese and Moffit point out that the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which President Clinton vowed would place 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets, has increased the number of officers by just 17,000, and even these aren't necessarily in areas hardest hit by violent crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the advice Meese and Moffit offer to local police:
<p><ul>
	<b><li> Target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> "Successful police departments should focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place," according to Meese and Moffit. "Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. These areas should by the targets of short-term, unpredictable crackdowns that tell the criminal he stands a serious chance of getting caught. Police should also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime. They should be a routine target of police," they say.
<p>
<li><b> Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> "Too many metropolitan areas in the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical and character standards within police forces," Meese and Moffit say. If local police departments expect to make a dent in crime, they need to insist on high standards in both cognitive ability and personal integrity. 

<p>
"Responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits," Meese and Moffit say. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, "psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical strength and stamina requirements are also essential," they say. Most important of all, "background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, current and past associations and financial and marital stability, as well as evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse."
<P>	<li><b> Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> "Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies," Meese and Moffit say. These officers should be put "on the beat" and their administrative duties performed by clerical or other qualified personnel.  
<p>	<li><b> Aggressively recruit police officers from the ranks of the military, which would expand the number of well-qualified black and other minority applicants. </b> It is important that police departments reflect the demographic composition of their communities, especially in minority neighborhoods. This enables officers to understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit information vital to effective law enforcement, Meese and Moffit say. 

<p>
But local officials "should not be deceived by the false god of 'diversity' at the cost of excellence in the field." Instead, they say, local police departments "should aggressively seek out those members of minority groups who meet the high cognitive, physical and moral standards of the department, and offer them a pay level that will make law enforcement an attractive career option."	
<p>	The military offers a pool of personnel -- many of them minorities -- with many skills that would be useful in police work, they say. 
<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> "The most effective police officer is an insider; someone local residents know and respect. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible," say Meese and Moffit. Better still, "if the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors." For this reason, Meese and Moffit say local officials should consider offering low-cost housing loans as an incentive for police to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 
<p><li><b>Make police commanders directly accountable for results and police conduct.</b> It is absolutely essential, Meese and Moffit say, for police commanders to be held personally accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions, as well as the integrity and honest of their officers. This method, strictly followed by former NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton, resulted in "precincts that operated as miniature police departments," and managers who "rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity." </ul><p>
<b>What Washington Can Do</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Among the steps Congress can take that will truly aid state and local governments in combating crime, Meese and Moffit say, are the following: <ul>
<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety, and reform criminal procedure so it once again serves the purpose of putting criminals behind bars.</b> The Senate, which approves nominees to the federal judiciary, should refuse to give its consent to nominees who have a history of rulings that result in the release of criminals. 
<p>	In addition to what it has already done -- putting a stop the federal imposition of "prison caps," which commonly resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminals -- Congress should review the impact of the Miranda ruling, the so-called exclusionary rule, and reform the law to allow a good-faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations Meese and Moffit say. "As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of police," they say. 
<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those that impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> "Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities," Meese and Moffit say. "The Clinton administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more ... Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- and allow states and cities to solve their own problems."
<p><li><b>Provide more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> Meese and Moffit say this would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime," Meese and Moffit say. "In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	But success, they say, rests ultimately on intangibles as "courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community."

<h2> THINK TANK ECONOMIST IDENTIFIES
<br>THE "WORST TAX OF ALL" </h2></center>

<P>

<u>Calls for Estate-Tax Repeal</u>
<p>


	WASHINGTON, AUG. 19, 1996</b> -- It may be absent from political radar screens this election season, but a Heritage Foundation economist has identified what he considers the "worst tax of all."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It's the estate tax, and in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">new study</a> released today Heritage John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says it should be repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Consider the evidence, Beach says. The estate tax can confiscate a crushing 55 percent of an individual's lifetime assets, yet is so inefficient it may cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue. The estate tax slows the economy by encouraging consumption over investment and by keeping interest rates artificially high. And the estate tax punishes some of the very people "progressive taxation" is supposed to help: female and minority business owners struggling to enter the economic mainstream.<p>
<b>A Paltry Revenue Source</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Along with the gift tax, which requires payment of taxes on the value of lifetime gifts from parents to children, the estate tax brings in less than 1.7 percent of the federal government's total revenue. In 1995, for example, the tax generated just $14.7 billion in revenue -- but may have lost up to $11 billion, Beach says, as individuals shed their assets by giving them away to charities and others. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the primary reasons for this paltry revenue figure is the extraordinary lengths to which individuals will go to avoid paying estate taxes, Beach says. Not only do individuals spend an inordinate amount of time and money on "estate planning," which has become a euphemism for tax avoidance, but when that proves insufficient they resort to the next defensive measure: spend as much of their money as they can. In this way, Beach says, individuals only pay tax on their wealth as income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent, compared to the maximum rate of 55 percent under the estate tax (which, on top of the income tax, results in a tax bite of almost 70 percent).<p>
<b>Spend It Before You Die</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It doesn't even matter what they spend the money on -- cars, boats, second homes, even presidential elections. "The fact is," says Beach, "that the estate tax encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment on which he'll pay a 55 percent tax. The thinking behind this behavior is quite rational: Since you refuse to let me pass on my assets to my children, I'll spend them."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It is this kind of behavior that also helps explain why the estate tax acts as a drag on the economy, Beach says. The more individuals spend and consume, the less they save and invest. What's more, to the degree that individuals do continue to save and invest, they demand higher returns [interest rates] to offset the steep future tax they will pay. This raises the cost of capital to businesses, Beach says, which translates into lower levels of investment in plant and equipment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Perhaps most perniciously, the estate tax also hurts small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. Women re-entering the work force often find starting their own business the best economic opportunity, and minorities view businesses as a way to establish economic independence and give their children a boost up the economic ladder, Beach says. But businesses also constitute estates, raising the prospect that all the financial security these small-business owners have worked to achieve will evaporate once the owner dies. In fact, a 1995 survey highlighted by Beach showed that 58 percent of minority business owners believe their business will fail or have difficulty surviving after estate taxes kick in. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, there are approximately 16 million non-corporate family-owned businesses nationwide that may be affected by the estate tax. California, for example, has approximately 2.2 million; New York, 950,000; Texas, 1.6 million; Florida, 835,000; Illinois, 620,000; and Alabama, 208,000. In many cases, Beach says, these businesses won't survive the estate tax. The child who inherits the business will face such a crushing tax bill that the only viable option will be to sell it.<p>
<b>Repeal Would Boost Economy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In addition to chronicling the problems with the estate tax, Beach also asks what would happen to economic growth if it were repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Using two respected computer models of the U.S. economy -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 model by the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) -- he found that repeal would cause the economy to grow by an extra $3 billion (WEFA) to $11 billion (WUMM) per year between 1997 and 2005.  This translates into job growth over the same period of between 130,000 (WEFA) and 145,000 (WUMM). Using the WUMM model, Beach also estimates that repeal would boost household disposable income by $12 billion over the nine-year period; generate 49,000 new housing starts in its first year; and lower the cost of capital to business by at least two-tenths of a percent. "These numbers aren't huge," Beach says, "but they also are low-ball estimates. It may be that repealing the estate tax would produce much higher economic growth."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"In the end," Beach says, "the estate tax fails the cost-benefit test. Both the social and economic costs of the tax far exceed the revenue it produces for the government. If it were repealed, no one would miss it."

<title> Legislation Creating New Urban Policy Would Revive Poor Areas, Analysts Say - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> LEGISLATION CREATING NEW URBAN POLICY WOULD REVIVE POOR AREAS, ANALYSTS SAY
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 31, 1996</b> -- Congress is holding hearings this week on the American Community Renewal Act, a comprehensive bill to bring economic and moral renewal to the nation's most impoverished areas. A new <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib228.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> of the bill calls it "an excellent opportunity" to reverse 30 years of failed social policy.
<p>
	While the separate welfare reform legislation moving through Congress represents a step in the right direction, it omits many of the policy changes needed to aid the urban poor, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector. By providing tax and regulatory relief to economically depressed areas and by boosting the role religious institutions can play in addressing social ills, the American Community Renewal Act would do much more to help the poor overcome the poverty, drug abuse, family disintegration and crime that plague their communities, according to study authors Rector and Policy Analyst Christine Olson.
<p>
	Sponsored by Reps. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., and Jim Talent, R-Mo., the legislation "rejects the premise that all that is needed for our poorest communities are larger government benefit checks," the analysts say. Specifically, the bill would make the following policy changes:  <ul>
	<p><li>Reduce regulations and eliminate capital-gains taxes on assets held in 100 "renewal communities" across the nation. Research has shown that reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in impoverished areas can reduce unemployment by a third or more, the analysts say.
	<p><li>Provide poor parents with education scholarships that can be used to send their children to any school -- public, private or religious. "Giving poor parents the same choice in education enjoyed by middle- and upper-class families would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education and reduce the rate of school failure," Rector and Olson say. And by allowing parents to send their children to religious schools, "the sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is not only the most important aspect of a child's education but critical to solving social problems," they say.
	<p><li>Allow religious organizations to use federal funds to perform social-service work such as drug treatment. The social-science research shows religiously based drug-treatment programs are more effective than strictly secular programs, the analysts say. By prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations that have a proven track record of successfully treating substance abusers, Rector and Olson say, the bill would make the most of an underused solution to one of  the country's most pressing social problems.
	<p><li>Create a new charitable tax credit for donations given to charities whose primary purpose is to help the poor. "The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers are better able to decide where funds should go in their local communities than are bureaucrats in Washington," the analysts say. "The bill would encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social-service programs to help the poor."
	</ul><p>The American Community Renewal Act "gives Congress and the administration an opportunity to change the way the federal government has practiced community development for 30 years," the analysts say. "It respects the fact that low-income Americans want to help themselves, it builds on the successes of local organizations and community groups, and it harnesses the energy of the nation's churches and religious organizations in combating social ills."

<h2> TAKE GDP GROWTH NUMBERS WITH A GRAIN
OF SALT, HERITAGE ECONOMIST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 30, 1996</b> -- If history is any guide, the federal government's Aug. 1 estimate of how fast the economy grew in the second quarter of 1996 will be like most quarterly growth estimates of the past 20 years -- wrong. Probably very wrong.
<p>	According to a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi114.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the Commerce Department's regular quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP), the figures released by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have been off by an average of 50 percent during the nearly 20-year period beginning in 1976.
<p>	In some cases, the BEA couldn't even accurately say whether the economy had grown or contracted, economist William Beach found. From 1978 to 1991, for example, the BEA had to revise its numbers for 12 percent of all quarters to show that a "shrinking" economy had actually grown or that a "growing" economy had actually shrunk.
<p>	Citing the real effect the BEA's initial GDP forecasts can have on business decisions, Beach, the former chief economist for Sprint Corp., urges that the agency delay the release of growth numbers for at least 60 days, when fuller data will yield a more accurate picture of the economy.  "The federal government is forcing businesses to make decisions about jobs and investment based on faulty estimates of the economy's strength," he says. "In this regard, the GDP forecasts do more harm than good."
	<p>Frequently, the difference between the Commerce Department initial GDP estimates and the actual performance of the economy is extraordinary. For the first quarter of 1996, for example, the BEA initially said the economy grew by 2.8 percent.  Later revisions, however, put first quarter GDP growth at only 2.2 percent, a 20 percent downward revision.  More glaring was the error for the first quarter of 1992.  The BEA initially reported 2.0 percent growth, when later revisions showed the economy had grown 4.7 percent -- a 135 percent correction. 
	<p>The Heritage Foundation analysis found that the BEA underestimated the growth rate during President Reagan's two terms 63 percent of the time, while it has overestimated the growth rate 70 percent of the time during President Clinton's presidency.
	<p>Beach, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in political economy, does not fault the BEA. After all, he says, estimating quarterly GDP for the huge and highly complex U.S. economy will inevitably require "guesswork." What he does fault is the near-obsessive focus on quarterly GDP by politicians and the media, since the numbers tell so little about the actual strength of the economy. 
	<p>To get an accurate picture of the nation's economic health, he says, it is necessary to look at longer-term economic trends.
<p>	The GDP estimate for the second quarter of 1996, for example, may look good on paper, he says, but will mask the underlying economic trend -- which is downward. Beach notes that economic growth rates increased significantly from the first quarter of 1992 to the final quarter of 1994, but have been on a decline ever since. The fact that both the expansion and the slowdown have been punctuated by "spikes" in individual quarters does nothing to change the overall trend, he says.
<p>	The lesson? "Americans shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of economic prosperity, or insecurity, based on how the economy is supposedly performing during a single quarter," Beach says. "They also shouldn't be fooled by the political posturing that surrounds economic growth numbers. What counts is the longer term direction of the economy, and right now it's down."

<h2> CREDIT GOES TO CONGRESS FOR LOWER DEFICIT, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>

	WASHINGTON, JULY 26, 1996</b> -- If Congress hadn't stopped President Clinton from passing his 1996 budget, rejected his plans for $200 billion deficits well into the next century, and pushed through substantial cuts of its own, this year's deficit would be nowhere near the $117 billion recently projected  by the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113.html">according to Heritage Foundation budget analyst Scott Hodge</a>, the deficit would have come in at about what the Clinton administration originally proposed for 1996: a deficit of $211 billion.
<p>
	"It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting President Clinton's proposed deficit nearly in half," Hodge says. "Furthermore, had the president not vetoed Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for fiscal year 1996, this year's deficit would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which he now claims credit."
<p>
	Hodge says the domestic discretionary spending cutbacks pushed through by Congress in the face of White House opposition have gone practically unreported in accounts of the 104th Congress' legislative record. "Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, fiscal year 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969," he points out. "More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third."
<p>
	Other reasons cited by Hodge for the lower projected 1996 deficit numbers include:<ul>
	<p><li>The savings and loan bailout, which is now generating revenue instead of adding to the deficit. "This program -- which has accounted for 10 percent of the deficit change between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 -- is expected to bring in more than $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector";
	<p><li>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum. "President Clinton is reaping a windfall from the auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry, estimated to generate more than $10 billion in new revenues for fiscal year 1996";
	<p><li>A one-time tax revenue windfall caused by "investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax";
</ul><p>	"At every turn, the Clinton administration has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the rate of spending growth," Hodge says. "Incredibly, the president now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it was Congress that kept the president from pushing through spending that would have kept deficits higher than $200 billion for the foreseeable future."

<h2> GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF PARENTAL RIGHTS
ALL TOO COMMON, HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>

WASHINGTON, JULY 23, 1996</b> -- Legislation moving through Congress would protect parents from a growing number of government attempts to prevent them from raising their children as they see fit, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib227.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	With "parental rights" under siege on all fronts -- from legislatures, courts, government agencies, even the "helping" professions -- the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act" would restore to parents what the Supreme Court has deemed their "fundamental right" to direct the upbringing of their children, say study authors Patrick Fagan, Heritage's William FitzGerald fellow in family and cultural studies, and Wade Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative. Fagan is former deputy assistant secretary for social services policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Horn is former U.S. Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families.
<p>	To underscore the deteriorating status of parental rights -- and the need for legislation to correct the problem -- Fagan and Horn point to a number of recent abuses:<ul>
	<p><li>Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., tried in 1994 to require parents who educate their children at home to obtain state teacher certification, a step that would have all but abolished a practice already recognized as a parental right;
	<p><li>The Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1995 ruled that local school boards could deny parents the right to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distributions for their children;
	<p><li>The Michigan Supreme Court in 1993 denied "secular parents" the right to educate their children at home, even though it upheld the right of "religious parents" to do so;
	<p><li>The county of Durham, N.C., in 1995 drew up guidelines for determining the presence of child abuse in the home that could lead to investigations of parents for practices such as confining children to their rooms. The county also crafted a list of guidelines for "suitable" parenting, which included dictating such minutiae as what time parents must be home if a baby-sitter is watching their children (9 p.m. in the case of 12-14 year olds, for example);
	<p><li>A school nurse and doctor in East Stroudsburg, Penn., recently administered physical examinations -- including examination of the genitalia -- to about 60 girls aged 11 and 12, without permission from many of their parents; and
	<p><li>Even groups like school counselors and the American Library Association (ALA) have shown hostility toward parental rights; counselors by claiming they can counsel minors without parental consent, and the ALA by opposing parental efforts to prevent their children from checking out R- and X-Rated videos.
	</ul><p>Fagan and Horn say that even though the Supreme Court has ruled decisively in favor of parental rights, violations of those rights still occur with alarming frequency. To correct the problem, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.) would buttress the Court's settled opinion by clarifying parental rights to:<ul>
	<p><li>direct or provide for the education of the child;
	<p><li>make a health or mental-health decision for the child (with exceptions to "prevent an imminent risk of serious harm or remedy serious harm to the child");
	<p><li>discipline the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as defined by the Supreme Court; and 
	<p><li>direct or provide for the religious and moral formation of the child.
	</ul><p>The analysts are careful to point out that the legislation would in no way hinder states from protecting children from child abuse. Parental rights are fundamental, but they are not absolute, the analysts say. "No parent has a right to abuse a child," they say, "and the state has the duty to protect the child." The analysts say the real threat of child abuse stems not from the legislation, but from the "family preservation philosophy" of social workers who repeatedly try to reunite children with clearly abusive parents.
<p>	To those opponents of parental rights who will nevertheless raise the child-abuse issue, the analysts again cite the Supreme Court, which said in 1979 that "the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." 
	<p>It is this "repugnant" disregard for parental rights that must be corrected, the analysts say. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would do just that, they say, "erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights."

<title> Study Shows Wasteful Spending Still Abounds In Washington - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> STUDY SHOWS WASTEFUL SPENDING
STILL ABOUNDS IN WASHINGTON

        WASHINGTON, JULY 22, 1996</b> -- Even in an era marked by concern for how taxpayer dollars are spent, boondoggles still abound in Washington, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi112.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	In the second of a series of reports on "How Government Wastes Your Money," Heritage Senior Fellow in Economics Ronald Utt casts the spotlight on some particularly outlandish recent examples, such as:<ul>
<p><li>The 260 public housing residents, officials and employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who took an all-expenses-paid trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- courtesy of the taxpayers. The official purpose of the trip was to attend the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization. But HUD's inspector general said the event showed a marked "lack of programmatic content." Perhaps, says Utt, that's because the participants were too busy taking advantage of the numerous amenities offered at the Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort: gambling, snorkeling, dancing, touring, shopping and a beauty salon. The total cost of the excursion: $325,000.
<p><li>The telephones at the Department of Agriculture, which were being used to make calls to adult phone-sex lines, many to the Dominican Republic. What's more, the General Accounting Office found that during one four-month period roughly half the collect calls accepted by department employees (nearly 600 calls costing $2,600) were from inmates at 18 jails and prisons, with many of the calls rerouted illegally to the department's long-distance lines. 
<p><li>The decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to install a sophisticated new radar system at 47 airports at a cost of $373 million. The problem: The system doesn't work very well. At the 16 airports where it is already in place, the system has suffered frequent shutdowns. Since it was installed at Washington's National Airport in January 1996, for example, the system has failed nearly once every week and has proven incapable of detecting dangerous wind conditions (as it was supposed to).
	 </ul><p>"Washington would like to think these stories are isolated incidents," Utt concludes, "but they happen every day. It's just too easy to spend -- and misspend -- somebody else's money."

<title> AFL-CIO "Voter Education Project" Violates Worker Rights, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> AFL-CIO "VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT" VIOLATES WORKER RIGHTS, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1996</b> --  The AFL-CIO's $35 million "voter education project" violates the rights of union workers by using their mandatory union dues to pay for political activities aimed at defeating Republican members of the 104th Congress, two <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1087.html">Heritage Foundation analysts said today.</a>
	<p>They called on Congress to allow union workers to choose not to have their mandatory dues used for partisan political activities. A bill to accomplish this, The Worker Right to Know Act, is scheduled for a vote in Congress July 24 or soon thereafter.
	<p>According to Kenneth R. Weinstein, director of the think tank's Government Reform Project and Research Assistant Thomas M. Wielgus, union members split their vote roughly 60-to-40 between Democrats and Republicans, respectively, in 1994. Since virtually all of the AFL-CIO's effort is aimed at unseating Republicans, this means as many as 40 percent of  AFL-CIO members may be forced to finance political activities with which they disagree. 
	<p>"Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 per year per union member," Weinstein and Wielgus estimate. As things now stand, the authors note, unions are not required to account for how much of union dues are used for political versus other activities. Some unions don't even fully report the amount of their dues income to the government, they say.
<p>	What's more, Weinstein and Wielgus say "most union members may not realize that under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Communications Workers of America v. Beck they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree." 
	<p>Under the Beck decision, unions must refund to their members any dues not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration and grievance processes. Unfortunately, the Heritage analysts say, this decision remains largely unenforced. An April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain such a refund, and that once they realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund. 
	<p>To rectify the situation, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., has introduced the Worker Right To Know Act, which would require a union to obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and that used for other activities such as "voter education." It also would make it clear that if workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to political activities, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
	<p>"It is time to make workers aware of their rights under the applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely," the Heritage analysts say. "The Worker Right to Know Act would give union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes."

<h2> HISTORY SHOWS TAX CUTS BOOST ECONOMY, RAISE REVENUE, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 18, 1996</b> -- With the 1996 presidential campaign rekindling the debate over taxes, a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says tax rate reductions historically have had none of the negative consequences ascribed to them by tax-cut opponents.
<p>
	Daniel Mitchell, Heritage's McKenna senior fellow in political economy, examined the three major periods of tax-rate reductions in U.S. history -- the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s -- and found in each case that lower taxes not only boosted economic growth, but yielded the federal government more revenue and resulted in high-income Americans bearing a larger share of the tax burden. Consider:<ul>
	<p><li>In the 1920s, tax rates fell across the board, dropping from a top rate of 71 percent to 24 percent. As a result, the economy grew by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, government revenue from personal income taxes increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.2 billion in 1928, and the share of the tax burden borne by the rich ($50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. 
	<p><li>In the 1960s, President Kennedy again lowered tax rates across the board, reducing the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. In response, the economy experienced its longest expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, and tax collections from those making more than $50,000 climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966.
	<p><li>In the 1980s, President Reagan signed across-the-board tax cuts, paring the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. From 1982 to 1989, the economy responded with its longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew by 99.4 percent, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners rose from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988</ul>.
	<p>By contrast, Mitchell says, periods of tax increases have had a damaging effect on the economy.  He notes that since Reagan left office, the top tax rate has risen from 28 percent to 42 percent. The result: The economy has suffered its worst seven-year period of economic growth since World War II, with family income $2,000 lower today than it was in 1989. 
	<p>Likewise, tax increases imposed by President Johnson, combined with the "bracket creep" of the 1970s, caused the growing economy of the Kennedy years to lapse into a period of stagflation, notorious for rampant inflation and anemic economic growth. As for the 1920s tax cuts, they were followed in the 1930s by tax increases that boosted the top rate first to 63 percent, then to 79 percent. "To put it mildly," Mitchell says, "the 1930s are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades."
	<p>"The economy is lagging, incomes are falling, and tax revenues are stagnant," Mitchell says. "History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates."

<p>

        WASHINGTON, July 11, 1996</b> -- Dispatches from the front line of the war on drugs carry bleak news: The United States is going down to defeat, in no small part because the Clinton administration has failed to make combating drugs a high priority, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup279.html"> study released today.</a>
<p>
"After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush administrations, almost every available indicator shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs," say study authors John Walters and James O'Gara, respectively the president and director of research for the New Citizenship Project. Walters previously served as deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
	<p>Specifically, the analysts fault the president for lackluster appointments to key anti-drug positions, from the "invisible" former drug czar Lee Brown to the "embarrassing" former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who favored outright legalization of drugs. In addition, the administration has cut staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 and allowed 227 agent positions at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to disappear from September 1992 to September 1995.
	<p>Efforts to interdict drugs before they reach U.S. shores also have lagged under the Clinton administration, Walters and O'Gara say. All told, interdiction flight hours in the "transit zone" between the United States and South America have dropped by 50 percent, and ship "steaming days" have fallen by a third. 
	<p>These actions reflect the administration's intentional shift in strategy away from drug interdiction and law enforcement toward therapeutic treatment of drug users, the analysts say. But the new policy has a price: Almost as soon as it went into effect, cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard plummeted, from 51 metric tons in fiscal 1993 to 15 metric tons in fiscal 1994. During the same period, the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104, which, ironically, coincided with increased drug use among the very hard-core addicts the administration's new policy was supposed to help.
	<p>The result: Hard-core drug users are "cycling through emergency rooms at record rates," Walters and O'Gara say. Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the first half of 1995 were 65 percent higher than in the first half of 1991; for heroin, the figure was 120 percent higher; and for methamphetimine the figure was an astonishing 321 percent higher.
	<p>Perhaps even more distressing, the spike in drug use under the Clinton administration is not limited to addicts and "hard" drugs. Citing research from the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Michigan, Walters and O'Gara note that the number of kids age 12 to 17 using marijuana has almost doubled since 1992, from 1.6 million to 2.9 million. Nearly one in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 12 percent of the class of 1995 had taken LSD. 
	<p>Given the administration's record, Walters and O'Gara say the appointment of Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar is a step in the right direction but that much more needs to be done if the president hopes to retake lost ground in the war on drugs. Specifically, he should:<ul>
	<p><li>Use the "bully pulpit" to send a powerful anti-drug message to the nation's youth, something he thus far has failed to do;
	<p><li>Support anti-drug efforts in Latin America. For $50 million, for example, the administration could provide new tracking aircraft to Peru, a country that has proven its commitment to fighting the drug war by shooting down or disabling 20 trafficker airplanes since March of 1995;
	<p><li>Permit the Defense Department to spend more than the currently allowed 0.3 percent of its budget on drug interdiction;
	<p><li>Block future proposals by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to ease prison sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine; and
	<p><li>Allow federal funds to flow to religiously based drug-treatment programs, which in some cases are far more effective than programs where addicts decide how long and rigorous their treatment will be. 
	</ul><p>In the end, Walters and O'Gara say the Clinton administration cannot escape at least partial responsibility for America's recent losses in the war on drugs. "President Clinton has demonstrated little leadership on the drug issue and has failed to send an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans," they say.

<h2> AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL
TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT, STUDY SAYS
</h2>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 18, 1996</b> -- The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110.html">a new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.
	<p>As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits. To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, says <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm"> Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies.
	<p>The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse. Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent). Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent. With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
	<p>Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition, Butler says.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is "allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years," the Heritage Foundation executive says. By that point, "the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic," he says.
	<p>Butler says Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program.  First, turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  Second, allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  And third, reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.
	<p>Calling the Medicare Trustees report "grim reading," Butler says policy-makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms. "Only the third choice makes any sense," Butler says. "The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be."

<h2> REPUBLICANS WRONG TO BELIEVE 104th CONGRESS A FAILURE, ANALYST SAYS </h2>
<p><b>Bigger Budget Cuts than Reagan's</b>
</center>
<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 14, 1996</b> -- It's one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it's quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109.html"> a new Heritage Foundation analysis.</a><p>
	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ron Utt</a>.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  <p>
	"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war." 
	<p>Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.
	<p>Utt's conclusion: Congress' accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency's budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan's goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress' 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.
	<p>Granted, there's much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress' performance was," Utt says, "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress' cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country's four "power marketing administrations."
	<p>With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress' goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There's no reason it can't cut spending a second time." <p>

<title>INS Considers "Dumbing Down" Standards for Citizenship, Analyst Charges - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> INS CONSIDERS "DUMBING DOWN" STANDARDS FOR CITIZENSHIP, ANALYST CHARGES </h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 13, 1996</b> -- This Fourth of July, 2,000 immigrants will swear-in as U.S. citizens at the World Trade Center in New York City, 10,000 will naturalize in Los Angeles a day earlier, and another 4,000 will swap their green cards for citizenship papers in El Paso, Texas.
	<p>Like the waves of immigrants that rolled upon America's shores on the eve of World War I, these immigrants have been immersed in the language, culture and history of their new nation, the better to help them become naturalized U.S. citizens. Now, proposals under consideration by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would tamper with this highly successful assimilation formula, lowering naturalization standards and devaluing citizenship "like a worthless peso," according to a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/miller.html">new article</a> in The Heritage Foundation magazine <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.</a> 
	<p>Specifically, the INS is considering making it easier -- too easy -- to become a U.S. citizen, writes John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. Not only is the INS studying whether to ease the English language requirement for citizenship, it is contemplating exempting entire classes of immigrants from the U.S. history and government tests newcomers traditionally have to pass. 
	<p>Granted, the INS has had to deal with a flood of new applications for citizenship -- 1.2 million in 1995 versus an average of just 230,000 a year in the 1980s.  But the way to cope with the volume of applications is not to lower naturalization standards to the point that immigrants begin to take citizenship for granted, Miller says.  
	<p>Yet that, he says, is what is happening. "Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates," he says.
	<p>To some organizations, this is a welcome development, because easy naturalization translates into political power. For example, Miller says, more Hispanic citizens means more Hispanic votes, which explains why the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials promotes easing naturalization standards. 
	<p>But such views not only diminish the value of citizenship, Miller says, they may also inflame the anti-immigrant sentiment that bubbles just below America's multicultural surface.  Citing a recent poll that shows 66 percent of Americans already feel America is no longer a "melting pot," Miller says a robust naturalization process is the only means the country has to "decide who is an American and who is not ... Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations." 
	<p>Fortunately, Miller says, an antidote to the INS's lackadaisical attitude toward naturalization can be found in a Seattle program that puts immigrants through an intensive, 10-week course in the basics of U.S. citizenship.  Applicants who pass an English fluency screening are grilled in preparation for the standard INS exam, and are rewarded with an INS interview at the end of 10 weeks, compared to the usual six-month wait.  Particularly encouraging to Miller is the fact that the Seattle program -- which requires immigrants to give up three hours a night, four nights a week -- has a waiting list hundreds of names long.
	<p>Miller concedes the INS lacks the resources to run such a program itself, but then he doesn't want it to. Instead, he envisions a nationwide network of private and local public institutions that "would revive the old-fashioned idea of civic instruction for immigrant adults."  In this way, he says, immigrants can become Americans, and America can remain the melting pot it was intended to be. <p>

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEARS BRUNT
OF GOVERNMENT "DOWNSIZING"
</h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 29, 1996</b> --As Congress and the White House lock horns over the fiscal 1997 budget, both sides should take note of an important fact:  Most of the government downsizing that has occurred so far has been in the Department of Defense. 
	<p>In fact, of the 200,000 government jobs eliminated to date, some 60 percent have been defense jobs. If one counts all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of fiscal year 1992, more than 89 percent  -- almost 760,000 total -- come solely from the Department of Defense, according to Heritage Foundation Senior Defense Policy Analyst Baker Spring and Policy Analyst  John S. Barry, authors of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bgup278.html">a study released today.</a>
<p>	Defense budget cuts, in turn, have led to a drop in private-sector defense industry jobs, according to Spring and Barry. By the end of fiscal year 1997, there will be 795,000 fewer such positions than in 1992. "In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. By comparison, Internal Revenue Service employment has dropped by only 6 percent, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] positions have dropped by less than 5 percent and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] positions have increased by more than 2 percent," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>Barry and Spring recommend "restoring balance" to federal employment policy by:<ul>
<li>Freezing military personnel reductions at 2.4 million, the level recommended by the Clinton administration in its 1993 "Bottom Up Review" of U.S. military requirements
<li>Limiting further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts
<li>Increasing a defense procurement budget that has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985, severely damaging America's future military readiness. The steady stream of procurement cuts have cost 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the defense employment peak in 1987
<li>Concentrating federal work force reductions within non-defense departments by eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies.</ul>
	<p>"President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA and ATF watching their every move. They do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War," write Spring and Barry.

<title>Legal-Aid Groups Defy Ban on Lobbying and Helping Criminals, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

LEGAL-AID GROUPS DEFY BAN ON LOBBYING
AND HELPING CRIMINALS, STUDY SAYS  </h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 21, 1996</b> -- Faced with new rules that prevent them from lobbying and defending drug dealers and illegal aliens, groups that use taxpayer dollars to provide legal assistance to the poor have devised a number of loopholes allowing them to continue these banned activities, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html">according to a new report</a> from The Heritage Foundation.
	<p>Rules imposed by Congress last year bar groups that receive grants from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from using any part of their budget -- including private funds -- to lobby against welfare reform, file class-action lawsuits, represent criminals, and engage in other politically motivated activities. The new rules were necessary, says Kenneth Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center and author of the report, because "in the past legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, their own money for prohibited activities."  
<p>	But with this loophole now closed, Boehm says, legal services groups have invented a new evasive tactic: They swear off banned activities in order to remain eligible for federal money, then set up new shadow organizations that will use the groups' non-federal money to pursue a political agenda.  
<p>	For example, the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center was recently formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services (CLS), which receives money from the LSC. The new center, housed in the same building as CLS, will handle non-prohibited cases and receive taxpayer subsidies; CLS, meanwhile, will continue to handle prohibited political and ideological cases. "The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused," Boehm says.
<p>	Legal services lawyers also have incurred the wrath of Congress for representing drug dealers who face eviction from public housing projects. Boehm cites a case pending in New York City where representatives of the city's 500,000 public housing tenants have sided with the New York Housing Authority in support of expedited evictions of drug dealers. Defending the drug dealers is the Legal Aid Society, which is supposed to use the federal money it receives from the LSC to represent the interests of the poor. 
<p>	With Congress likely to impose a new round of tough restrictions to deal with this problem, the LSC board defensively drafted a new regulation that supposedly bans legal groups receiving federal funds from representing drug dealers facing eviction, Boehm says. The problem, once again, is that the regulation is so full of loopholes it does nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from participating in drug-eviction cases, he says.
<p>	The ability of legal services groups to flout attempts to rein in their political activities is evidence to Boehm that Congress was right last year when it decided to end all federal funding for the LSC by 1998. Besides, he notes, the LSC has been successful raising funds for its activities from other sources, blunting the charge that elimination of federal funding would deny legal services to the poor. For example, the LSC will receive $278 million from the federal government this year, down from $400 million last year, a substantial cut. Yet the LSC also collects $250 million a year from non-federal sources, Boehm says, raising the question of whether federal funding is needed in the first place.
<p>	When the bill that funds the LSC for fiscal year 1997 comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is expected to leave open the option of "zeroing out" the agency -- something Boehm says would be a wise policy decision. "The 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of legal services groups to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense," Boehm says. Now, he says, "it is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program."

Ever-Increasing "Tax Wedge" 
Between Labor Costs And Wages

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 17, 1996</b> -- Instead of increasing the minimum wage, which would only destroy jobs, lawmakers addressing worker anxiety over lower take-home pay should reduce the costs imposed by government on employers, Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi102.html">said today</a>.
<p>	"There is a huge 'wedge' between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck," according to Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, deputy director for economic policy. "These costs are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess consumes their take-home pay."
<p>	For example, the analysts point out that in 1995 private-industry employers paid an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep a worker on their payrolls. But after deducting the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes and optional benefits, workers took home an average of only $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less that the total cost of employing them. "The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation," the analysts say.
<p>	For minimum-wage workers, the "wedge" is just as bad: In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire such a worker. But after the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03 per hour) is deducted, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, this worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total cost of their employment, and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>	These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study cited by the analysts estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per year. "This equals somewhere between $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker," the analysts say.
<p>	"The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage," say Wilson and Antonelli. Instead, "Government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay." Such policies -- cuts in payroll and income taxes, reductions in the regulatory burden on businesses, a cut in the capital gains tax -- also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities and real earnings.	  
<p>	"Politicians who blame 'corporate greed' for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government," the Heritage analysts say.

Congress, White House
Urged to Boost Spending

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 16, 1996</b> -- The refusal of the White House to adequately fund its own national security programs is undermining America's ability to guarantee victory in defense of its freedom and global interests, a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says.
<P>	Even the passage by the House yesterday of a defense budget $12 billion higher than what President Clinton has requested for fiscal year 1997 is not enough, not when the White House has underfunded its own military strategy by $130 billion over the next six years, Heritage Senior Policy analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> calculates. The Senate, Spring says, has an opportunity to begin to correct the administration's grave funding shortfall when it considers the fiscal 1997 Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>	Spring says the existing gap between what is needed to fund the administration's military strategy -- which calls for the United States to be able to fight two Persian Gulf-sized wars "nearly simultaneously" -- and actual spending plans will leave the United States unable to fulfill its commitment to security alliances in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  He estimates that under the president's defense budget fighting just one Persian Gulf-sized war in the future would require 87 percent of America's army divisions and 75 percent of its aircraft-carrier battle groups, leaving little left to fight a second conflict and uphold security commitments.
<p>	While Congress has attempted to provide adequate funding for the administration's defense plan in the short term, it has failed to address the long-term implications of the budget shortfall on U.S. military strategy, Spring says.  Despite the House-approved increase in defense spending for the coming fiscal year, Congress' overall defense budget actually would spend less than what the White House proposes in 2001 and 2002, he says.  Even last year's decision by Congress to spend $7 billion more on defense than the White House, while politically costly, fell far short of the $20 billion Spring says is necessary to fully fund the administration's defense plan.
<p>	By way of example, Spring notes that Operation Desert Storm required seven active army divisions and six aircraft-carrier battle groups.  Yet the administration's defense budget, Spring estimates, provides for only eight of each.  The result: If a U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf were attacked by either Iran or Iraq, the United States could respond but could not also maintain its commitments elsewhere in the world.
<p>	Although critics claim reductions in military spending are only natural now that the Cold War is over, Spring notes that those reductions are being made without regard for the fact that U.S. security commitments to NATO, Japan and others remain intact.  "All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services," he says.  Without increased defense spending, up to the level needed to fund the administration's military strategy, "the time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments." 
<p>	The task for Congress, Spring says, is to begin a national debate over the proper role and size of America's defense forces.  To stimulate such a debate, Spring offers a draft resolution that Congress could consider, outlining in detail a global defense strategy and the specific force levels necessary to fulfill that strategy -- down to the number of troops, ships and aircraft required.  The resolution could be considered as an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill, he says.  
<p>	But the time to begin the debate is now, Spring says, for if defense spending is left at current levels it could well mean "the end of America as a global military power ... and the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort Americans have not known since the first half of this century."

<title>Foreign Aid Recipients Consistently Vote Against U.S. in U.N. - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FOREIGN AID RECIPIENTS CONSISTENTLY VOTE AGAINST THE U.S. IN THE U.N., STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1996</b> -- Despite claims by the Clinton administration that foreign aid bolsters support for America around the globe, nearly two-thirds of the countries that received U.S. foreign aid last year voted against the United States a majority of the time in the United Nations, according to a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi101.html">new analysis</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	All told, 75 of the 118 countries that received foreign aid last year voted against the United States more than half of the time, reports Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a>. "It's clear from the data," he says, "that foreign aid fails to win friends where it counts -- in supporting U.S. diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations."
<p>	The 10 countries that voted against the United States most often -- an average of 73 percent of the time -- will pocket more than $212 million in foreign aid this fiscal year. And of the 10 countries that will receive the most money, only three of them voted with the United States a majority of the time.
<p>	Some of America's biggest aid beneficiaries were consistently hostile to U.S. positions in the United Nations. Egypt, for example, receives more foreign aid ($2.1 billion) than any country except Israel, yet voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. And the country that voted against the United States the most -- India, 83 percent of the time -- is America's fifth-largest foreign aid recipient, pulling in $157 million.
<p>	Even Haiti and Mexico, two countries the United States has helped considerably, consistently opposed U.S. positions in the United Nations. On top of the $1 billion America spent on a military operation to restore democracy to Haiti, the island nation will get another $124 million this year. Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the time. The same holds true of Mexico, which benefited from a $40 billion economic bailout funded largely by U.S. taxpayers and is slated to get another $25 million this year, yet voted against the United States 58 percent of the time.
<p>	"Why is the United states spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?" Johnson asks. He recommends that Congress make significant cuts in the $13 billion foreign aid budget this year, even abolishing the agency that hands out most of the money.

<title>Congress Should Back White House Plan to Let Poor Move Out of Public Housing - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>CONGRESS SHOULD BACK WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO LET POOR MOVE OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING, ANALYST SAYS</h2>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 7, 1996</b> -- Congress should end antiquated housing policies that concentrate the poor in deteriorating neighborhoods and embrace a Clinton administration plan that gives tenants a choice of where to live, a Heritage Foundation analyst says in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1081.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	"To his credit, President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from projects to tenant-based vouchers that let the poor rent the housing of their choice," says Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow at the prominent think tank.   
<p>	Yet rather than embrace what Utt calls the most innovative housing-reform proposal in 25 years, Congress drafted new legislation that largely preserves the current system of public-housing projects. While such a move is sure to please the construction and public-housing lobbies, he says, it guarantees that thousands of poor families will remain trapped in substandard government apartments.
<p>	Under the president's plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would end multibillion-dollar payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with vouchers going directly to tenants living in housing projects. Utt says tenants then would have a range of options: continue to rent housing from the PHA, rent better housing elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better project managers. The end result is that PHAs would be stripped of their government-sponsored monopoly and forced to compete for tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. 
<p>	But Congress is blocking the reform, Utt says, devoting much-needed funds to traditional public housing projects rather than to vouchers. For example, the $2.5 billion proposed by the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over HUD to modernize housing projects could have provided vouchers to more than 475,000 poor families. Another example: HUD plans to spend $115 million in Baltimore to construct just 338 new housing units, money that could provide a year's worth of safe, decent, privately-owned apartments to as many as 80 percent of the 25,000 poor families on the city's housing-assistance waiting list.
<p>	On average, Utt estimates, project-based assistance costs twice as much as vouchers for each family helped. Instead of empowering tenants, such an approach enriches local bureaucracies at the expense of both the poor and the taxpayers, he says.  
<P>	Vouchers, by contrast, would allow poor families to rent the housing of their choice, as long as the rent stays within established limits. "This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities," Utt says. "Families can move to safer neighborhoods with better schools, the unemployed can move where the jobs are, and the elderly can move closer to their families and shopping." 
<p>	"Congress needs to seriously reconsider its preservation of the status quo in public housing," Utt says. Project-based housing is a proven failure, he says, resulting in the warehousing of large concentrations of the poor in dismal neighborhoods marked by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect and other pathologies. Far better, he says, to switch to a voucher system giving the poor the freedom to live where they want.

<CENTER><B><h2>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES 1996 JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIPS</h2>
<h3>$50,000 GOLD AWARD AND $20,000 SILVER AWARD</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
Potomac, MD, May 7, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced the winners of its 1996 journalism fellowship awards.  Stacy Mattingly captured the $50,000 Gold Award for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi.  Daniel Richardson won the $20,000 silver award to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.  
<p>
Mattingly and Richardson were introduced during an awards dinner last night at the University Club in Washington, D.C., attended by prominent journalists.
<p>
During her one-year fellowship which commences on September 1, 1996, Stacy Mattingly will research and write a book on <I>Lisa Herdahl v. Pontotoc County</I>, a Mississippi school prayer case currently in the courts.  Last year, she wrote an extensive article on the case for <I>The Oxford American </I>magazine in Mississippi.  She has spent a great deal of time in Pontotoc County, and her article was widely praised as the most thorough and balanced reporting on the case.  She will write a book in narrative form, beginning with the Herdahl family's move 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi and ending with the trial on the school prayer case.
<p>
Mattingly, 25, is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta.  She writes articles for <I>Crisis</I> magazine and the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I>.  She served as contributing editor and writer for <I>The Oxford American</I> and as staff reporter for <I>The Oxford Eagle</I> newspaper.  She graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in English.
<p>
For his fellowship project, Daniel Richardson will focus on the Patriot movement in this country.  He believes the Patriot "subculture" is becoming too large to be ignored.  He will investigate the many groups which comprise the Patriot subculture, and he will examine the single defining thread running through all Patriot ideas:  the subversion of the Constitution by internal and external foes leading to greater government authority at the expense of individual freedoms.
<p>
Richardson, 23, is a freelance journalist in Gresham, Oregon.  He writes articles and news stories for <I>The Oregon City News</I> and <I>East County Magazine</I> in Gresham.  He graduated from the University of Puget Sound last year with a B.A. in History.  For his senior thesis, he wrote "A Military History of the Hundred Years' War."
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism.  The Foundation established its journalism fellowship program in 1994 to provide annual grants for journalism projects supportive of American culture and a free society.  The fellowship program is open to working journalists with less than five years of professional experience.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation served as judges for the competition.  The Trustees are:  Thomas L. Phillips, President of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.

Clear "Intervention Criteria" Needed
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 2, 1996</b> -- The United States has been squandering its limited military resources on "missions without a purpose" around the globe, making it difficult for American forces to keep up with their other security commitments, the Heritage Foundation's chief foreign policy spokesman said today.
<P>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a>, the think tank's vice president and director of foreign policy and defense studies, the Clinton White House desperately needs to formulate, spell out and "codify" a policy on where, when, and under what circumstances the United States will intervene militarily in the future.
<p>	Congress, meanwhile, should reassert its "oversight" responsibilities in this area, he said.
<p>
<b>Intervention Criteria</b>
<p>	Holmes made his remarks during a briefing on a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">policy paper</a> on American military intervention. Written by Defense Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a>, a decorated Gulf War veteran, the report says any U.S. decision to intervene militarily should be based on whether U.S. interests are at stake, America's ability to decisively affect the outcome, and the resources available for the task. 

<p>	Hillen proposes five criteria for determining whether and how the United States should intervene in any given situation:
<p>
<b>	1) Whether national security interests are at stake. </b>
<P>	The United States, Hillen says, must be able to distinguish between such vital interests as "protecting America's territory, borders and airspace" and other interests "that are merely important or marginal." Not all American interests are "high priority" national security interests that must be defended through military intervention, he stresses. 
<p>	The United States should always be prepared to use military force to defend its vital interests, Hillen says. But since U.S. military resources -- both tangible assets such as troops, carrier battle groups, fighter wings, and spare parts and equipment, and intangibles such as "public support" -- are available only in limited supply, the president must realize that not all interests are equally important and choose wisely where and when to dispatch U.S. troops.
<p>	America's vital interests, he says, include: protecting America's territory, borders and airspace; protecting American citizens at home and abroad; preventing a "major-power" threat to Europe, East Asia or the Persian Gulf; preventing "hostile interference by an outside power" in the Western Hemisphere; and ensuring access to foreign trade and resources.
<p><b>	2) Whether the proposed intervention will "jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet more important security commitments."</b>
<p>	There is "an enormous gap," Hillen says, between America's national commitments and objectives and the military resources available to achieve them. 
<p>	The administration's own proposed military force, (presented in the Pentagon's "Bottom-Up Review" of U.S. military readiness) is not only "inadequate" for America's stated strategy, but is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion over five years. Such a force, he says, simply can't do everything the administration expects it to do. 
<p>	"Military interventions in support of peripheral interests," he says, "should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests -- a perilous situation that many believe the United States is rapidly approaching today."
<p><b>	3) Whether the military goals are clearly defined, decisive, attainable and sustainable.</b>
<p>	Military objectives, Hillen stresses, should support political objectives. "For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from ... Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task ... the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored." 
<p>	While "working towards clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point," Hillen says, the Clinton administration has consistently done otherwise. Indeed, when U.S. troops were sent to Haiti and Bosnia, he notes, about the only goal the administration clearly articulated was "setting deadlines for troop withdrawals." This approach, he says, "is a gross misuse of American military power."
<p><b>	4) Whether Congress and the public support the action.</b>
<p>	As the Vietnam experience showed, "only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the United States hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad," Hillen cautions. In the absence of such support, the United States is forced into humiliating withdrawals like the Somalia debacle in 1994.
<p><b>	5) Whether the U.S. military can create "the conditions for their success" -- enabling U.S. forces to achieve their objectives.</b>
<p>	"This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just 'the big ones'," Hillen says. "Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli, Libya, can have a decisive effect." 
<p>	However, he warns, there is always the temptation in limited military interventions to greatly restrict the operational latitude and resources made available to the military command, "because the purpose of the intervention is to send an indeterminate political signal."
<p>	In any intervention, Hillen says, "the military must be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well trained, and that will make a difference, once attained."
<p>	"There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention," the Heritage Foundation report concludes. "However, by establishing workable criteria for military interventions, the United States can minimize those risks, or, at the very least, ensure that the risks are consistent with the costs of the intervention," Hillen says.

<head><title>1993 Tax Hike Dampening U.S. Economy - Heritage PR</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>Washington, D.C. 20002<br>(202 546-4400<br><p><hr><h2>1993 TAX HIKE DAMPENING U.S. ECONOMY,
NEW STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

		WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1996</b> -- Along with the recent news that the U.S. economy grew by only 0.5 percent during the final quarter of last year comes a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">new study</a> from The Heritage Foundation that helps explain why: the $241 billion tax hike enacted in 1993.
<p>		Employing one of the computer models of the economy used by the federal government and many leading U.S. corporations, Heritage Foundation economists found from 1993 through the end of 1996 the tax increase will cost the economy $208 billion in total output, reduce the number of new jobs by 1.2 million, and cost the typical family approximately $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings.
<p>		With economic security shaping up as a key issue in the 1996 elections, these findings shed light on the widely observed economic "anxiety" felt by many Americans, say study authors <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs, and <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, visiting fellow in tax analysis.  "People are right to feel they should be better off today than they are," the authors say.  "The 1993 tax increase deprived them of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth."
<p>		Heritage arrived at its findings by essentially "deleting" the tax and spending changes contained in Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) from the computer model -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM). This generates a simulation of how the economy would have performed if these factors had not been changed. No other variables were changed, and only mainstream economic assumptions were made where necessary.
<p>		In addition to slower growth and fewer new jobs, the Heritage analysis also indicated that employee wages and salaries will be reduced by $112 billion, automobile and light truck sales will fall short by 1.3 million vehicles, and businesses will invest some $42.5 billion less in durable goods.
<p>		Taking a specific year -- 1995 -- the study found that the economy would have grown by an additional $66 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were it not for the 1993 tax hike. And for the entire period between 1993 and 1996, the total loss in economic growth is an estimated $208 billion, or $2,100 for every household in America.  
<p>		As for the 1.2 million jobs not created as a result of the 1993 tax and budget changes, nearly 17 percent were the result of new businesses not formed. For every $1 billion in economic growth, roughly 195 new businesses are created.  This means the loss of $208 billion in GDP prevented nearly 40,600 businesses, and 203,000 jobs, from being created. The other 1 million missing jobs are likely the result of existing businesses hiring fewer employees due to the tax increase. Hodge and Beach say that although an otherwise healthy economy has created 8 million new jobs over the past three years, the fact remains that "1.2 million Americans who could have been working today are not because of the 1993 tax increase."
<p>		Not only are fewer Americans working than would have been, but those who are working are earning less.  Of the $112 billion in lower wages and salaries caused by OBRA-93, $46.5 billion will be lost in 1996 alone, according to the Heritage projection using the WUMM model.  That translates into roughly $465 for every household in America, more than the average U.S. household's monthly housing bill of $440.
<p>		Specific industries also are suffering from OBRA-93. In the automobile industry, for example, the loss of 368,000 vehicle sales in 1996 alone means $4.8 billion in lower revenue and 60,100 fewer jobs in auto-related fields.  And as for computers, more than one-third of the $42.5 billion shortfall in durable-goods purchases by businesses will be reflected in lost computer sales, the Heritage study indicates.
<p>		Far from being the healthiest economy in 30 years, as President Clinton has said, "the current economy is lousy compared to past recoveries and lousy compared to what it would have been without the 1993 tax increase," Beach says. "The first rules of economics should be the same as it is in medicine: First, do no harm."

   <h2>TAX LIMITATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT</h2>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> On April 15, the day Americans' increasingly burdensome tax bill is due, The House of Representatives will vote to make it harder to increase taxes in the future.  The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.159:">Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment</a> would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes rather than the fifty percent plus one currently required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"In 1950, families paid only 5 percent of their income in federal taxes," said Herger.  "In 1990, that number jumped to 24 percent and when combined with state and local taxes, families lose almost half their income to taxes.  If a two-thirds tax increase amendment had been in place since 1980, the American people would have been spared more than $660 billion in new taxes, all of which were used to pay for more government spending."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Over the past three decades, Washington has paid for wasteful and excessive federal spending by simply raising taxes on working families and small businesses," added Herger.  "These excessive taxes stifle business growth, hurt families, and hinder our nation's economy.  It shouldn't be easy to take money from families and businesses -- it's their money not Washington's."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"A two-thirds requirement to raise taxes would go a long way toward reining in runaway federal spending and putting a check on excessive taxation," said Herger.  "The requirement would also become a valued component in our efforts to reform the entire tax system."

<h2>DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN FORCES NEW U.S.-PRC-ROC STRATEGIC BALANCE, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 12, 1996</b> -- Taiwan's new democratic status will force the People's Republic of China (PRC) to treat her with much greater caution and respect, and U.S. policy-makers to take America's commitment to her safety more seriously, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a>, a policy analyst with Heritage's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, the new situation "forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance." For the United States, "democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking better relations with China." From now on, "U.S. policy-makers will be freer to stand up for Taiwan because they will more clearly occupy the moral high ground," Yates says, "whereas China will have to be more circumspect in its belligerence where Taiwan is concerned." In fact, he says, "Taiwanese democracy strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy." 
<p>
	"It will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese who elected him," Yates says. On a practical level, this means "if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative," the answer no longer can be "that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese." In fact, Yates says democracy on Taiwan "challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan."  
<p>	Meanwhile, "democracy is of great strategic importance to Taiwan -- more important than any weapon system it could acquire," Yates points out. "It makes the ROC much more likely to draw support from the United States and other developed democracies in the event of a hostile threat from mainland China."
<p>	Yates offers a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup272.html">game plan</a> U.S. policy-makers should follow to protect American interests in the Far East, and promote stability in the region. Among the proposals:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue, so that China and Taiwan have a forum to discuss and resolve issues;<p>
<li> Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank, even if the PRC objects;<p>
<li>	  In accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, continue to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, and assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile-defense system;<p>
	<li>  Avoid linking renewal of the PRC's most favored nation (MFN) trade status with Taiwan issues, since such linkage would be counterproductive and would probably hurt Taiwan and Hong Kong, which have manufacturing concerns on the mainland; and<p>
<li> Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement, perhaps one whereby Taiwan would pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time, and Beijing would agree to renounce the use of force during that same period.<p>
</ul>
	"The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy," Yates observes. "Despite large-scale military and rhetorical intimidation from Beijing, the election ran smoothly.  Now the United States, China and Taiwan must establish a new equilibrium that will be successful in the new strategic environment."

<h2>DESPITE VICTORIES, CONSERVATISM FACES TOUGH FIGHT, HERITAGE PRESIDENT SAYS</h2>
</center><b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 11, 1996</b> -- President Clinton's State of the Union pronouncement that "the era of big government is over" seemed to cement conservatism's position as the dominant political philosophy in America.  
<p>	Not so fast, says the president of The Heritage Foundation in his latest annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," released today. It's true conservatives have scored some important victories, but "the war is far from over," according to <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, head of the well-known conservative think tank.  
<p>	"Liberalism is not dead," Feulner says, "because it is just too much fun to spend other people's money." He notes that after President Clinton's eulogy for big government, one of his first actions was to demand $8 billion in new spending from Congress for the current fiscal year. 
<p>	What's more, he says, the Washington establishment's response to many of the proposals for conservative change has been a resounding "no": no term limits, no balanced budget, no welfare reform, no entitlement reform, no significant regulatory relief, and no end to the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services Corporation and numerous other non-essential programs and agencies.
<p>	While Feulner is not prepared to declare the end of liberalism as a political entity, neither does he agree with those "perpetually melancholy conservatives who subscribe to the headline 'We Lost.'" After all, he says, Congress passed both a bold, seven-year balanced budget plan and real welfare reform (both vetoed by President Clinton). And even in the face of threatened retaliation from the powerful senior-citizen lobby, Congress tried to reform Medicare -- a valiant effort that would have saved the program from impending bankruptcy.
<p>	Of course, Congress also committed its share of blunders in the past year, Feulner says. For example, lawmakers dallied on the passage of the line-item veto. "Without sounding too much like the liberal League of Women Voters or Common Cause," he says, "the line-item veto languished for 18 months because the GOP Congress didn't want to hand this weapon to President Clinton." Calling the veto central to getting control of the budget, Feulner says, "The credibility of all of us who truly believe in smaller, less intrusive government suffered while Congress dragged its feet on this promise." The legislation finally was approved this spring and signed into law on April 9.
<p>	Feulner also criticizes some of his fellow conservatives for their short-sightedness on tax reform. "Reforming the tax code to produce a flat -- or at least a flatter -- tax was to have been the driving issue in the '96 election," Feulner says. Instead, the GOP presidential hopefuls earlier this year used the issue to attack one another.  "What were these Republicans -- self-proclaimed conservatives all -- doing playing upon class warfare and class envy, positions long the domain of the left?" he asks.
<p>	Despite these short-term setbacks, the Heritage Foundation chief executive remains upbeat about the direction in which the country is moving politically. The reason: "Most Americans realize liberalism has been a failure." Citing a <I>Washington Post</I> series bemoaning the fact that many Americans have lost confidence in government, Feulner says, "Of course they have; any sane person would." After all, what other reaction can there be to stories like the one cited by Feulner on how Minnesota's Medicaid program is paying for sex-change operations?  Transsexuals may complain that they are "trapped" in the bodies of the opposite sex, he says, "but what about the average American who is trapped inside the body of a taxpayer?"
<p>	As long as such liberal excesses continue -- and there is no reason to believe they will cease -- Feulner believes the conservative case will remain as strong as ever. "I am optimistic," he says, "because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not on wishful thinking." 
<p>	"People genuinely want to get this country back on the right track," he says. "The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America."

<title>Heritage Offers Blueprint for Dismantling U.S. Department of Education - Heritage PR</title></head>

<h2>HERITAGE FOUNDATION OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR DISMANTLING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Heritage Public Relations<p>

	WASHINGTON, APRIL 5, 1996</b> -- Congress should take the funds now going to the U.S. Department of Education and send them back back to states, localities and parents, Heritage Foundation analysts said in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1076.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	To assist lawmakers in this task, the study's authors, Visiting Fellow in Education Denis Doyle and Policy Analyst Christine Olson, have put together a comprehensive plan that would eliminate many federal education programs outright, transfer some programs to other government agencies, and roll others into block grants to be administered by states and localities.
<p>	Doyle and Olson recommend a host of programs for termination, including Goals 2000, President Clinton's education reform initiative, the Bilingual and Immigrant Education program (to be phased out over three years), college Work-Study, and Direct Student Loans. Programs that would be transferred to other government agencies include student financial-aid, such as Pell Grants and Federal Perkins Loans. These would go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A host of programs are recommended for either full or partial conversion into state or local block grants, including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Title I, the federal aid program for school districts with high concentrations of poor students.  
<p>	Doyle and Olson say the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, sponsored by Reps. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., and Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, "is an excellent vehicle to dismantle the department because it would entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the states and the people." The bill would abolish the Department of Education one year after its enactment; roll all elementary and post-secondary education programs into two separate block grants; and eliminate major portions of the federal education bureaucracy. 
<p>	According to Doyle and Olson, "Since its creation in 1979, the Department of Education has done precisely what its severest critics envisioned: It has usurped state and local control of education by slowly imposing a steady stream of bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive rules and requirements and has inserted itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts."  
<p>	The result, besides taking control away from parents, teachers and local officials, is "practically no positive impact on student performance." In fact, as the federal government's role in education increased, academic performance of the nation's students has declined. Since the Department of Education was created in 1979, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have stagnated, the high-school dropout rate has risen from 8 percent to 12 percent, and, despite spending more money per pupil on elementary and secondary schools than any other county, math and science test scores of American 13-year-olds still lag behind those of other industrial countries. 
<p>	"Taxpayers should recognize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to 'federalize' the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of our children's education," say Doyle and Olson. The federal role in education -- currently subsidized to the tune of more than $31 billion per year -- has expanded from 100 programs in 1980 to more than 240 today.	
<p>	Yet, the federal government does have an important role to play in education, the authors say. "Washington should limit its role to doing things states and localities cannot do themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose," they say. For example, "the federal government has an overriding responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school or out." In addition, they acknowledge a federal role for "data collection, dissemination, analysis and research, and in helping poor school children get a good education (through creation of school voucher systems, for example). All of these jobs can be handled at the agency level, the analysts say. 
<p>	 "One the other hand," they say, "when it comes to such basic educational matters as management of classroom instruction, adoption of curricula, and text book selection, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice."
<p>	"It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education. States and localities are the 'laboratories of democracy'; educational reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high from a bunch of Washington bureaucrats," Doyle and Olson say.

<center><B>Executive Summary</B><P>
</center>

<b><i>Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>

The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>

Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>

In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p></b></i>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  
<b><i>The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>

<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 
</Pre>

<a name="Three"</a>
<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
   
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  
<b><i>The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>

Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.</i></b>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, MARCH 29, 1996</B> -- Congress approval today of legislation 
scrapping Depression-era crop programs that make U.S. farmers dependent on government and 
cost taxpayers billions of dollars was immediately praised as a &QUOT;dramatic and welcome&QUOT; step in 
the right direction.<P>
	&QUOT;For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the 
government,&QUOT; said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of the Heritage Foundations Agriculture Policy 
Project and one of the architects of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">reform plan</a>. &QUOT;Consumers win with more competitive 
prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the 
freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market.&QUOT;<P>
	The legislation, while it doesnt go as far as Frydenlund had recommended, will replace 
open-ended subsidies for crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and rice with a system of &QUOT;transition 
payments&QUOT; -- guaranteed payments that decline and eventually cease by the year 2002.<P>
	When Frydenlund first proposed the elimination of agriculture subsidy programs in an 
April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, &QUOT;Freeing Americas Farmers,&QUOT; few in Washington gave 
his recommendations much chance of passage. Yet the House-Senate conference report on 
agriculture, which is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton, pushes policy 
dramatically in the same direction -- eliminating government programs that rob American 
consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars and deny farmers the ability to profit from the 
explosive growth in the global demand for food.<P>
	Frydenlund says that although the farm bill failed to reform the costly sugar and peanut 
programs, &QUOT;it is a dramatic and welcome departure from 60 years of command-and-control 
agriculture policy.&QUOT;<P>
	The reform plan proposed by Frydenlund, had it been adopted in its entirety, would have 
phased out all crop subsidies and support payments over five years and, according to a detailed 
computer analysis, would have added $35 billion to the economy of rural America over that same 
period of time.<P>

<hr><h2>HOUSE HEALTH-CARE REFORM PLAN BETTER THAN KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PLAN
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 27, 1996</b> -- A health-care <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bgup271.html">reform bill</a> scheduled for a 
vote in the House of Representatives this Thursday would go a long way toward solving the 
problems of availability, portability and affordability of health insurance, more so than the 
Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.<p>
	&quot;Anxiety about todays health-insurance coverage stems from the fact that coverage is 
tied to the workplace,&quot; says Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. &quot;Workers and dependents are covered 
by an employer-based health-insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same 
employer. If a worker loses his job, he gets no tax break if he buys individual coverage, and if he 
takes another job, he may encounter difficulties getting new coverage if he has a pre-existing 
medical condition.&quot;<p> 
	The Senate bill tries to address these problems, Liu says, but it fails to treat the problems 
at their source: the fact that health insurance -- unlike other types of insurance -- is owned by 
employers, rather than individual workers. This anomaly, he notes, is encouraged by the tax 
code.<p>
	Sponsored by eight House members, the Health Coverage and Affordability Act would 
enable Americans to keep their health insurance when they change or lose their jobs, allow 
individuals to purchase health insurance outside of the workplace, and allow self-employed 
individuals to deduct 50 percent (up from the current 30 percent) of the amount paid for health 
insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House legislation is being coordinated by 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.<p>
	Effective health-care reform, Liu says, would offer the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Group-to-Group portability/tax equity. The best way to achieve portability, Liu says, is 
to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance independent of their employers, and 
still receive the tax breaks they get for employer-based insurance. This would benefit most of 
todays uninsured, especially the self-employed and those working at small firms that are  unable 
to provide health insurance, the Heritage analyst says.<p>
	<li> Limits on exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions for those who lose employer-
based coverage. Liu says Kassebaum-Kennedys guaranteed availability and renewability of 
health insurance is &quot;a welcome and long-overdue improvement in todays health insurance 
market.&quot; The House proposal would similarly limit the ability of insurance carriers to impose 
eligibility or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience or medical history.<p>
	<li> Group-purchasing arrangements to allow small employers and associations to pool their 
purchasing power and get reasonably priced coverage. Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts -- through 
creation of so-called Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) -- to make insurance more 
affordable for small employers and the self-employed. But, Liu says, because HPPCs would 
receive more favorable treatment from certain state laws than other types of plans, they would 
have an unfair advantage. &quot;Instead of creating an uneven playing field, Congress should ensure 
that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or not, are treated equally,&quot; Liu says.<p>
</ul>
	&quot;To achieve true health-insurance reform, Kassebaum-Kennedy must incorporate key 
proposals from the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act now making its way 
through the House. Only then can Congress give working Americans what they want from 
health-insurance reform: true portability and more choice through the purchase of  individual 
policies that provide long-term protection against catastrophic illness. If Americans are allowed 
to comparison shop among a variety of health plans, costs can be controlled,&quot; Liu says.<p>

<h2>U.S. SHOULD OPPOSE CHINA'S EFFORTS TO DELAY<BR>
GLOBAL FREE TRADE WITH TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 22, 1996</b> -- In addition to threatening Taiwan militarily, the Peoples Republic of China is trying to prevent the island nation from gaining entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before China itself does -- a move the United States <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html">should oppose</a>, says an Asia analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	One of Americas largest trading partners, Taiwan is taking steps to meet the economic requirements for entry into the WTO, the organization that sets the rules for international free trade, says Heritage Asian Trade and Economics Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert OQuinn</a>. These include lifting all import bans and slashing tariffs on foreign goods, which would boost trade between Taiwan and other countries, including the United States. 
<p>
	But theres a problem. &quot;The most significant obstacle to Taiwans membership in the 
WTO is not economic, it is political,&quot; OQuinn says. &quot;China insists that Taiwan should not join 
the WTO before China does.&quot; This is true even though Taiwans economy is more advanced than 
Chinas. For China, however, the chief concern is that the world recognize its status as a global 
economic power and its primacy over Taiwan, something it feels is threatened if Taiwan gains 
entry to the WTO first.<p>
	Although the United States cannot unilaterally set the terms for WTO admittance, it 
should &quot;be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwans membership, even 
in the face of Chinas determined opposition,&quot; OQuinn says. In addition, the United States 
should work closely with the European Union and Japan -- the other key players in the trade 
organization -- to build a consensus within the WTO for admitting China only on &quot;commercially 
viable&quot; terms, not for political reasons.<p> 
	Unfortunately, OQuinn says, the Clinton administration seems willing to bow to Chinas 
demands, a position at odds with U.S. economic goals. &quot;As the worlds largest exporter, the 
United States has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO 
applicants,&quot; he says. &quot;Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTOs economic 
criteria should be free to join.&quot;<p>
	This is not to say the administration shouldnt look for ways to let both countries join the 
WTO at the same time, which would &quot;be the best outcome for all parties,&quot; OQuinn says. But 
that may not be possible. China -- with its high tariffs, strict import controls, and anti-
competitive industrial policy -- must do much more to reform its economy than Taiwan before it 
can qualify for entry.<p>  
	OQuinn says there is a way the Clinton administration might get China not only to speed 
up its economic reforms, but to drop its opposition to Taiwan-first WTO entry: Offer China 
permanent &quot;most-favored nation&quot; (MFN) trading status. This is something China values highly, 
so much so that it might be willing to make concessions. OQuinn says the administration should 
ask Congress for the authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, the 1975 
law that requires Chinas MFN status to be renewed every year.<p>
	In the meantime, OQuinn says, the administration should continue to insist that Taiwans 
entry into the WTO not be held hostage to Chinas demands. &quot;Taiwan should join the WTO 
when it is ready,&quot; he says, &quot;not when Beijing says it can.&quot;<p>

<center><h3>EMPOWER AMERICA'S WILLIAM BENNETT AND JACK KEMP
&quot;CORRECT THE RECORD&quot; WITH NEW STUDY ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION</h3></center>

<center><h4><i>Kemp and Bennett call assertions made in the GOP Presidential 
primarie regarding the impact of legal immigration &quot;naive, 
short-sighted, and now -- factually incorrect.&quot;</i></center></h4>
<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>

(Washington, DC; February 28, 1996)  Empower America co-directors William J. 
Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study today which refutes many recent 
assertions against legal immigration policy in America.  The study comes as 
immigration is becoming an increasingly contentious issue in the race for the 
GOP presidential nomination.  Bennett and Kemp said, &quot;Certainly we must put 
an end to illegal immigration.  But that message cannot be mixed up with our 
view toward legal immigration, which has been, and continues to be, a net gain 
<tt></tt>for America.&quot;<p>

Through research conducted over a period of many months, visits to high 
technology companies, background interviews with government officials, and 
never before presented data, researcher Stuart Anderson has found, &quot;The entry of 
foreign-born engineers, scientists, and other highly skilled individuals provides 
extraordinary benefits to the United States and should be facilitated, rather than 
indered, by new restrictions.&quot;<p>

The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering legislation by Senator Alan 
Simpson (R-WY) to sharply restrict American companies' ability to hire foreign-
born skilled employees.  Moreover, in March, the U.S. House of Representatives 
will vote on the largest reduction in legal immigration in nearly 70 years.  Said 
Bennett and Kemp, &quot;The study gives evidence that both measures are ill-
conceived and ultimately counterproductive.&quot;<p>


Among the study's key findings:
<ul>
<li>	There is no evidence that foreign-born scientists and engineers increase 
unemployment or undercut the wages of the native-born.<p>

<li>	There is no evidence that employment-based immigration weakens 
companies' commitment to U.S. education or to training for their workforce.  
American companies annually donate $2.5 billion to schools and colleges, and 
spend $210 billion annually on workforce training.<p>

<li>	Key employees and even founders of high tech companies enter the country 
as refugees and family-sponsored immigrants, as well as employment-based 
immigrants.<p>

<li> 	The study concludes, &quot;New restrictions on employment-based visas -- and 
immigration more generally -- will drive more companies to locate research 
and development offshore ... and will lead to less innovation, a less dynamic 
economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge industries of 
tomorrow.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Jack Kemp said, &quot;We have got to understand that we are getting some of the best 
and brightest minds from all over the world to invest their talents in America's 
economy.  We are becoming more competitive and more prosperous and, as the 
study shows, we aren't displacing or devaluing American workers in the 
process.&quot<p>  

William Bennett added, &quot;We have seen too much anti-immigration rhetoric in 
our public discourse and in our Republican-led Congress -- and unfortunately, it 
has become a centerpiece of Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign.  It's time to 
remind Americans -- and the Republican Party especially -- that legal 
immigration helps, not hurts, America.  While there is no question that American 
society has experienced serious moral decay over the last thirty years, pinning 
the blame on immigrants for our problems is a dodge and distraction.  And it 
happens to be entirely wrong.  One can make a strong argument that many new 
immigrants have been corrupted by those degraded aspects of our culture, not 
causes of it.&quot;<p>

<h2>GOVERNORS' WELFARE REFORM PLAN FAILS<BR>
TO TACKLE ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

NGA Plan a Poor Model<br>
For Upcoming Legislation<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 19, 1995</b>  -- The welfare reform plan developed by the nations governors for use  as a reform model on Capitol Hill completely ignores illegitimacy -- the No. 1 problem experts have identified as perpetuating the welfare culture, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1075.html">Heritage Foundation</a> analyst said today.

<p>
According to<a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm"> Robert Rector</a>, senior analyst for welfare and family issues, &QUOT;Illegitimacy and 
family collapse are the keys that open the door not only to perpetual welfare dependency, but to a host 
of other problems such as crime, poverty, drug abuse and school failure. Yet the National Governors 
Association (NGA) not only has abandoned the goal of reducing illegitimacy, it has devised a plan that 
would  provide even more government-funded support services to an expanding population of single 
mothers.&QUOT;<P>
	Thus, the NGA plan, &QUOT;sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social 
service spending in the future,&QUOT; Rector says. A combined welfare-Medicaid reform package is expected 
to be introduced in Congress this month and taken up by the House and Senate in May. Rector says 
Congress would do well to &QUOT;just say no to the welfare reform plan offered by the NGA and pass instead 
legislation that makes reducing illegitimacy, encouraging marriage, and requiring work top priorities.&QUOT;<P>
	&QUOT;By refusing to acknowledge or even mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are 
implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. 
They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out 
of wedlock and raised in government-supported day care centers,&QUOT; Rector warns. &QUOT;This is not reform; it 
is a national disaster.&QUOT;<P> 
	Rector points out that nearly a third of all children born in America last year were born out of 
wedlock. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. The 
illegitimate birth rate among whites is nearly 25 percent, almost equaling the black rate in the 1960s 
when policy-makers -- notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., -- warned of the consequences 
associated with the erosion of marriages in black families. <P>
	Rector says children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those 
born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more 
likely to give birth out of wedlock themselves when compared to girls from intact families not on 
welfare. Often, they repeat the mothers pattern of having a child and applying for welfare, thus 
continuing the generational cycle of dependence. A poor boy from a single-parent home in the inner 
city is twice as likely to engage in crime compared to a similar boy living with both parents.<P>
	Not only does the NGA plan fail to address illegitimacy, it also guts the work requirements 
from the last House-Senate conference bill, according to Rector.<P>  
	&QUOT;There are so many loopholes in the NGA plan that no welfare recipients would be required to 
work,&QUOT; he says.  Just one example: Up to 20 percent of recipients counted as working can be enrolled in 
vocational education, a remedy that has proved ineffective in the past.<P>
	&QUOT;Just as it did in 1988, the NGA is offering cosmetic welfare reform,&QUOT; Rector says. &QUOT;The public 
was told that welfare would be replaced by work. Then, as now, the NGA opposed real work 
requirements. As a consequence, welfare reform resulted in an explosion of day care funding, and 
welfare caseloads grew by some 30 percent. Now, it looks like history is about to repeat itself.&QUOT;<P>

<h2>FLAT-TAX PLAN WOULD LOWER TAXES<br>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1996</b> --  A Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">analysis</a> of the 17-
percent flat-tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., shows &quot;no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class 
Americans when compared with their current tax burden.&quot;<p>
	In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups, 
according to the report by William Beach, visiting fellow in tax analysis, and Daniel Mitchell, 
McKenna senior fellow in political economy.<p>
	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90t1.gif">table</a> provided by the Heritage analysts, based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, shows 
that under a 17 percent flat tax, households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income 
will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in their tax burden. In fact, &quot;About 24 million families 
who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented 
Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the analysts say, &quot;and nearly everyone else below $30,000 in taxable 
income will see their taxes fall.&quot;<p>
	For example, households whose taxable income ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 per 
year would see nearly a 36 percent drop in federal taxes. Those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range 
would pay almost 16 percent less; and those in the $50,000 to $75,000 taxable-income range 
would pay almost 12 percent less.<p>
	Will lower taxes mean higher deficits for the federal government? Not according to the 
Heritage analysts, who say the loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-Shelby 
plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. &quot;Corporate 
income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the Heritage analysts point out. &quot;This 
largely offsets decreases in individual income tax payments during the two years it will take to 
implement this tax reform. Taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from 
corporations will rise by $52 billion.&quot; <p>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


                        WASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1996</b> -- Hailed as a bold move to roll back big 
government by returning power to the states, the Medicaid-reform plan touted by the nations 
governors actually preserves some of the worst elements of the program and creates a costly new 
state entitlement to federal money, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi89.html">analysis</a>.<P>
	Unless changes are made to the plan, which forms the basis of legislation being crafted by 
the congressional leadership, it &QUOT;will be a disaster rather than a reform,&QUOT; says Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. To prevent this outcome, he says, Congress should limit the 
categories of Americans guaranteed coverage under Medicaid and cancel the open-ended state 
entitlement to federal money.<P>
	According to Liu, the governors plan claims to scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor 
of a system of block grants (or cash payments) to the states, yet preserves a long list of benefits 
that must be provided to a large, entitled population.  In fact, of the 33 million Americans on 
Medicaid in 1993, fully 71 percent would still be guaranteed benefits under the governors plan.<P>
&QUOT;The governors plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and 
costly entitlement feature of Medicaid,&QUOT; Liu says.<P>
	Since the governors decision to guarantee Medicaid coverage to so many people will 
impose heavy burdens on state budgets, Liu says, they also included an &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; 
provision that entitles states to federal money.  If states experience an unanticipated rise in the 
number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government would bear the cost, which 
almost certainly would increase the federal deficit.  &QUOT;The states have figured out a way to write 
blank checks on the federal treasury,&QUOT; Liu says.  This is hard to justify, he says, when the federal 
share of Medicaid costs is projected to reach $100 billion this fiscal year.<P>
	If Medicaid reform is to go beyond merely cosmetic changes, Liu says, Congress must fix 
these problems. First, lawmakers should sharply limit who is entitled to what under Medicaid, 
focusing benefits on the truly needy such as the homeless and mentally ill.  Second, Congress 
should turn the state entitlement to &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; into an annual appropriation with a 
fixed amount of money. This would give states needed protection from sudden increases in the 
Medicaid population, but not an open pipeline to the federal treasury.<P>
	&QUOT;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then 
Medicaid ... will require more, not less, fiscal discipline,&QUOT; Liu says.  Without changes, he says, 
the governors Medicaid reform plan &QUOT;should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of 
the open-ended entitlement status of todays program.&QUOT;  <P>

<h2>"TEAM B" ADVISES CONGRESS: WITHDRAW FROM ABM, BUILD MISSILE DEFENSES<br>
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

Administration &QUOT;More Interested In Defending<BR> 
ABM Treaty Than Defending America&QUOT;<p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 12, 1996</b> -- The United States should withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and adopt a plan for defending America from ballistic missile attack by building effective sea-based and space-based defenses, the Heritage Foundations "Team B" missile defense study team <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1074.html">said today</a>.<p>

	Top priority, the study panel said, should be given to expanding the Navys Aegis air-
defense system with a missile-defense component able to protect wide areas of the United States 
and other countries from incoming ballistic missiles by the year 1999. Ultimately, America 
should aim for cooperation among allied nations in building the kind of international anti-
ballistic missile system called for by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this 
weekend, the panel said.<P>
	Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to introduce missile-defense 
legislation on Thursday of this week, and both houses of Congress will hold hearings shortly 
thereafter, extending into April.<P> 
	The Heritage Foundation panel, led by former Strategic Defense Initiative Organization 
Director Amb. Henry Cooper, says in its report that Congress needs to face up to the fact that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of defending Americans against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack. In short, the administration considers the 1972 ABM Treaty more important than 
missile defenses -- a conclusion with which the panel sharply disagrees.<P>

ABM Treaty or ABM/TMD Treaty?<p>
	The Team B consensus is that no long-term, effective defense of the American people 
against ballistic missiles can be built within the constraints of the ABM Treaty. &QUOT; The ABM 
Treaty is stifling the development of todays most capable and effective defense systems and 
perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases and allies 
overseas,&QUOT; Team B says. &QUOT;Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations 
delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;The time has come for the United States to exercise its right under Article XV of the 
ABM Treaty to give six months notice to Russia, withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and build the 
needed defenses,&quot; the blue-ribbon panel says in the 1996 edition of &quot;Defending America: Ending 
Americas Vulnerability To Ballistic Missiles.&quot; <p>
	Yet, the Clinton administration not only exhibits &quot;a slavish adherence&quot; to a treaty signed 
with the now defunct Soviet Union, it even appears committed to expanding the treatys reach so 
it prevents the building of theater missile defenses (TMD). The administration reportedly has 
accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater missile 
defenses. It has even &quot;dumbed down&quot; the capabilities of theater defense systems rather than 
make them as capable as available technology will permit<p>. 
	In short, &quot;if the administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be 
built. The administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending 
Americans,&qupt; Team B concludes.<p>
Administration Obfuscation<p>	
	&quot;The administrations actions over the past year, characterized chiefly by the presidents 
veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization bill, demonstrate that the American people cannot 
depend on the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the 
common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow,&quot; the Team B report says.<p>
	&quot;While publicly claiming it is vigorously pursuing missile defenses, the administration
has quietly canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive 
missile defense programs, while supporting more expensive, less effective ones and extending 
their development time, thereby increasing costs,&quot; Team B says. &quot;It has become regrettably clear 
that the Clinton administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy.&quot;    <p>
The Threat<p>
	The United States still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic 
missiles (ICBMs). &quot;Contrary to what most Americans believe,&quot; the Team B analysts say, &quot;if  an 
ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single 
thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their 
targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possible millions, of Americans.&quot;<p>
	The Clinton administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American 
homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat 
develops. &quot;Yet, American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles,&quot; Team 
B points out. &quot;A Chinese official recently threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the United States 
interfered with Chinas feud with Taiwan. North Koreas nuclear and missile programs recently 
prompted the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea to request that theater missile defense 
development be expedited. Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last 
year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away. Rogue states could 
threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- sooner if they chose to 
accelerate their development plans,&quot; Team B analysts say. <p>
What Congress Should Do?<p>
	Team B says &quot;America should indicate clearly to the Russians that the United States 
intends to provide effective wide-area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops 
and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russias agreement.&quot; However, if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, &quot;Congress should use all available powers and prerogatives to move 
America toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months notice, which it has a 
right to do under Article XV,&quot; say the Team B analysts. <p>
	Then, Congress should &quot;press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-
term defenses technically feasible. This means a de-emphasis of ground-based defenses -- since 
they can be overcome by countermeasures, are expensive, and are difficult to deploy. Highest 
priority should be assigned to expanding and converting the Navys Aegis air-defense system to 
missile defense and deploying theater defenses based on this model by the year 1999.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;For an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 Aegis 
cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile-defense capability for the 
United States and for U.S. forces and allies overseas,&quot; the Team B analysts say. &quot;These highly 
mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile 
strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas.&quot;<p>
	In addition, the development of space-based sensors and defenses, both kinetic-energy 
interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated, the Team B analysts say. &quot;With the 
necessary funding support, deployment of such systems can begin shortly after the year 2000. 
For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.&quot;<p>
	&quot;The Clinton administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind 
a smokescreen of positive-sounding but meaningless policy declarations,&quot; the Team B analysts 
conclude. &quot;It is clear that the Clinton administration will remain derelict in the duties required of 
the office of the commander-in-chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress 
must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the 
improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executives dereliction of 
duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology will permit.&quot;<p>

<h2>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




                WASHINGTON, MARCH 11, 1996</b> -- Although the 1996 budget battle between 
Congress and the White House is still unresolved, President Clinton has already released a new 
1997 budget that boosts spending by $361 billion and tax revenues by $526 billion over the next 
seven years, according to a<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1071.html"> new report</a> by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	For every household in America, the new White House budget means $1,927 in higher 
taxes and $3,155 in higher spending over seven years, compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget 
Act that the president vetoed last fall, says Heritage budget specialist <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.<P>
	Moreover, the White House budget would add $119 billion more in deficits through 2002 
than Congress Balanced Budget Act, the equivalent of increasing the debt burden on the average 
household by $1,227, Hodge says.<P>
	&quot;Just weeks after telling the nation in this years State of the Union address that the era 
of big government is over, President Clinton [has] indicated that the obituary notice was 
premature,&quot; says Hodge, Heritages Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs.<p>
	He says while the White House plan would, on paper, balance the budget by 2002, it can 
only do so &quot;by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.&quot;  For 
example, the budget claims to save $596 billion over the next seven years, but fully 60 percent of 
that deficit reduction is scheduled to happen after President Clinton leaves office.<p>
	Whats more, the family tax cuts in the presidents plan come in the early years, then 
screech to a halt in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget. The result: Families depending on a 
planned $500-per-child tax credit would get hit in 2002 with a $17 billion tax increase.  Whats 
more, the president offsets the $98 billion he proposes in tax cuts with $59 billion in tax 
increases.  The resulting net tax cut of $39 billion represents just 3 cents of every $1,000 
taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years, Hodge says.<p>
	While tax relief under the White House budget is negligible, spending on entitlement 
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare steams ahead, increasing by $365 billion, or 50 
percent, over seven years.  All told, spending on mandatory programs under the White House 
budget would rise from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar 
in 2002. <p> 
	And although the president proposes to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 
billion over seven years, thats not nearly enough to save the program from impending 
bankruptcy, Hodge says.  In fact, the news that in 1995 the Medicare Hospital Insurance program 
paid out $36 million more in benefits than it took in from payroll taxes shows the program could 
face a financial crisis even sooner than the projected bankruptcy in 2002.<p>
	The situation with Medicaid is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, 
Hodge says, states probably will need to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion over seven 
years to pay for it. The White House response is to slow Medicaid spending increases by $59 
billion over the same period, which does little good when maintaining the programs entitlement 
status could cost states more than $47 billion.<p>
	There is, Hodge says, one area of the budget where the White House does propose real 
changes: spending for social programs is greatly expanded.  While short on details -- which are 
scheduled to be supplied in the administrations full budget due later this month -- the current 
White House budget &quot;outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as 
education, high technology, crime fighting and the environment,&quot; Hodge says. Compared to the 
Balanced Budget Act, the president proposes spending an extra $111 billion over seven years on 
discretionary programs.<p>
	Yet oddly, Hodge says, the White House also claims to &quot;save&quot; $297 billion in 
discretionary programs over seven years.  Of course, these savings are calculated by using the 
Congressional Budget Offices &quot;baseline,&quot; which assumes automatic spending increases every 
year.  Under this accounting system, simply freezing discretionary spending at 1995 levels would 
&quot;save&quot; $258 billion over seven years.  The extra $39 billion the president proposes to save? 
Hodge says 95 percent of these cuts come in 2001 and 2002, when President Clinton can no 
longer be in office.<p> 
	&quot;The administrations repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys ... casts doubt on 
its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress,&quot; Hodge says. &quot;The Clinton 
budget is not the end of big government,  it is the embodiment of it.&quot;<p>

<title>White House Retreat on Free Trade Bodes Ill for U.S. - Heritage PR</title>

BODES ILL FOR U.S., ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1996</b> -- Bowing to protectionist pressure, the White House is backing away from its commitment to free trade in the Western Hemisphere, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1070.html">policy shift</a> that could derail the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), damage relations with Mexico and discredit U.S. leadership on free trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	Opponents of free trade have accused NAFTA of causing everything from the Mexican economic crisis and declining U.S. wages to increased illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The fact that the White House has allowed such charges to go unanswered shows that "free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton administration," says Heritage Latin America Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>.
<p>
	On the contrary, over the past year the White House has taken steps to downgrade NAFTA, first by reneging on a promise to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996 and then by violating key provisions of the trade pact such as allowing Mexican trucks to operate in U.S. border states. 
<p>	If the Clinton administration continues to shirk its obligations under NAFTA, Sweeney says, it will establish "a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada and other countries could follow in the future." Even now, Sweeney says, political leaders throughout Latin America are questioning the administration's commitment to free trade. The possible result: "If Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide," he says.
<p>	To prevent NAFTA from falling into disrepute, Sweeney says the White House must take a number of steps to strengthen the treaty. Not only should the administration respect NAFTA's provisions, it should complete the trade pact's unfinished business with Mexico, which includes forgiving Mexico's public debt and working out solutions to immigration, labor and law-enforcement problems. In addition, the White House should reverse course and speed up the process of admitting Chile to NAFTA.
<p>	Sweeney says the administration has nothing to fear from critics of NAFTA, whose charges have proven untrue. For example, the claim that NAFTA caused the Mexican economic crisis couldn't be more wrong. "The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency," he says.  "If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious."
<p>	NAFTA also remains crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the new global economy, Sweeney says. U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than exports to the rest of the world. Even in 1995, when the Mexican economic crisis was at its worst, the United States still exported more to Mexico than it did before NAFTA. All told, the United States exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America every year -- more than half of that to Mexico -- supporting nearly 2 million U.S. jobs.
<p>	By backing away from free trade, and NAFTA, the White House is also threatening U.S. relations with Mexico, Sweeney says. NAFTA is crucial if Mexico is to emerge from its economic crisis. If that crisis continues, he says, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow, with conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking displacing cooperation on trade and investment. Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in seeing Mexico become a stable, capitalist democracy. But "without NAFTA, [Mexican President Ernesto] Zedillo's chance of advancing political reforms would be very poor," Sweeney says.
<p>	If American relations with Mexico deteriorate through half-hearted U.S. support for NAFTA, the Clinton administration faces the risk of forfeiting America's leadership role as the champion of free trade in the Western Hemisphere, Sweeney says. In fact, the dream of creating a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone by the year 2005, ostensibly shared by the White House, could collapse.  
<p>	"The Clinton administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere," Sweeney says. "The task for American policy-makers now is to correct the current drift in policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible."

<html><title>Architect of Free-Market Farm Bill Assesses Congress' Reform Bill -- Heritage PR</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
               214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>                     Washington, D.C. 20002<br>                              (202) 546-4400<br><hr><h2> ARCHITECT OF FREE-MARKET FARM PLAN
ASSESSES CONGRESS' REFORM BILL</h2>
</center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1996</b> -- A principal architect of the agriculture-reform plan moving through Congress praised the effort to replace America's Depression-era farm policy with a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">market-based system</a>, but said Congress' failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs would cost consumers billions of dollars per year in higher prices. 
<P>
	The House of Representatives last week passed the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which incorporates many of the major structural changes proposed in the April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, "Freeing America's Farmers." The Senate passed similar legislation earlier this year.
<p>
	The legislation would end government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops through quotas and planting restrictions. Most dramatically, farm subsidies would be replaced by steadily decreasing "market-transition" payments that would end after seven years.  The House and Senate are expected to iron out differences between the two bills in conference this week.
<p>	"For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the government," said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project.  "Consumers win with more competitive prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market."
<p>	Published in advance of last year's congressional debate over reauthorizing America's farm programs, the Heritage farm policy blueprint also called for the elimination of the Farmer-Owned Reserve -- a surplus cache of crops the government uses to hold down commodity prices artificially by flooding the market.  This recommendation also was adopted by both the House and Senate.
<P>	While the farm bills mark a dramatic, and welcome, departure from command-and-control agriculture policy, Frydenlund says Congress should have adopted other elements of the Heritage plan as well. The failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs is one glaring omission, he says, as is leaving intact a component of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/em448.html">dairy program</a> that will force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk. "A truly free-market approach to farm policy would have ended these programs," he says.
<P>	Frydenlund also says Congress should have done more to reform the Conservation Reserve Program, an environmental program that too often pays farmers to take productive land out of use. "The least Congress should do is let farmers remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program," he says.
<p>	Another problem: Under the new system, market-transition payments will actually cost the government more in the first few years than traditional subsidies, an outcome Frydenlund warned against in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib216.html">Heritage paper</a> in September of last year. At the time, he urged Congress to set a "trigger price" for commodities that, if exceeded, would cancel or reduce transition payments for a given year. This can be easily fixed, however, in the House-Senate conference, he says.
<P>	Despite these shortcomings, Frydenlund says the farm bills go further than any piece of legislation in U.S. history to create a free market for agriculture. "Outdated farm programs are robbing American consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars a year and denying farmers the right to take advantage of explosive growth in the worldwide demand for food," he says.  "Congress has taken a huge step toward correcting these injustices."

<title>U.S. Shouldn't Rule Out Use of Force if China Attacks Taiwan - Heritage PR</title>

<b>Clinton's Weak Signals <br>
Risk Crisis In Taiwan Strait</b>

<center><h2>U.S. SHOULDN'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE
IF CHINA ATTACKS TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<b> For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>	WASHINGTON, MARCH 4, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan in response to the island nation's first-ever presidential elections March 23 -- nor should it rule out the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html">use of force</a> in case of such an attack, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>, senior analyst with Heritage's Asian Studies Center, the administration should order the U.S. Navy to hold exercises near Taiwan during the period before and after the March 23 presidential election to deter Chinese military action. Also, it should sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, including advanced air-to-air missiles, conventional submarines, and missile-defense systems.
<p>	"By failing to assure China's leaders of U.S. intentions in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could do incalculable damage to Taiwan, U.S.-China relations and U.S. leadership in Asia," Fisher warns.
<p>	President Clinton therefore must take "strong but measured steps" to convey to Beijing America's clear interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Fisher says that in addition to warning China that U.S. force is an option, and deploying the U.S. Navy to deter Chinese military action, the Clinton administration should:
<p><ul>
<li>	 In compliance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, inform Chinese leaders that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States";<p>
<li> Tell China it may face economic sanctions, ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo;<p>
<li> Maintain the balance of power in Asia by deploying missile defenses to protect U.S. forces stationed there, thus offsetting China's demonstrated willingness to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan; and<p>
<li> Recognize Taiwan's democratic reforms and urge China and the Republic of China (ROC) to resolve their differences peacefully.
</ul><p>
	Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway as the presidential election approaches. "China fears the emergence of Taiwan as a model for political reform on the mainland, and continues to reserve the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare independence," Fisher points out.
<p>	Fisher says President Clinton's failure to respond adequately to recent Chinese saber-rattling in the South China Sea and against Taiwan "fosters an impression of American weakness, and lends encouragement to Chinese hard-liners." He adds that "Several statements by Clinton administration officials to the effect that the United States will not defend Taiwan if it is attacked are potentially even more destabilizing."
<p>	"At stake is not only peace and security in the region, but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. Also, with a population of 21 million and trade with the United States totaling $47 billion per year, the ROC is the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, right behind China itself," Fisher says.
<p>	"The United States cannot afford to let the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorate further without grave consequences for U.S. stature in Asia," he says. "The Clinton administration must make clear the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan."

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MARCH 1, 1996</b> -- Congress should identify and eliminate a host of government programs that special-interest groups use to fund lobbying and political activities many taxpayers would not willingly support, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<P>	 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/griffin.html">Charles Griffin</a>, deputy director of Heritage's Government  Reform Project, Congress' 1995 effort to stop what he calls "taxpayer-funded political slush funds" fell far short of what is needed to solve the problem. "Not only are many political lobbying groups still able to draw billions of taxpayer dollars into their coffers," Griffin says, "such groups also tend to be the strongest supporters of bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation -- which guarantee them continued funding."
<p>	Griffin identifies the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1069.html">top 10 government programs</a> that give taxpayer-funded grants to hundreds of special interests, which then use the money for political purposes. For example, by law, participants in AmeriCorps, President's Clinton's national service program, are barred from engaging in partisan political activities. Yet, in one reported instance, a nonprofit group, the Cole Coalition in Cole, Colo., used AmeriCorps volunteers to draft campaign fliers attacking a local politician and distribute them door-to-door. "We realized there was something politically partisan," said 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor. "Although the Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding," Griffin says, "the AmeriCorps program lives on -- as does the potential for abuse." 
<p>	Another major violator, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) -- funded at $400 million per year -- was originally established to provide legal services to the poor in civil and non-criminal matters. Griffin says the LSC uses its budget to funnel federal taxpayer dollars to 323 private groups around the country that use the money to fight legal battles having clear political objectives. "Through litigation, advocacy and lobbying, the LSC has helped to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending and the addition of hundreds of millions of people to the welfare rolls," Griffin says. 
<p>	For example, LSC grantees have sued governments at all levels to stop welfare reform and have worked to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. "It's not that people don't have a right to engage in such activities," Griffin adds. "It's that they shouldn't be allowed to do so with the taxpayers' money."
<p>	 A third example from the top 10 list, the Department of Health and Human Services' Discretionary Aging Projects, is funded at $26 million per year. While the stated purpose of the project is to provide trained personnel and programs that improve the quality of life for the elderly, Griffin says the money in the program is often used to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest groups. 
<p>	"The National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 percent of its budget from federal funds and is one of many such groups that promote government interventionism," Griffin says.  Other grantees benefiting from the program in 1994 included groups that actively opposed Medicare reform, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
<p>	Griffin says funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests to subsidize their political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse of the public's money and the public trust. 
<p>	"If the situation were reversed and millions of taxpayer dollars were going to conservative activist groups, the response would be sheer outrage. Political orientation aside, Congress needs to put an end to this egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars," Griffin says.

TOUGHER RESPONSE TO CUBA</h2>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 29, 1996</b> -- Calling economic sanctions against Cuba an insufficient response to the island nation's downing of two U.S. civilian aircraft, a Heritage Foundation analyst today outlined a series of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi88.html">tough measures</a> the United States should take to further isolate Fidel Castro.
<p>
	"In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force," Heritage Latin American Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a> says in a new paper.
<p>	Specifically, Sweeney says the U.S. government should:
<p><ul>
	<li> Warn Cuba that the United States will enforce international law in the region.  Any attacks by Cuba against civilian aircraft or boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit established by international law should be met with a "prompt, immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces," he says.  U.S. warplanes should patrol the waters between Florida and Cuba to enable a rapid response.
<p>
<li> Ban the flow of all cash from the United States to Cuba, which props up the Castro regime with more than $500 million a year in hard currency.
	<p><li> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by U.S. citizens -- including journalists, academics and business people -- and ban travel to the United States by all Cubans until the Castro regime extends the same travel privileges to opposition leaders as it does to communist officials.
<P><li> Impose strict controls over the activities and movements of Cuban officials in the United States.  The Castro regime bans democratic and human rights groups from meeting freely in Cuba; the U.S. government should deny Cuban officials those same freedoms in the United States, expelling all violators.
<p><li>Warn Castro that the United States will view any attempt to spark a new refugee crisis as a hostile act against the national security of the United States.
<p><li> Use Radio Marti to inform Cubans that U.S. actions are aimed at Castro, not at them, to counter Castro's anti-American propaganda.
<p><li> Publicly oppose the activation in Cuba of a nuclear reactor based on an unsafe East German design, which would present a security threat to the Southeast United States.

<h2>AS BIG GOVERNMENT WITHERS, LEADING
THINKERS PONDER A REPLACEMENT</h2>
</center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 12, 1996</b> --  If the era of big government is over, as 
President Clinton proclaims, what will replace it? 
<p>
	Lots of things. In the <a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/toc.html">latest issue</a> of 
<I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>, 20 prominent thinkers and 
reformers describe private institutions they would like to see emerge over the next two decades 
to rebuild American community and culture in the wake of the welfare state. 
<p>	<a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/symp.html"> Their suggestions</a> run the gamut 
from police-training programs for kids (proposed by New York City Police Commissioner 
William Bratton) to structured group homes for welfare mothers and their children (Myron 
Magnet, editor of the <I>City Journal</I>, New York City, and author of  "<I>The Dream and the 
Nightmare.</I>" Uniting the proposals is a common belief that reliance on Washington to solve 
society's problems has done more harm than good. American culture and society must be 
renewed the old-fashioned way: by private citizens working hands-on in their own communities.
<P>Not surprisingly, many of the suggestions concern improving America's government-run 
education system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wants all parents to have the 
right -- and the financial ability -- to send their children to any school, public or private. William 
Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton who now teaches at the University of Maryland's 
School of Public Affairs, proposes a new funding system for charter schools, which are quasi-
public but free of much of the stifling bureaucracy that plagues the broader government school 
system.  
<p>	Two participants -- New York Lt. Gov. Elizabeth McCaughey Ross and Jim Pinkerton, 
former Bush administration official and author of "<I>What Comes Next: The End of Big 
Government - And the New Paradigm Ahead</I>" -- even proposed the same idea: a rating 
system for schools (Pinkerton envisions a <I>Consumer Reports</I> for education) that would 
empower parents with information on how money is being spent and how well students are 
performing on standardized tests.
<p>	But education reform is not enough. Bratton, for example, believes many kids need to 
learn respect for the law and law-enforcement officers. His dream of a structured police career 
path for kids -- summer "youth academies" and a police-oriented version of the Boy Scouts 
called Law Enforcement Explorers -- would give young people positive interactions with the 
police, deepen their respect for the law, and even guide some into police careers themselves.
<p>	Myron Magnet envisions group homes for welfare mothers and children where the focus 
is not on the job prospects of young women but on providing structured, caring environments for 
kids. He believes that by the time today's underclass children reach school, it's too late to give 
them the foundation in cognitive and moral skills they will need to succeed. That's what the 
group homes could do.
<p>	Higher education is ripe for some new ideas as well. Harvey Mansfield, professor of 
government at Harvard, longs for a "great books junior college" to give students the education 
they didn't receive in high school and won't receive in politically correct four-year institutions.  
And Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and author of "<I>Hollywood vs. 
America</I>," would go even further, creating an "elite" private university that would go back to 
teaching a classic liberals arts education and compete with the politically correct Ivy League 
schools. 
<p>	Other innovative ideas rounding out the list include: private science funding (perhaps by 
corporations) to reduce the scientific community's dependence on the federal government; 
private, non-profit job-training programs; effective homeless programs run by representatives 
from the religious and business communities; and even new television shows devoted to 
exposing government violations of citizens' rights and celebrating individuals who have 
overcome personal hardships.

<h2> FLAT TAX REDUCES TAX BILLS
IN EVERY STATE, STUDY SHOWS</h2></center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 9, 1996</b> -- Taxpayers in every state would send less of their income to Washington under a 17 percent flat tax, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a>.
<p>	The average annual savings would range from a high of $1,856 per taxpaying household in Connecticut to a low of $318 in California, the study showed. And in 33 states, the average household would see its income-tax bill drop by more than $1,000 per year.
<p>	Nationwide, the 17 percent flat tax would reduce the average household's yearly federal tax bill by more than $1,100, a savings of 25 percent compared to the current system, said Heritage economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>. Taxpayers in many states would save even more. In addition to Connecticut, the top 10 include: New Jersey ($1,521), Illinois ($1,511), North Dakota ($1,506), Virginia ($1,463), Indiana ($1,415), Rhode Island ($1,406), Washington ($1,385), Michigan ($1,372) and Florida ($1,335).
<p>
	With the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes built around the flat tax, tax reform has already emerged as a key 1996 election issue. House Majority Leader Richard Armey,  R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., both have introduced bills that would replace the current tax code with a flat rate that taxes income only once. 
<p>	Contrary to claims that a flat tax might increase the tax burden on middle-income taxpayers, Beach and Mitchell found that "a properly designed flat tax would provide much-needed tax relief" for the average filer.  
<P>	Their analysis of the impact on taxpayers under the Armey-Shelby plan found that households in every state would see their tax bills drop not only in dollar terms, but in percentage terms as well. South Dakota taxpayers would benefit the most, with an average tax decrease of 38 percent. Other states would see big drops too, including North Dakota (33 percent), Indiana (31 percent) and Florida (30 percent).  
<p>	All told, a 17 percent tax rate on individual income would decrease federal tax payments by $125 billion, with the largest savings going to individual taxpayers in New York ($10 billion), Texas ($8 billion), Illinois ($8 billion) and Florida ($8 billion).
<p>	The Heritage analysts also examined the impact on taxpayers of a flat tax rate of 20 percent. At the higher rate, they found, the average tax bill would rise in two states. In California the average increase would be $417; in Montana: $9. In the rest of the states, even a 20 percent rate would result in a tax decrease for the average taxpayer; nationwide it would yield the average household a tax cut of more than $500. 
<p>	In addition, a flat tax of 20 percent -- which is the initial rate under the Armey-Shelby plan -- would be revenue neutral, adding nothing to the deficit. According to Beach and Mitchell, reductions in individual income taxes would be offset by increases in corporate taxes (in the belief that business income should be taxed only once, at the corporate rather than individual level).
<p>	To ensure accuracy, the Heritage analysis was based on actual tax records contained in the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the latest year for which data are available. The Public Use File is a statistically accurate sample (155,000 returns) of all individual income-tax returns for a given year.
<p>	"The evidence shows that those who say a flat tax would make Americans pay more haven't looked at the numbers," Beach says.

<h2> NATO MUST REFOCUS OR RISK
DEMISE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, FEB. 6, 1996</b> -- The NATO security alliance that protected Europe from Soviet attack during the Cold War is veering so far from its original mission that it may not survive, according to a defense expert at The Heritage Foundation.
<P>
	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1067.html">paper</a> released today, Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen says NATO's recent foray into "peacekeeping" in Bosnia -- a country not even part of the alliance -- is just the latest example of how NATO is losing sight of its original reason for existence: protecting Europe against domination by a hostile power or bloc of powers.
<P>
	"Who is to say whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe 10 or 20 years from now?" he asks. "It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest in the basic security of Europe."
<p>	To ensure NATO remains a bulwark against threats to Europe's security, Hillen recommends that Congress consider a "NATO Revitalization Act" that would do four things: explain to the American people why U.S. involvement in NATO is vital; define the U.S. role in the alliance as limited to deterring aggression; clarify when U.S. military force should be used; and call for the quick expansion of NATO to include the newly democratized Central European countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.	
<p>	The fact that Europe faces no immediate threat is no argument for expanding the alliance's role, Hillen says. After all, NATO is an insurance policy, designed to protect against catastrophe no matter how remote the threat might be. "It is far better to have 100,000 troops deployed peaceably now than have to commit a million troops later to fight a war," he says.
<p>	Besides, Hillen says, the United States is already involved in an organization designed to handle lower-level security tasks such as peacekeeping, and it is not NATO. The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors sanctions and leads observer missions in the former Yugoslavia and other countries. And while it is true that the OSCE has proven incompetent at dealing with problems like Bosnia, NATO nevertheless should not be thrust into missions for which it is poorly suited.
<p>	But once NATO decides to act, Hillen says, the U.S. role must be clearly defined to promote a sensible "division of labor" with America's allies. He says U.S. forces should be deployed only when they can make a unique contribution -- one no other country is able to make -- and when they can produce a decisive victory. In this way, America can ensure that its military role is limited to serving NATO's core mission of "collective defense" (protecting Europe against hostile domination) and not "collective security" (peacekeeping, nation-building and other humanitarian missions).
<p>	To drift from this core mission in search of new roles for NATO would not only create rifts between NATO members over whose troops should serve in peacekeeping operations, but would diminish support for NATO from an American public that questions why the United States should be the world's policeman.
<p>	By contrast, expanding NATO to include new democracies in Central Europe would strengthen the alliance and "bring a level of stability and security ... that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history." The only obstacle to such expansion, he says, is the Clinton administration, which fears Russia opposition. 
<p>	"NATO needs to get back to basics," Hillen concludes. "In the absence of a clear and present danger to Europe it has lost its focus. ... A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe."

<h2>U.S. PEACEKEEPING MISSION TO GOLAN
HEIGHTS ILL-CONSIDERED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>


	WASHINGTON, JAN. 30, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration's plan to launch a "peacekeeping" mission to the Golan Heights once Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement would place both U.S. troops and Israel itself at considerable risk, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1066.html">new paper</a> by foreign-policy experts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>. 
<p>	A U.S. presence in the strategic buffer zone between Israel and Syria would be a double-edged sword, say Heritage Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies Thomas Moore and Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a>.  Not only would U.S. troops face possible attacks from terrorist groups in the area, but Israel's ability to defend itself could be diminished. 
<p>	The analysts urge Congress to hold hearings immediately on the costs and benefits of embroiling the United States in a Golan peacekeeping mission.  They say U.S. negotiators trying to broker an agreement between the two countries should not promise foreign aid to Syria as an enticement to reach peace.  And even if a deal is reached, under no circumstances should American troops participate in a peacekeeping force.  "The United States cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit," they say.  
<p>	Moore and Phillips argue U.S. troops in the Golan Heights would be prime targets for terrorist groups based in nearby Lebanon, such as Hezbollah.  Just as Syria's strongman Hafez al-Assad supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut), so too might he pursue a similar strategy in the Golan to drive U.S. troops from the area. And even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, the analysts say, nothing would prevent Iran, Iraq or Libya from sponsoring terrorism against U.S. troops on their own.
<p>	In addition, a U.S. presence on the Golan would effectively halt Israel's ability to respond with force to attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists or from Syria itself.  "Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria," the analysts say.  Since American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked, "the real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts," they say.
<P>	Moore and Phillips also say a U.S. presence in a Golan peacekeeping mission is not needed.  "Other countries are willing and able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces," they note. Peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland and Poland have been stationed on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, making U.S. participation in any future peacekeeping force unnecessary, they say.
<p>	But if U.S. troops are dispatched to the Golan, their situation would be far more precarious than that of the U.S. peacekeepers stationed along the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula.  In the Sinai, where U.S. troops have been since 1982, a broad desert separates two sides that are allies of the United States and at peace with each other.  In the Golan, U.S. troops would be confined to a much smaller area flanked by the large armored forces of two avowed enemies.
<p>	Any peacekeeping mission to the Golan also would divert critically needed  U.S. forces, the analysts say. A credible long-term Golan peacekeeping mission would likely require three brigades, or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength.  That is a "prohibitively high" burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission, one that could place the United States in jeopardy if conflict arises in Korea, the Persian Gulf or any other place where vital U.S. national interests are at stake, Moore and Phillips say.
<p>	Citing these and other concerns, the analysts say congressional hearings are imperative. They note in both Haiti and Bosnia, swift action by the Clinton administration to send troops stifled congressional debate.  This time, Congress must address the peacekeeping issue before the negotiators reach a deal, or risk receiving another "diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>" from the White House.
<p>	"The United States should not jeopardize important national security interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic," the analysts conclude.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE CAN BE EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST AMERICA'S SOCIAL ILLS, STUDY FINDS</h2></center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 25, 1996</b> -- As Washington policy-makers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">paper</a> released today, <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems. Religion, the majority of studies conclude, "is the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation," according to Fagan, the William H. G. FitzGerald fellow.
<p>	Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgment; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime and divorce. 
<p>	"Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in large part, determined by its religious roots. Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences," Fagan says.
<p>	He cites "Middletown," a classic sociological research project that studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1980s. The study  found that "church-going members were more likely to be married, remain married, and to be highly satisfied with their marriages." 
<p>	Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that "84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families." The same study also indicated that "parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance."
<p>	Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that  religious belief and practice  encourage optimism among socially at-risk children. Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression. 
<p>	Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policy-makers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation. "Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policy-makers," he says.
<p>	Fagan offers several steps that both Congress and the president can take to encourage religious practice. Among them:
<p><ul>
	<li> Congress should initiate a national discussion on the need to restore the  role of religion in American life. "The Senate used to be the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It should take up that role again and discuss the relationship between the practice of religion and the health of the nation,"  Fagan says. 
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that census data on the extent of religious practice can also help inform the public debate on America's most difficult social problems.  Such a resolution would also remove the excuse that it is not permissible to fund research on the  religious aspect of American life. 
	<p>
<li> The president should appoint judges who are at least more sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Fagan says it weakens society and makes no sense to crowd religion out of every activity in which government is involved. "All future candidates for federal court appointments  should be asked to clarify their views regarding both the role of religion in politics and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue," Fagan says.  
</ul><p>	While the study discusses  the role the nation's policy-makers should play in encouraging religious practice, it also spells out actions that America's religious leaders and individual citizens can take.
<p>	Fagan says religious leaders must draw attention to the foundational role religion plays in supporting families and schools. He says religious individuals need to emphasize the need for religious training in adolescents who are most at risk of losing their anchoring in the community and turning to crime, drugs or other social ills.
<P>	"Social research demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It offers a powerful answer to many of the nation's most serious social problems. The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation," Fagan says.

<hr><h2>RUSSIAN CONTROL OF OIL-RICH REGIONS KEY
TO CHECHEN CONFLICT, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 23, 1996</b> -- Overlooked in the current conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya is the larger Russian goal of dominating the oil-rich states of the former Soviet Union, according to a new <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1065.html">Heritage Foundation paper</a>.  
<p>	The Chechen conflict is just one of many efforts by Russia to create a sphere of influence in the strategic regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>.  If Russia succeeds, he says, it could establish a monopoly over the region's vast oil supply (estimated at 25 million barrels, larger than reserves in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined) and drive up energy prices across the globe.
<p>	The U.S. response, Cohen says, must be to ensure that all interested parties, including American oil companies, have free and fair access to the region's oil fields.  The United States can do this in a number of ways, principally by working to preserve the economic independence of former Soviet republics in the region -- such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- and by opposing any efforts of the Russian military to control the oil fields and pipelines through force.
<p>	In a worst-case scenario, Cohen says, Moscow would grab full control of the oil fields, increasing Western energy dependence on a country that has not always been friendly toward the West.  Disturbingly, Russia is already setting up military bases in the region -- four in Georgia and three in Armenia -- to cement its control over all future oil pipelines built in the region.  Such a strategy has support in Russia not only from ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but from the powerful military and "security services."  Cohen describes the intent of these factions bluntly: "The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control."  If Russia dominates this vital region, Cohen even sees the possibility of a Russian alliance with anti-Western regimes Iran, Iraq and Lybia to drive up the price of oil.  
<p>	Cohen says the challenge for the United States is to convince Russia that its national interest lies not in a confrontation with the West over oil, but in cooperation with the West to develop the economic potential of the oil-rich region.  The United States should reassure Moscow that Russian companies, which currently lack the resources to tap the oil, will nevertheless be included in any future ventures.  In this way, Cohen says, Russia will get the economic help it needs from the West, and the West will get the assurance of stability in the region.

<h2>POLICY REVIEW MAGAZINE WILL GREET 1996 
WITH NEW MISSION, FORMAT, FREQUENCY</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 1, 1995</b> -- As Americans debate how to rebuild their communities in the wake of a receding federal government, one of conservatism's most influential voices is charting a new course for reinvigorating private-sector and local government alternatives to the centralized welfare state. The Heritage Foundation's flagship magazine, <i>Policy Review</i>, is redefining its mission to articulate and advance the conservative vision of "civil society."
<p>
	Beginning with the <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html">January/February 1996</a> issue, the magazine, renamed <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, will feature new departments with a new design and appear six rather than four times a year. <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, the magazine's editor for 12 years, plans to make <i>Policy Review</i> a clearinghouse of information and analysis about civic leaders who are solving America's most pressing social and cultural problems without relying on the federal government. "The central challenge for conservatives over the next 20 years is to restore the tradition of American citizenship by rebuilding the institutions of civil society -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, schools, civic associations, businesses, and local governments," Meyerson explains. 
<p>	The new format builds on one of the current magazine strengths: its long-time focus on stories that show the failures of big-government liberalism and illustrate the successes of private and local government initiative. "By becoming Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship, we are simply clarifying our mission, improving our product by building on what we already do best," says Heritage Foundation President and Policy Review Publisher <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner Jr</a>.
<p>	The magazine seeks to make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of society. "Unlike liberals who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives see religious fervor as one of the most important engines of civil society," says Deputy Editor Joe Loconte. The new Policy Review will feature a regular department, "One Nation Under God," which will show the involvement of religious institutions in repairing America's social fabric.
<p>	Unlike liberals, conservatives also see business as an essential part of the citizenship movement. Frequently the most creative answers to social problems come from businesses that can profit by solving them. Another new department, called "The Blessings of Liberty," will show how economic freedom and marketplace competition contribute to civil society.
<p>	The new Policy Review will feature several other regular departments as well. "Home Front" will identify character-building organizations that promote responsible parenthood. "We the People" will tell about remarkable acts of generosity by ordinary people and community institutions. "Abuses and Usurpations" will show how federal and state executive agencies, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions. <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/tsquare.html">"Town Square"</a> will provide news about the best books, papers, and seminars that promote citizenship. And "Profiles in Citizenship" will look at Americans who have built great civic institutions in the past.
<p>	The January/February issue features a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">symposium with presidential candidates</a> Robert Dole, Phil Gramm, Richard Lugar, Lamar Alexander, and Robert Dornan. Candidates respond to the question, "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" The answers are as varied as the candidates themselves: Dole on "The Establishment Clause"; Gramm on "The Takings Clause"; Lugar on "Enumerated Powers"; Alexander on "Presidential Powers"; and Dornan on "Government by Judiciary."
<p>	Also in this issue, former Attorney General and Heritage Ronald Reagan Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> and special counsel Rhett DeHart show "How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff" in their article about the bipartisan assault on local law enforcement. Meese and DeHart urge national lawmakers to resist the temptation to make ordinary crime a federal issue. They argue that nationalizing crime contradicts constitutional principles, incurs unnecessary expense, and does not allow for states to experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention of crime.
<p>	"Can Congress Revive Civil Society?" Yes, says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Along with William J. Bennett, Coats has introduced the "Project for American Renewal" -- comprised of 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. In this article, Coats details his plan and Gertrude Himmelfarb, Don Eberly, and David Boaz offer their comments.
<p>	In "Clinton's AmeriCorps Values," John Walters of The New Citizenship Project says President Clinton's citizenship is defined  "with subsidies, centralized government, and self-esteem." While Clinton incorporates a message of personal responsibility and citizenship into his rhetoric, his vision is "deeply flawed," says Walters. The president has sought justify his efforts to expand the welfare state and to reinvigorate civic life by trying to re-legitimize government. Walters points to Clinton's AmeriCorps program, which uses federal resources to promote voluntarism and "contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Walters asserts that Americans should revitalize citizenship by getting the federal government out of the areas of public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. 
<p>	Articles by Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and others appear in the January/February issue as well.
<p>	 Policy Review began publishing in 1977 and now has a paid circulation of 30,000. It is indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the Public Affairs Information Service, and the Social Sciences Index. The full text of the magazine is available on NEXIS and on the "Internet" at <a href="/heritage/">http://www.heritage.org</a>.
<p>	A one-year <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">subscription</a> to the magazine costs $19.95; two-years costs $34.95. To subscribe, call 1-800-304-0056.

<P>
<I>&quot;The 'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an important
benchmark for evaluating Hong Kong's future success after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 1995</B> -- Hong Kong's economy has been
rated as the freest in the world by the prestigious American research
institute The Heritage Foundation. 
<P>
 The economies of just 10 other countries -- three from the Asia-Pacific
region -- also were rated as &quot;free&quot; in the Washington-based
think tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy in the
world. New Zealand tied for fourth place. And the Republic of
China on Taiwan tied for eighth. Japan, whose economy was in the
&quot;mostly free&quot; category, was 15th (tied with Austria).

<P>
 The economies of Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines also earned ratings
of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 The People's Republic of China (PRC), on the other hand, ranked
near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and the Congo for 121st
place. India's score was only slightly better, and earned India
a tie (with Armenia, Sierra Leone and Yemen) for 117th place.
 
<P>
<I><B>Government House Presentation</B></I>
<P>
 Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr. will present
a copy of the book-length report, &quot;The Index of Economic
Freedom,&quot; to The Honorable Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor,
at ceremonies at Government House today.
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph.D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; would provide &quot;an important benchmark for evaluating
Hong Kong's future success after it reverts to Chinese control
in 1997.&quot;
<P>
 Hong Kong was characterized in the report as &quot;one of the
most accessible markets in the world,&quot; with &quot;very few&quot;
barriers to imports and &quot;virtually no barriers to foreign
investors.&quot; In addition, the authors wrote, &quot;The government
does not interfere in the marketplace; taxes are low and predictable;
government spending increases are closely linked to economic growth&quot;;
and regulations are &quot;applied uniformly and consistently.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
in the think tank's annual survey of economic freedom, while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told,
the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or
&quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of
&quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; In all, 142
countries were rated in the new 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; up from
101 in the previous edition.
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States stood in seventh place in the new 1996 edition
of the &quot;Index.&quot; Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among
former communist countries, the Czech Republic did the best by
far, and was ranked 12th in the world.
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of
Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, vice president of The Heritage Foundation, said,
&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces
economic prosperity. No amount of American aid can alter this
basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>

<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul>

<I>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic
freedom produces economic prosperity. No
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>

<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- Just 10 other countries around
the world provide businesses and individuals with a degree of
economic freedom similar to America's, The Heritage Foundation
reported today in its annual survey of global economic freedom.
The economies of 142 countries were rated, up from 101 countries
a year ago.
<P>
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the
Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings on
Heritage's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while
Cuba, Iraq, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All
told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; Each country
was rated on 10 economic factors: banking, foreign investment,
monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies, the size of
its government sector, property rights, regulatory restrictions,
and black- market activity. Countries were given ratings of one
to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Japan ranked 15th, tied with Austria. The
Czech Republic, in 12th place, remained far ahead of any other
former communist country. Estonia, which came the closest to the
Czech Republic, ranked 26th. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide Congress with guidance on
foreign-aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international investment
community. Washington Post economics columnist James T. Glassman
 (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful clues for
investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide which
countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I> </I>magazine
(June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some surprising
insights on why some markets may be chained to the ground while
others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of Commerce Publisher
Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson to be drawn from
this survey is clear. The more economic freedom people are allowed,
the less interference there is from government, the faster the
nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors --
including political stability, market size, external debt, infrastructure,
currency convertibility, and domestic savings -- to those countries
whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot; had improved most
during the past year. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when Congress debated foreign-aid reform. The House and Senate
both included language in the &quot;foreign operations&quot; appropriations
bill requiring the Agency for International Development (AID)
to report to Congress annually on the relative economic freedom
and prosperity of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid.  
<P>

<P>
<I>&quot;Economic assistance  is wasted when it is given to
countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary for countries with free economies.&quot;-- </i>Co-authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy
<P>
<P>
Johnson and Sheehy, co-authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic assistance is wasted when
it is given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of economic aid alike, such
'assistance' is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided an estimated $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. The recipients of the largest
amounts of aid, in addition to Israel and Egypt -- which, for
geopolitical reasons, receive a combined $5 billion per year --
are almost all countries with unfree economies.
<P>
 &quot;Most economic development aid is wasted; it is money down
the drain. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; Holmes said.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Cuba and Ukraine
are not poor because the people in the West don't share their
riches. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive
economic policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation
of wealth. 
<P>
 &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom
of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free
market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president said, &quot;will
true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything
short of this is not only economically unwise, but is cynically
cruel.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment projects and continued reliance
on price controls.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.

<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolished its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
&quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries
in sub-Saharan Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland,
Benin and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

<P><P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of 13 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today.
<P>
 Just 11 countries in the world received ratings of &quot;free,&quot;
none in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean.
<P>
 The Bahamas, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago
received the best ratings in the region on the influential think
tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; Haiti and
Cuba received the worst ratings, the only two economies in the
region characterized as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told, the
economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Among the former communist countries, the
Czech Republic received the best score and was ranked 12th overall
(tied with the Bahamas and Canada). 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Regional Data</B></I>
<P>
 The Bahamas' economy earned a score of 2.0, putting it just over
the line separating the countries with totally free (a score of
1.0 to 1.99) and &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99).
Panama earned a score of 2.4. Chile and El Salvador scored 2.45.
And Trinidad and Tobago scored 2.5. 
<P>
 Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean whose economies
were rated as &quot;mostly free&quot; were Argentina (2.65), Paraguay
(2.65), Belize (2.7), Jamaica (2.7), Bolivia (2.75), Costa Rica
(2.8), Uruguay (2.8), and Guatemala (2.85). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were Barbados (3.0), Colombia (3.0), Peru (3.0),
Ecuador (3.15), Honduras (3.15), Mexico (3.35), Guyana (3.4),
Brazil (3.45), Dominican Republic (3.45), Venezuela (3.5), and
Nicaragua (3.6). Haiti (4.2) and Cuba (5.0) were the only two
countries in the region whose economies were characterized as
&quot;repressed.&quot;

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of just five
countries in sub-Saharan Africa received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today. Of the 11 countries in the
world with ratings of &quot;free,&quot; none was in sub-Saharan
Africa.
<P>
 Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin and Zambia received the best
ratings in the region on the influential think tank's annual &quot;Index
of Economic Freedom.&quot; Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire, Angola and
Somalia received the worst ratings, with their economies characterized
as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of its economic-liberalization policies, Botswana
was identified as one of a handful of countries around the world
that stood out as a possible future investment prospect.
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. 
<P>
 All told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, five countries received &quot;mostly free&quot;
ratings, 23 received ratings of &quot;mostly unfree,&quot; and
five received ratings of &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom, which tied
for eighth place. 
<P>
 Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received
the best score and was ranked 12th overall, tied with the Bahamas
and Canada. Like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
also received ratings of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa 
<P>
 The economy of Botswana earned a score of 2.8, the best in the
region and 47th overall (tied with Costa Rica). Other African
countries with &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99)
included Uganda (2.83), Swaziland (2.9), Benin (2.95) and Zambia
(2.95). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were South Africa (3.0), Kenya (3.05), Gabon (3.06),
Mali (3.1), Ghana (3.2), Ivory Coast (3.25), Nigeria (3.25), Guinea
(3.35), Madagascar (3.35), Malawai (3.4), Senegal (3.4), Cape
Verde (3.44), Tanzania (3.45), Cameroon (3.6), Ethiopia (3.6),
Lesotho (3.65), Burkina Faso (3.7), Niger (3.7), Zimbabwe (3.7),
Sierra Leone (3.75), Congo (3.8), Mauritania (3.8) and Suriname
(3.9).  
<P>
 Points to Hong Kong 
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a Nov. 27 speech in Hong Kong, Holmes pointed out that 30
years ago Hong Kong and Gabon were equally poor countries, with
per-capita incomes of $2,279 per year and $2,770 respectively.
Hong Kong then pursued a bold economic liberalization program,
while Gabon's government pursued the opposite course. Today, the
average per capita income in Hong Kong is $10,223. The average
in Gabon: just $3,502.
<P>
 &quot;Hong Kong's economic miracle should provide a lesson to
the less-developed world,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;You don't need
gold and silver deposits, or oil wells, or rich, arable land,
or American foreign aid to create wealth and prosperity. All you
need is a climate of economic freedom.&quot;
<P>
 Resource for Investors 
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;
as an investment tool, the authors applied nine additional investment
factors to those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored the best. While some of the 24 countries are
rated as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 Foreign-Aid Reform 
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
 <i>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic 
freedom produces economic prosperity. No 
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</i> 
-- Kim Holmes, Vice President, The Heritage Foundation 
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted when it is
given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign aid alike, economic
aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic development
assistance is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and
it certainly doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a
highly regarded foreign-policy specialist.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti and Cuba  are not
poor because the people in the West don't share their riches.
They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic
policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation of wealth,&quot;
Holmes said. &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic
freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of
the free market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president
said, &quot;will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the
world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise,
but is cynically cruel.&quot;
<P>
 Highlights 
<P>
 The authors of the Heritage Foundation  report made a number
of important observations. They found, for example:
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide, however; its
overall average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that
Panama's improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized
its money supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve
system and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency.
As a result, the Panamanian government can no longer print money
for political purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in the Latin America/Caribbean region and one of the
three most repressed in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.

<h2>CLINTON'S FAMILY TAX CUT DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>


<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 11, 1995 --</b> President Clinton's budget plan,
released last week, would give much less tax relief to low-income
working families than the congressional plan he recently vetoed,
according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation. This finding
directly contradicts the president's claim that his budget would
be better for these families.         
<P>
Overall, Clinton's tax credit denies any tax relief to 10.4 million
working families that would receive relief under the plan he vetoed,
according to Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal
budgetary affairs. In other families, some children wouldn't qualify
for tax relief under Clinton's plan, but would qualify under Congress'
plan. 
<P>
Taken together, the Clinton plan would deny $15 billion in tax
relief to 23 million children who would qualify for it under Congress'
$500-per-child tax-credit plan.
<P>
Particularly hard hit are lower-income working families. In order
to claim the  Clinton tax cut, low-income families must first
reduce their tax bills by the amount of their Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) subsidy. Thus, 5.4 million families earning less
than $30,000 would be denied tax relief under Clinton's plan;
they would get $2.3 billion in tax relief under the plan he vetoed.
A typical single parent with one child, earning below $30,000,
would receive almost $200 less in tax relief each year under the
Clinton plan.
<P>
In addition, Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit does not apply
to children more than 12 years of age. Since roughly 25 percent
of all children are more than age 12, millions of families will
be denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising a child becomes
most expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to families
of at least 2.8 million children earning less than $30,000 per
year. In fact, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton
plan is $442, the average tax cut under Congress' plan is $856
per family.
<P>
&quot;This is bait-and-switch tax policy,&quot; says Hodge. &quot;Clinton
says he is helping lower-wage families with children more than
Congress is, but that is absolutely untrue. The fine print in
his plan denies tax relief to millions of families who are being
told by the White House that they qualify.&quot;

<h2>CAPITAL
GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BENEFIT LOWER, MIDDLE CLASS MOST, HERITAGE
STUDY FINDS</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 6, 1995 --</b> Contrary to what opponents
say, the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax rate -- as
proposed in Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995 --would go mostly
to lower- and middle-income taxpayers, a Heritage Foundation analyst
said today. 
<P>&quot;The typical household declaring a capital gain
had income from sources other than capital gains of $58,729 and
realized a gain of about $973,&quot; according to William Beach,
a visiting fellow in tax analysis at Heritage. &quot;This is hardly
what anyone would consider 'rich,'&quot; he says. In fact, Beach
says, more than 50 percent of the benefits from cutting the capital
gains tax would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income
taxpayers. 
<P>Beach's findings are based on an analysis of 1991 tax
returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal
Revenue Service. 
<P>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would permit
individual taxpayers to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains
from taxation. That exclusion effectively cuts the tax rate on
capital gains in half. 
<P>For corporations, the act decreases the
capital gains rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent.
  Furthermore, Beach says when critics claim that capital gains
go mainly to the wealthy, they often mislead the public by including
the gain as part of a person's income. For example, a retiree
living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000
capital gain one year from selling his house is classified &quot;as
a person with a $42,000 income who received a capital gain.&quot;
&quot;This sleight of hand allows opponents to 'fudge' the number
of rich in their favor,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>According to Beach,
a balanced budget and a lower capital gains tax rate will stimulate
economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code and increase
federal revenue by encouraging individuals to take gains they
might not otherwise take because of a high tax rate. He points
to the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model -- one  of the
nation's most independent and respected models of the U.S. economy
-- which found that balancing the budget with tax cuts would produce
immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing
in long-term economic activity. 
<P>Other leading private economic
firms (Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, DRI/McGraw-Hill
and others) predicted that balancing the budget and cutting taxes
would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more
spendable household income. &quot;This, more than any other factor,
helps poor and middle-class Americans,&quot; Beach points out.
<P>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model
developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer and Associates to
analyze the impact of a balanced budget plan. The model found
that over a seven-year period (1996-2002), most of the economic
benefits of the plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
The model predicted a loss of more than $80.2 billion in potential
gross domestic product, higher unemployment rates and slower household
income growth if the capital gains tax rate remains the same.
<P> Finally, Beach says that experience over the past 25 years shows
that rate decreases lead to more declarations of capital gains
and therefore more revenue from capital gains taxes. &quot;Owners
of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on
to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the
rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up,&quot; he
says. &quot;In other words, you can lower the rate and increase
revenue,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>Economists estimate that Americans
are holding trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains.
&quot;Lowering the capital gains rate could produce substantial
economic benefits and create  revenue windfalls for federal and
state governments as well as average Americans,&quot; Beach says.

<h2>SINGAPORE ONE OF JUST 11 COUNTRIES WITH FREE ECONOMIES, SAYS 1996 &quot;INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM&quot;</h2>
<i>Ranks Second Overall, Ahead of U.S., Britain, Japan</i>
</center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<P>




 <B>SINGAPORE, DEC. 4, 1995</B> -- Singapore has the second-freest
economy in the world, the prestigious American research institute,
The Heritage Foundation, reported today in its annual survey of
global economic freedom.
<P>
 Singapore &quot;has made remarkable [economic] progress by maintaining
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business
regulatory system; political stability; an efficient, strike-free
labor force and tax incentives for foreign investors,&quot; the
report said. Singapore's &quot;average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent,&quot;
it maintains &quot;no import quotas and non-tariff barriers to
foreign trade&quot; and investment laws &quot;are clear and fair
and pose few problems for businesses.&quot; 
<P>
 Just 10 other countries around the world provide businesses and
individuals with a degree of economic freedom similar to Singapore's,
the Washington-based think tank said in its 1996 &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 The report was released Nov. 27 in Hong Kong. It was presented
to leaders of Singapore's business community at a luncheon today
at Traders Hotel. 
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. The economies
of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind Switzerland, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. 
<P>
 Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among former communist countries,
the Czech Republic scored the best: in 12th place (tied with the
Bahamas and Canada).
<P>
 In addition to Japan, other Asian and Pacific Basin countries
whose economies received ratings of &quot;mostly free&quot; were
 Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia and the Philippines.
<P>
 In all, 142 countries were rated in the new 1996 edition, compared
to 101 countries in the previous edition. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And New York Journal
of Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries are rated
as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds of
destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the &quot;free&quot;
to &quot;mostly free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased
banking regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul><P>
 Heritage Foundation Vice President Kim Holmes said that &quot;The
'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an especially important benchmark
for evaluating the future success of Hong Kong after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997. Any backsliding will obviously be
noted.&quot;
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With better banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; six were in Africa.</ul><p>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1995</b> -- The U.S. delegation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting this weekend in Japan should work to revive the group's commitment to free trade in the region, which is being seriously undermined by the protectionist policies of Japan and China, according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	Leaders from Asia and the Americas will meet under the auspices of APEC, an organization of Asia and Pacific Rim countries that have pledged to create free trade in the Asia and Pacific Rim by 2020.  President Clinton is expected to attend the meeting if  the budget battle with Congress does not keep him in Washington.<P>
	According to Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Robert O'Quinn, author of the study, 	 Japan's proposal to allow APEC nations to exempt "sensitive economic sectors" like agriculture from free trade is an ominous sign for the future of APEC. "The proposal has become a flash point, dividing APEC into two warring camps. On one side are Japan and China, who want exemptions; on the other side are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, who oppose exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization," O'Quinn says.<P>   
	At the meeting, the U.S. delegation should:<P>

<ul><li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that selective exemptions to trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national interests. "Once one member is permitted to exempt a sensitive sector of their economy, other members will follow suit with their own protectionist demands," O'Quinn warns.
	<P><LI> Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand to block Japan's protectionist proposal. O'Quinn says the United States has some leverage here because most other APEC members disagree with Japan's protectionist approach. "The key will be to forge a consensus," says O'Quinn.   
	<P><li>Stress that blocking or delaying comprehensive trade liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. "Backsliding on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization," O'Quinn warns.</ul>
	<P>The importance of APEC to the U.S. economy is illustrated in a related paper by Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Dori. For example, Dori says, "in 1994, U.S. exports to East Asia and the Pacific Rim totaled more than $150 billion. More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans." He says that in 1994, more than three million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.<P>

<center><h3>ATR'S Congressional Leadership Daily Update</h3></center>
<b>MEMO</b><br>
DATE:  November 24, 1995<br>
TO:  Taxpayer Activists and Radio Talk Show Hosts<br>
FROM:  Grover G. Norquist<br>
RE:  Balanced Budget and Lower Taxes or Status Quo<p>
<hr>
<P>
The present debate in Washington will decide whether America moves to a balanced budget with lower taxes, or continues the status quo of high debt, increasing deficits and government spending.
<P>
So that every taxpayer activist can be fully informed about the daily shifting tactical issues of debt ceiling limits, continuing resolutions and the budget reconcialiation budget, ATR is hosting a daily conference call at 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.  We will be joined by Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, or a key staffer for a daily briefing.
<P>
Please join us by calling <b>1-703-736-7238</b> and tell the operator that you are calling in for the Americans for Tax Reform's Congressional Leadership Daily Update.
<P><center><b>Daily Conference Call<br>
<h1><center>House Speaker Newt Gingrich</center></h1>
<b>Live at 5pm Eastern Time</b>, - Replayed at 6pm & 7pm<br>
The call will last about 15 minutes.<br></b>
</h3></center>
Share this notice and the phone number with other activists in your state.  The better informed our side is, the more effectively we can promote the fight for lower taxes and a balanced budget.
<P>
Our goal over the next two months will not change:  a balanced budget by 2002 with tax cuts, but the tactics of the White House and the advocates of the status quo necessitate our being up to date in the back and forth of the daily tactical fights.
<P>
Onward.  We're winning.

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 13, 1995</b> -- Families would gain $32 billion in real disposable income over seven years, wages would increase faster and first-time home buyers would spend less on new mortgages if the congressional plan to cut taxes and balance the federal budget is approved, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/beach.html">Heritage Foundation computer model study</a>.
	<P>"Over the next seven years, Congress's budget plan would lead to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth," Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says in the study, which is based on one of the same econometric models of the U.S. economy used by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Board and other government bodies. Beach testified about the study today before a House Republican Policy Committee hearing on how the congressional budget reconciliation bill will affect the economy.
	<P>"Critics of balancing the budget by 2002 and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession," Beach says. "But this study shows that not only does no recession result at any time during the seven-year period, but the economy grows faster with these proposed budget changes than it would without them."
	<P> Beach says when lower federal taxes and a balanced federal budget are fed through the econometric model, developed by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, the result is higher household spending, lower interest rates, increased productivity, greater capital investment, and less inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<P>
	Housing starts and investment in new business machinery would increase by 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, the study says. The computer segment of business durable equipment purchases would increase 2.9 percent, compared to current policy.
	<P>The study projects a slightly higher unemployment rate under the balanced-budget plan, due chiefly to a loss of public-sector jobs and lowered government demand for goods and services. The study notes, however, that its assumptions do not include action by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and thus create additional private-sector employment growth to absorb former public-sector workers.
<P>	Beach says the study's results may surprise both supporters and opponents of the congressional reconciliation package. "Supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately, but the study indicates that the primary effect of balancing the budget is a steady, long-term improvement in the economy, not a short-term boost. Congress also would need to enact major reforms of the tax code to spur the very large level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict."
	<P>Opponents of the reconciliation bill "should take comfort in the likelihood that the plan will not undermine economic growth, and will lower interest rates and inflation," Beach says.<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">JACK KEMP<BR>

<P>
<br>
Jack Kemp currently is on leave
of absence as co-director of Empower America, a public policy
and advocacy organization he co-founded in 1993 with William Bennett,
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. Empower America is
dedicated to three founding principles: expanding freedom and
democratic capitalism; promoting policies to expand economic growth
and entrepreneurship for our nation; and advancing social policies
which empower people, not government bureaucracies.<BR>
<P>
Prior to founding Empower America,
Mr. Kemp served for four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, and proved to be one of our nation's most innovative
leaders in that role. He was the first and strongest advocate
of Enterprise Zones to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation
in urban America and of expanding homeownership among the poor
through resident management and ownership of public housing.<BR>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Senator Bob Dole
and Speaker Newt Gingrich put Jack Kemp at the center of the tax
and economic debate for the `96 campaign by naming him chairman
of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to
study how major restructuring of our tax code can help unleash
the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow the economy without
inflation and create opportunity for people to escape poverty.
<BR>
<P>
 Before his appointment to the Cabinet,
Mr. Kemp represented the Buffalo area and Western New York for
18 years in the United States House of Representatives from 1971
to 1989.  He served for seven years in the Republican Leadership
as Chairman of the House Republican Leadership Conference.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
 Jack Kemp came to Congress after
13 years as a professional football quarterback.  He was captain
of the San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1962 and also of the Buffalo
Bills, the team he helped lead to the American Football League
championship in 1964 and 1965 when he was named the league's most
valuable player. He also co-founded the AFL Players Association
and was five times elected president.<BR>
<P>
 Mr. Kemp, born and raised in Los
Angeles, is married to the former Joanne Main of Fillmore, California.
 Both Jack and Joanne are graduates of Occidental College. They
have four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James, eleven
grandchildren, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR>

</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h3>JACK KEMP URGES BUDGET 
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO 
STRENGTHEN RECONCILIATION 

</h3><P>October 27, 1995</center><P>Contact: Christian Pinkston, (202) 452-8200, x223<P><hr size=3 width=50%><P>Washington D.C.--Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> today congratulated House and Senate Republicans on their historic achievement in passing budget plans that will reduce the burden of government in the lives of the nation's citizens and improve incentives for savings, investment and families.  Kemp urged congressional leaders to move quickly on a House-Senate package that strengthens these incentives and called on them to seek an accord with the Clinton administration.  Such an agreement, he emphasized, can be accomplished without compromising the integrity of the plan's objectives.
 <p>
"Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and the entire Republican congressional leadership deserve great credit for their masterful job in bringing off this achievement," Kemp said.  "But none of this will matter unless Congress and the White House can find a way to resolve their differences.  This legislation is too important to the nation to be sacrificed in a fit of partisan acrimony and bickering.
                                                                                             <P>
"I would hope that Republicans in Congress and the Democratic Administration recognize that both have a lot at stake in reaching a successful conclusion.  Each should carefully evaluate options that are available.  For example, if the final package has the right mix of incentives, including a substantial capital gains tax cut with inflation indexing, there is no reason the American economy should not experience substantially higher growth with lower inflation.  In that case, the Administration's economic assumptions, though more optimistic than those of Congress, are within the range of consensus forecasts and would be entirely plausible.  The higher growth projections would mean substantially increased revenue estimates, easing the path to budget balance.
<P>
"At the same time, I would urge my former colleagues to tread very carefully before reducing the inflation adjustment for federal benefits and income tax liability.  Several economists have testified to Congress suggesting that the consumer price index overstates inflation.  However, others contend that the CPI has substantially under reported inflation over the past two decades.  It would be unconscionable to require sacrifice from the nation's retirees and taxpayers on the basis of a theoretical economic argument that has yet to be resolved.
<P>
"I would also add that, in my opinion, it is imperative that Congress go all the way toward fundamental change by following up this legislation with approval of the Abraham-Lieberman enterprise zone act. While I applaud the reconciliation bill for cutting taxes for working families and businesses, I believe there is one essential ingredient missing:  a provision to create jobs and opportunity for people who live in America's economically-distressed urban and rural communities.  The Abraham-Lieberman "Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act of 1995" would accomplish this goal by providing tax incentives to work, save, and invest in the over 100 urban and rural pockets of poverty across this Nation.  This legislation is the type of affirmative "effort" for which our party has been known for throughout history--from Lincoln to Reagan.  Furthermore, Republican-led efforts to combat the plight of poverty and unemployment in our inner-cities would begin the needed process of racial and ethnic reconciliation and give hope and opportunity to all people."    <P>

WASHINGTON, DC -- With a warning that trashy daytime talk-shows on television are debasing our aulture and harming America's children, <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joe Lieberman today launched a campaign to rid the airwaves of <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">sordid programs</a>.  Bennett, co-director of Empower America, and Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut, say they will work together and with other concerned citizens to put pressure on those who produce and own daytime television talk shows to get rid of the licentious material that characterizes many of such programs today. To illustrate their point about the condition of daytime television talk shows, Bennett and Lieberman aired a series of clips culled only from shows that aired Monday and Tuesday of this week.
<P>Bennett and Lieberman are not calling for legislation or any govemment censorship of daytime television talk shows. They are calling on the producers and owners of the programs to recognize their responsibility to Amencan society and children by setting higher standards for the programs' content. They are also calling on parents to exercise their respons bllity to simply turn the programs off. Bennett and Lieberman said that hundreds of thousands of young children, and up to a million or more teenagers watch daytime television talk shows on a daily basis.
<P><a href="pr1026a.html">Bennett</a> and <a href="pr1026b.html">Lieberman</a> said the number of trashy talk shows has increased in recent
months, while the behavior exhibited on the shows has sharply declined. They argue that
exposing children, teenagers and even adults to hours of such programming on a daily basis has, over time, a deteriorating effect on the civility of American society, and becomes one                                                                   
more contributing factor to the host of serious problems facing our country today.

<h2>U.S.-Led Missile Defense System Urged for Asia</h2>
<h4>U.S. Critical To Shielding
Asian Allies From China</h4></center><P>


<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>


	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 24, 1995</b> --  America can best protect itself and its Asian allies against growing nuclear threats from China and North Korea by deploying as soon as possible both a national missile defense system for the continental United States, and theater missile defenses to protect U.S. naval and ground forces throughout the Pacific region, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	Congress is currently considering alternative deployment schedules for missile defense systems as part of the 1996 military spending measure. A national missile defense system would intercept enemy missiles aimed at targets within the continental United States, while a theater missile defense system would knock down enemy missiles targeted against American militiary forces operating overseas or against U.S. allies.
<P>	Japan, South Korea and Australia should also be encouraged to buy and field their own American-made theater missile defense systems, while U.S. officials also should pressure China to limit its offensive nuclear missiles in exchange for sharing U.S. missile defense data, says the study's author, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>.
<p>	"A national missile defense system is needed not only to defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail," says Fisher. "The administration can enhance security in Asia by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile attack and extends that umbrella to protect America's allies and friends throughout the region."
<p>	Failure to take these actions risks allowing The People's Republic of China or North Korea to use their own growing offensive missile capabilities to checkmate U.S. military strength in the Pacific region, and to intimidate U.S. allies throughout Asia, as occurred earlier this year when China "in a blatant act of intimidation" tested several of its weapons barely 100 miles from The Republic of China on Taiwan, Fisher says.
<p>	"Armed with nuclear warheads, these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases or naval formations in Asia," Fisher points out. "China is believed to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. By the year 2010, according to one estimate, China could have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States from bases in China," notes Fisher.	China also is developing two new mobile missiles capable of hitting the western United States, and may have hired Russian technicians to aid in producing cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk. China has even bought 60 Russian-made missile interceptors similar to the U.S. Patriot.
<p>	At the same time, North Korea is proceeding with work on its Taepo Dong missiles, which, Fisher says, "would give Pyongyang the capability to target U.S. forces in Guam, and possibly the western half of the continental United States, plus Europe, East Asia and Australia."
<p>	Fisher believes a national missile defense system would protect America's heartland against these emerging Chinese and North Korean  threats,  while theater defenses would provide a shield for U.S. forces stationed throughout the Pacific region and the U.S. allies they are defending. Without a credible U.S. response, America's Asian allies will be forced to seek their own deterrents to such intimidation.
<p>	Both houses of Congress have approved 1996 defense authorization bills that devote more than $3.5 billion to both national and theater missile defense systems, including the "Brilliant Eyes" space-based sensor system used to identify and track enemy missiles. That amount is about $1 billion more than requested by the Clinton administration.
<p>	The bills now in House-Senate conference would accelerate deployment of the two major theater systems -- the Navy's "Upper Tier" system and the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system -- to 1997. By contrast, the Clinton administration has set no official date to begin THAAD deployment, and sought only minimal Upper Tier funding.
<p>	Fisher says U.S. officials should urge U.S. allies in Asia to purchase American theater missile defense systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. "By cooperating with Washington to develop and fund missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries from nuclear missile threats," Fisher says.
<p>	Finally, Fisher recommends that the United States inform China that it must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and should join the Missile Technology Control Regime backed by the United States that limits the export of offensive missile technology. "Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsensal, the United States will make available to China early warning data from U.S.theater missile defense systems," Fisher says.
<p>	These actions must be taken by the United States because it is the only nation with "the technical capability and the moral vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation," Fisher says.

<h2>LABOR DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE 
CLOSED, ANALYST SAYS</h2>

<h4>DOL Responsibilities Should
 Be Turned Over To States</h4></center><p>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 23, 1995</b>  -- To reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations while maintaining employment protections and workplace safety, Congress should abolish the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and shift its legitimate functions to the states, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1058.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> released today.
<p>	"The proliferation of DOL regulations, while failing to make things significantly better for American workers, present a serious barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs," says <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy. "Closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department and shifting virtually all of its functions to the states could save as much as $10.5 billion during the next five years," he says.
<p>	In his comprehensive plan for abolishing the Labor Department, Wilson points out that about 75 percent of the department's current $38.8 billion budget is made up of funding for unemployment insurance and for employment services to the states, with job training constituting another 20 percent. "By turning over responsibility for these programs to the states, Congress could take 95 percent of what the DOL does away from far-away Washington bureaucrats and place responsibility for these tasks in the hands of state governments, which are closer to the real problems," Wilson says. This would enable states "to limit the duration of unemployment benefits, reduce payroll taxes, increase jobs, and try new ways to privatize many of DOL's functions," says Wilson.
<p>	Among the job-training programs for the economically disadvantaged that Wilson says should be consolidated into a single block grant to the states are the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, and Indian and Native American Employment and Training. Wilson says states should be required to focus resources for these programs on job placement and to objectively measure the effectiveness of each.
<p>	All other present DOL-funded job-training programs, he says, could be folded into another block grant, which would include programs for dislocated workers, the School-to-Work and Adult Technology Learning programs, Wilson says. "Even DOL itself has acknowledged that making block grants of these programs would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars," he says.
<p>	Wilson says Congress, as part of the process of dismantling DOL, should repeal outdated labor laws, executive orders and regulations, reform the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It should repeal the executive order for affirmative action and related regulations governing federal contractors and subcontractors, he says.
<p>	Under Wilson's plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau would be shifted to a newly-created sub-Cabinet agency called the Bureau of National Statistics, as proposed earlier this year by The Heritage Foundation in a proposal for reorganizing the federal government and balancing the federal budget.
<p>	At the same time, DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration should be combined, Wilson says, and the newly formed agency made subject to an independent workplace standards-setting board. The new board would "redefine the role of the federal government in workplace safety from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner with the private sector," Wilson says. 
<p>	"Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed dramatically since the days when most of America's labor laws were written and the Labor Department that enforces them was created," says Wilson. "Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions and compensation packages than current law and regulations allow. This means a fundamental rethinking of DOL and federal labor policy is needed."
<p>	"Congress should move aggressively to abolish DOL and reform federal labor law to insure that excessive regulatory burdens are removed, labor market flexibility is increased for workers and businesses alike, and basic workplace safety protections are made more effective," Wilson says.<p><p>

<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION
 SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, OCT. 17, 1995</b> -- The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) should be abolished because it routinely engages in political advocacy and frequently lobbies at taxpayer expense for expanded welfare spending, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html">study</a>  released today.
<p>	Among the causes LSC supports with taxpayer funds are adoption rights for homosexuals, preventing drug dealers' evictions from public housing, racial quotas in higher education and protecting welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, according to the study's authors, Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty, who are, respectively, chairman and president of the Vienna, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center.
<p>	Reforming LSC is not feasible, say Boehm and Flaherty, because it is virtually unaccountable to taxpayers who fund it and beyond effective oversight by either Congress or the president.
<p>	"For the past 30 years, LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through its litigation, advocacy and lobbying, LSC has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending, and helped add millions of people to the welfare rolls," say Boehm and Flaherty. "LSC cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. It should be abolished," they say of the federal corporation that is supposed to help poor people who can't afford to hire an attorney.
	<p>LSC-supported groups have successfully sought countless federal and state court decisions to nullify "moral" conditions connected to welfare benefits such as identifying fathers of illegitimate children, the authors say. Too often, such cases are pursued by LSC-funded groups at the expense of genuine problems facing poor people such as bankruptcy, child-support, custody and guardianship proceedings, landlord controversies, and employment issues, Boehm and Flaherty say.
<p>	At the root of the problem is LSC's legal structure and the unaccountability that structure fosters. Chartered by Congress in 1974 as a independent, private, non-profit corporation,  LSC receives about $400 million in federal funds annually. The way the corporation distributes its money "makes it immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending," say Boehm and Flaherty. 
<p>	The LSC distributes the money it gets from Congress in the form of grants to 323 private lawyers' groups across the country. At the same time, these groups also receive funds (about $225 million annually) from state and local governments, lawyers groups, and other private sources.
<p>	Even though Congress gives LSC millions of federal dollars every year, LSC employees are not considered federal employees under the corporation's federal charter. As a result, LSC's "status as a private corporation exempts it from provisions of the federal criminal code, including the Anti-Deficiency Act that makes it a felony for government workers to misappropriate public money," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Further removing LSC from even minimal scrutiny is the fact that nobody outside of the corporation knows how it spends public funds, since its attorneys keep no time sheets, and it is impossible to judge how well LSC attorneys represent clients because all case records are kept secret under a claim of attorney-client privilege.
<p>	"Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of LSC lawyers, and there are no provisions for waiving the attorney-client privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Taken together, these factors mean "it makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress or on the LSC's governing board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a political agenda that serves the interests of the welfare state and its allies against those of productive taxpayers," contend Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	"Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds given LSC. For the sake of the American taxpayer and for the sake of America's poor, it is time to abolish LSC," Boehm and Flaherty say.

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 16, 1995</b> -- If Medicare is not reformed,  industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors, consumers and taxpayers and $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages to workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis released today.
<p>	The authors of the study, senior fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a> and domestic policy research analysts Christine Olson and Rea Hederman, have included an industry-by-industry analysis showing how much businesses, employees and consumers will have to pay each year as a result of an additional 3.52 percent Medicare payroll tax the program's trustees say will be necessary to finance the current system without reform. 
<P>	Topping the industry list are retail trade, educational services and public administration, which together will shoulder nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the yearly cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers and investors. "Businesses and employees in the retail trade industry alone will pay more than $13.3 billion in extra payroll taxes each year -- with employees picking up more than $12.5 billion of that tab -- if Medicare is not reformed," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	"The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience shows that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation," according to the study. 
<p>	"Without significant reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt," the analysts say. "For Medicare to remain financially solvent and able to pay for hospital care for today's 'baby boomers' when they retire, Congress needs to either find additional money or slow down its rate of spending."

<h2>FLAT TAX EARNS HIGH MARKS 
IN STUDY OF TAX REFORM PLANS</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b><br>
<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 26, 1995</b> -- Of all the tax-reform proposals ready to be considered by Congress, the flat tax proposal sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Selby, R-Ala., received the highest marks in a Heritage Foundation study released today. <p>
	The study, conducted by Heritage economist <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>, McKenna senior fellow in political economy, is aimed at assisting lawmakers, who must decide which of the major tax-reform proposals is best for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. 
<p>	"Tax reform is gaining momentum. The existing income-tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul," Mitchell says. "Of all the plans currently being considered in Congress, the Armey flat tax addresses the most serious problems in the simplest, most straight-forward way."
<p>	The Armey plan would ensure fairness by taxing individuals and businesses with a 17 percent flat rate on all income. The plan, which is based on the model developed by Stanford Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka, would ensure simplicity by allowing taxes to be filed using a postcard-sized return. By contrast, the current income-tax system has more than 400 different forms.
<p>	Mitchell says the flat tax's low rate would encourage economic growth by increasing the value of income-producing assets, such as rental property and investments of all kinds. On the other hand, he says, the flat tax would reduce the incentive to invest in tax shelters, a practice that keeps huge amounts of capital from circulating and producing wealth in the U.S. economy. "With these extra billions in circulation, all Americans will benefit," Mitchell says. 
<p>	The flat tax also would end the practice of using the tax system for social engineering. Mitchell says by removing the progressive component from America's tax structure, the flat tax would stop penalizing economic success. It would encourage savings and investment by taxing income only once, and would significantly reduce the number of preferences and deductions now available under the existing income tax code.
<p>	Another version of the flat tax, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also received high marks from Mitchell. But the Specter proposal seeks a slightly higher rate (20 percent) and would allow for some limited deductions for charitable contributions, including the full deduction for home mortgages. Mitchell says the Specter flat-tax plan is less attractive because it would still allow for government micromanagement of the economy.
<p>	But either way, Mitchell says the time is ripe for reform of the current tax system. "Its complexity forces even the most sophisticated Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms; one study put annual compliance costs at nearly $200 billion." The current system subjects some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, to as many as four different levels of taxation. "For example, under the current tax system, a single dollar of income can be subject to the corporate income tax, the personal income tax, the capital gains tax, and estate taxes," he says. 
<P>	"Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties and deductions," Mitchell says. Such complexity is inevitable in a system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy. Mitchell says the system will never change as long as politicians are able to collect large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code. 
<p>	"While other reform proposals, such as the value added (VAT) tax and the national sales tax, have some advantages, they contained features that more closely resembled the current system, offering little or no improvement over the status quo," he says.

<title>Federal Health Program Success Lesson for Medicare Reform -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM SUCCESS IS LESSON
 FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center><hr>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1995</b> -- Medicare reformers in Congress should heed important lessons on consumer choice and health insurance cost controls demonstrated by the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"The FEHBP has shown a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four-tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent," says Heritage Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a> in a study released today. FEHBP contrasts sharply with the current  Medicare system's 10.5 percent per year average increase. Annual private-sector price increases have averaged 6 percent per year during a comparable period, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers FEHBP.<p>
	House Republicans recently proposed a package of Medicare reforms that "take some modest steps" in directions suggested by Heritage health care experts. But the FEHBP experience ought to provide further policy direction for congressional reformers, Moffit says.
<p>	The vivid contrast between Medicare's spiralling costs and FEHBP's successful cost controls is due to the fact that FEHBP -- which covers nine million members of Congress and their staffs, federal employees, retirees and their families -- holds down premium costs by depending primarily upon consumer choice and competition among about 400 coverage providers, says Moffit.
<p>	Significantly, FEHBP's ability to hold costs down is achieved despite covering what is far from an ideal insurance pool, he says. "Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. The federal workforce is older than the private-sector workforce: the average federal worker is almost 44 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is about 38 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily during the past several years, so that nearly 40 percent of all FEHBP subscribers are retirees," according to Moffit.
   <p>	 By comparison to Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, "FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs," Moffit says.
<p>	Government workers and retirees would have fared even better in FEHBP in recent years if Congress had changed the program to a defined contribution that is indexed to inflation, rather than retaining the current complex formula, Moffit says. The formula is based on the average premiums for the six largest FEHBP insurance providers, with a statutory ceiling of the government's share of premium costs set at 75 percent.
<p>	Converting FEHBP to a defined contribution consisting of "a clearly defined annual dollar amount" with future increases tied to the Consumer Price Index "would give private insurers a powerful incentive for offering attractive packages of benefits at a price equal to or even less than the amount of the government's contribution. This would reduce the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increase their savings even more," says Moffit.
<p> 	In a related study released today, Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> says Congress is now considering Medicare reforms that would set up a system somewhat like FEHBP.  But further reforms are needed to complete the task of creating "a Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs, while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care."
<p>	The most important provision of the House Medicare reform plan, for example, is the Medicare Plus option, which allows seniors to choose a private-sector health plan paid with a government contribution based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors, Butler says.
<p>	But other features of the House plan "raise concerns," according to Butler, including a provision "to use the failed approach of price controls" to limit government Medicare spending. The House plan also makes the "serious mistake" of making Medicare Plus plans cap their deductibles and co-payments at the same level required by the traditional Medicare plan.
<p>	Butler also faults the House plan for requiring Medicare Plus plans to match the benefits offered by the traditional Medicare program. Congress should instead follow FEHBP's statuatory language requiring insurers to provide a basic core of benefits, but otherwise leave them free to group benefits, medical procedures, treatments, and costs in packages as they see fit.
<p>	"These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement," says Butler.

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 22, 1995</b> To end the nation's vulnerability to ballistic-missile attack as quickly as possible, congressional conferees should reject the House version of the defense authorization bill and endorse the Senate bill's "clear, concise and detailed instructions" for deployment of a national missile-defense system in the year 2003, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"Without a specific deployment date and a detailed plan, nothing will be deployed because the Clinton administration -- since it is against erecting missile defenses in the first place -- will use the lack of a timetable to put off deployment indefinitely," according to Heritage Senior Defense Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a>. Because of this factor, Spring says "Congress cannot afford to give the administration much leeway, and the Senate bill doesn't give it."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill includes detailed instructions that are much needed but lacking in the House bill. For example, he says in addition to instructions for National Missile Defenses (NMD), the Senate measure fixes the same starting date for deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD), to protect U.S. allies and forces stationed overseas, and defines the core programs the Pentagon will need to erect both systems.   
<p>	For the NMD system, Spring says, the Senate bill includes instructions for "deploying interceptors at more than one site, establishing both interim and initial deployment dates, and setting forth specific options for upgrading existing radars and streamlining acquisition procedures." For TMD systems, the Senate bill designates as core programs "an upgraded Patriot Missile, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier defense systems and the Army's Theater High-Altitude-Area Defense system." The House version, by contrast, contains no instructions for TMD deployment or requirements.
<p>	"Further, the Senate bill would insure that TMD systems are capable of working together so several systems could be used against the same missile attack," Spring points out. Also, the Senate measure lets TMD systems use data from external sensors, including those based in space, to identify and track targets, and "requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress next year on the options available for augmenting ground-, sea- and space-based defenses." This last requirement, Spring says, "will force the Pentagon to examine the advantages of sea- and space-based over more expensive ground-based defenses."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill takes the proper approach toward the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. "By requiring a comprehensive review of the pact to determine its continuing value and validity," the Senate bill creates an opening for eventually doing away with the ABM treaty, since it was signed with the former Soviet Union, and is often used to make a case against missile defenses.
<p>	On all of these issues, Spring says congressional conferees should "move as quickly as possible; otherwise the nation will remain needlessly vulnerable to ballistic-missile attack."

State And Congressional District</H3>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 20, 1995</B> -- The combined general and payroll tax hike that will be needed to save Medicare -- if Congress doesn't restructure the system -- will increase the tax burden by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years, according to analysts at The Heritage Foundation. The other alternative would be a steep cutback in services.
<P>	The options before Congress are limited, say Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu and David Winston in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">report</a> released today. Congress must either restructure and reform the program along the lines of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which allows consumer choice and market competition to keep health-care prices down, dramatically increase payroll and general taxes on American families and businesses, or drastically cut back on services for the elderly.
<P>	"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already projects that during the next five years Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in general taxes," the Heritage analysts say. On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right now, when you look at the  combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."	
<P>	Yet, the Heritage analysts say transforming Medicare into a health-care program that would work like FEHBP, the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers, "would allow Medicare users to pick government-certified private insurance plans and receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. What Heritage proposes is a far more attractive alternative than strangling American workers and businesses with enormous new taxes," the analysts say.
<P>  	They also warn of the possible effects of such taxation. "Any new payroll tax assessed to shore up Medicare ultimately will be felt by America's working families in the form of reduced wages or compensation and in some cases, even the loss of jobs."
<P>	The Heritage analysts point out that while Congress is focusing mainly on fixing Medicare Part A, it must also deal with Part B in order to come up with a permanent solution for Medicare's financial plight. Again, without a major restructuring of the entire Medicare system, CBO projections indicate that the taxes needed to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.
<P>	The Heritage analysts used 1993 earnings data to compute the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/wel-62mp.html">state-by-state impact</a> of a 3.5 percent payroll tax increase -- the estimated figure needed to achieve long-term actuarial balance for the Medicare system -- on workers throughout the country. They found that if such a payroll tax increase had been in effect in 1993, employees and employers would have faced more than $123 billion in new taxes that year. Under this scenario, wage earners in Wyoming would have faced a total of $101.2 million in additional taxes, the low range, while California wage earners would have paid an additional $7.7 billion.
<P>	Even worse, employees would have suffered more than $115 billion in lost earnings. On average, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would have ranged from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. Similar significant losses were projected throughout the country.
<P>	"No one wants to drastically cut back Medicare services or impose yet another biggest-in-history tax hike on the American people," the Heritage analysts warn. "That's why it's so important that Congress take a serious look at the only viable alternative: restructuring of Medicare along the lines of  market competition and consumer choice."

<H2> FREEING FARMERS WOULD PRODUCE
$135 BILLION BOOST, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>
<h3>State-by-State Analysis
Reveals Billion-Dollar Winners</h3>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19, 1995</b> -- Freeing America's farmers by ending New Deal-era crop subsidies, price supports and land reserves would generate $135 billion in new income distributed throughout all 50 states during the next decade, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	The study  -- based on a computer model of the nation's economy developed by Heritage to measure the impact of ending the federal farm program -- comes as Congress considers reforms of a wide range of agriculture programs.
<p>	"Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use, and generate a $135 billion expansion of the nation's economy," say Heritage Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, co-authors of the Heritage study. "Every state would share in the economic expansion -- even those that are not agriculture producers -- because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products."
<p>	Increased farm production would fuel demand for seed, fertilizer and equipment such as tractors, as well as generate expansion of the food processing, packaging, transportation and shipping industries, the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	Earlier this year, Frydenlund wrote Heritage's comprehensive proposal for agriculture reform, called "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." The Heritage proposal suggests ending the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that keeps more than 36 million acres of farm land idle. This government attempt to control farm prices limits the supply of a wide variety of crops and products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, sugar, peanuts and milk.
<p>	The Heritage plan would phase out CRP over a five-year period, thus freeing U.S. farmers to return the now-idled acres to production to meet worldwide food demand that experts say will triple in coming years.
<p>	"If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict their output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account," Frydenlund and Winston say. In the first year alone, more than $2 billion net additional farm income would result, with the annual total reaching $4 billion by the year 2001, and more than $18 billion annually thereafter.
<p>	In Kansas, for example, farmers (primarily wheat producers) would enjoy a $1 billion boost in the first year, while in Iowa, a leading corn producer, the first-year increase would exceed $800 million. For Texas, a major producer of most farm products, the increase would exceed $1 billion, Frydenlund and Winston say.
<p>	Non-farm states like Rhode Island "would reap large benefits" as a result of increased demand for shipping and transportation services, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they would gain through increased agricultural production," observe Frydenlund and Winston. A state-by-state analysis is included with the study.
<p>	 In a related study to be released later this week, Frydenlund says the sugar, peanut and dairy programs are perfect examples of why reform is needed. All three programs are "beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can fix them," says Frydenlund, because each uses complex systems of quotas and allotments to limit who can produce how much for sale at what price, as well as where it can be grown and where it can be sold.
<p>	The sugar program, for example, "is big government and corporate welfare at its worst. Almost half of the estimated $1.4 billion in federal benefits created by the program go to 1 percent of the sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and a Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone," says Frydenlund.
<p>	"Incremental changes in these programs will not be reform. Instead, Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs by either eliminating or gradually phasing out the quotas and allotments that benefit so few at the expense of consumers," the Heritage analysts say.<p>

<h3>   
<center>TOWN HALL Hosts Bob Dornan Conference On-Line<br>
CompuServe reserves Convention Center for event</center>
</h3>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC, September 18, 1995 -- Town Hall announced today that it will be hosting an on-line conference featuring California Republican Congressman and presidential hopeful, Robert "B-1 Bob" Dornan. The conference will be held in the CompuServe convention center on Friday, September 22, 1995 from 9:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. (EST).  Any CompuServe member can participate by typing CONVENTION at the GO prompt.
<P>
Rep. Dornan will discuss his race for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination and why he believes it so important that the views he holds be openly and strongly discussed in the public arena. These views include tax relief for American families, a Balanced Budget Amendment, the protection of innocent, pre-born children, school choice and school prayer, a strong national defense and immigration reform.
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dornan's views are often attacked by the national
media as "extremist" or "far right." But Dornan, an Irish-Catholic who
scored a perfect 1994 rating from the American Conservative Union
(ACU), has confounded critics by consistently winning in a majority
Democrat district without ever backing away from his core conservative
beliefs. 
<P>
This is Rep. Dornan's second on-line conference through Town Hall. The overwhelming popularity of his first conference required Town Hall to utilize the CompuServe's larger convention hall that has a capacity for over 1,000 on-line users.
<P>
Dornan represents California's 46th Congressional District -- a community that includes most of the Orange County cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. Rep. Dornan is Ranking Republican Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical and Technical Intelligence, Member of the House National Security Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Personnel.
<P>
Town Hall, Inc., based in Washington, DC, is the nation's leading interactive computer network for conservatives.  A project of The Heritage Foundation and National Review magazine, Town Hall offers conservatives both an Internet site (http://www.townhall.com) and a private forum on CompuServe to share ideas, conduct research, and plan strategy.  CompuServe users can access the Town Hall forum by typing TOWNHALL at the GO prompt.  Other personal computer users can obtain a free 30-day trial to Town Hall by calling 800-441-4142.

<h2><center> HOUSE SPENDING BILLS FALL FAR SHORT OF PROMISED  GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL, ANALYSTS SAY</h2> </center>
Contact: Jeff Dickerson or Weldon Freeman, Heritage Public Relations at (202) 675-1761 <br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>





	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15, 1995</b> -- Instead of  carrying out the voters' mandate for a radical overhaul of the federal government, the new House spending bills "merely downsize the status quo, leaving the door open to return to bloated, wasteful spending in a few short years," according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	The study focuses on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills approved by the House since May when the chamber approved a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years. While savings achieved by those bills total about $24 billion, many more billions could be saved if the House terminated obsolete programs, as suggested by Heritage earlier this year in a detailed study showing how to reduce the number of Cabinet-level departments from the current 14 to five.
<p>	Rather than terminating obsolete programs, however, the House imposed relatively equal across-the-board spending cuts that otherwise leave the programs alive and well, according to the study by Heritage's Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> and budget analyst John Barry.
<p>	"Congress is leaving in place hundreds of obsolete federal programs that ought to be shut down, but that will instead continue to waste taxpayer dollars, just at reduced spending levels," say Hodge and Barry. "This leaves the door open for government to return to the path of increasing deficits and burdensome taxes, as happened when Reagan-era spending cuts were restored by the Bush and Clinton administrations."
<p>	In May, Hodge and Barry point out, Republicans "promised to downsize the government by terminating programs that do not work, eliminating those that have become obsolete or outmoded, consolidating programs that duplicate others, ending corporate welfare, and transferring to state and local governments programs more appropriately carried out by them."
<p>	But instead, appropriations bills adopted since May show the House merely shaved relatively equal amounts from all programs in order to achieve the savings required to balance the budget on schedule, say the Heritage analysts.
<p>	The House agriculture spending bill, for example, "merely trims perennial sources of pork-barrel outlays by 4.3 percent overall," but triples funding for the office of the Agriculture Secretary, boosts by 33 percent the obsolete Rural Electrification Administration's budget, and adds 8 percent to Natural Resources Conservation Service spending.
<p>	Similarly, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation includes only "modest trims" averaging  4.5 percent, but the Maritime Administration's budget is hiked 23 percent, and programs that ought to be terminated outright like the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration are kept alive.
<p>	The Energy and Water Development appropriation imposes a "mild 5.5 percent cut on the Army Corps of Engineers, another favorite source of pork-barrel projects," say Hodge and Barry. But the measure pours more tax dollars into other needless spending projects -- like $4.2 million for maintenance of the Sam Rayburn Dam and Lake in Texas -- and puts another $3.3 billion in the Energy Supply, Research and Development program that has received more than $70 billion since 1977 with little or nothing to show for it.
<p>	If Congress is truly serious about restructuring government, Hodge and Barry say, it will use the upcoming conferences on the appropriations bills to terminate such outmoded and obsolete programs as: Job Corps ($1.2 billion); Amtrak subsidies ($628 million);  Appalachian Regional Commission ($142 million),  and Legal Services Corporation ($278 million).
<p>	Corporate welfare programs Congress should cut include: Rural Electrification Administration ($122 million); Export-Import Bank ($786.5 million); Public Broadcasting Facilities Grants ($19 million); Manufacturing Extension Partnership Programs ($81 million),  Small Business Administration ($590 million), and Federal Transit Administration ($3.9 billion).
<p>	If Congress fails to terminate such programs, Hodge and Barry say, there will be a replay of events during the Reagan administration when 94 federal programs were recommended for termination. According to a congressional study, only 12 were actually shut down, and some of them were later replaced by larger, more expensive programs.
<p>	The Small Business Administration (SBA), for instance, was slashed starting in 1981 during Reagan's first term from more than $2 billion to $557 million by 1986. But SBA rebounded during the Bush and Clinton administrations to a budget of nearly $1 billion. Merely trimming agency budgets leaves in place a federal bureaucracy that works hand-in-hand with special-interest groups to pressure Congress to restore funding to previous levels, say Hodge and Barry. This is what they believe may happen if the current House budget passes.
<p>	The Heritage budget analysts praise only two of the House-passed appropriations bills:  Education, Labor and Health and Human Resources, which eliminates 170 programs, and the Interior Department, which eliminates six agencies and 49 programs.

<h2><center>U.S.-ASIAN COMMERCE ON THE RISE  <br>
DESPITE TRADE WAR FEARS<br><br></h2></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8, 1995</b> --  America's exports to Asia totaled $153 billion and sustained 3.1 million American jobs in 1994, according to the 1995 edition of the U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook, compiled by analysts at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center (ASC). The just-released Handbook shows a 12 percent increase in exports over the previous year, and the number of Asia-related jobs grew by 500,000.<p>
	ASC analysts caution that this positive trend will be reversed unless the Clinton administration adopts a more non-threatening trans-Pacific free-trade policy. "The confrontational approach to Japan is an example of brinkmanship," says James Przystup, ASC director, "which, were it not for last-minute compromise, almost led to a full-scale trade war."<p>
	
Such a trade war would quickly spread from one Pacific rim nation to another, ASC analysts believe. The resulting bitterness and economic tension would inevitably pit America against its allies - - just at a time when U.S.-Asia multilateral cooperation on security issues is most needed. This is because many countries are concerned about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) growing military strength and the assertive way in which it challenged the Philippines' claims over the Spratly Islands. In addition, the PRC's recent long-range missile exercises near the Republic of China on Taiwan have reinforced Asia's anxiety about Chinese intentions. <p>
	The PRC's muscle-flexing is not the only challenge to existing regional security alliances. "The administration's response to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program has caused consternation among our Asian allies," says ASC Senior Policy Analyst and Handbook Editor Richard D. Fisher. "Throughout 1995," says Fisher, "the administration acted as if its managed-trade agenda held precedence over regional security." <p>
	Fisher says the U.S. policy of trade confrontation - - combined with frequent administration flip-flops on diplomatic issues - - has left Asians confused about the firmness of America's commitment to the goal of open markets. This, in turn, jeopardizes U. S. leadership on global trade, crucial to forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization. Leaders of the major Asian economic powers already are preparing for the scheduled November APEC summit at Osaka, Japan. <p>
	Most governments and businesses in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region at last agree that free-trade is the cornerstone of continued economic growth. "There is opportunity presented by this victory over Asia's long-held protectionist policies," says Fisher, "but we might lose that opportunity because of the administration's seeming abandonment of free trade."<p>
	Handbook data demonstrate how Asia's initial round of market-opening reforms are benefiting  American businesses. A country-by-country analysis reveals that sales of "Made In USA" goods and services are growing in the region's increasingly affluent countries: Malaysia's imports reached $7 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the 1993 level. The level of South Korea's imports from the United States was $18 billion, a 22 percent increase. Singapore's $13 billion represented an 11 percent increase. American exports to Thailand reached $4.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent over 1993.<p>
	Handbook statistics show several states are reaping substantial economic benefits from this explosion of commerce. More than 828,000 California jobs are dependent on Asia-bound exports - -  which rose by 20 percent in 1994 and reached $41.4 billion. In Texas, 247,000 jobs were sustained as exports rose 19 percent above 1993 levels, reaching $12.4 billion. Illinois' $6.6 billion worth of exports - - supporting 131,000 statewide jobs - - represents a 23 percent increase.<p>
	Pacific-bound commerce accounts for a significant share of jobs and income in other states. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oregon, and New York all witnessed at least 10 percent growth in the value of their Asian exports. Furthermore, the Handbook shows many smaller states are also gaining from this boom. For example, Maryland's $3 billion worth of exports reaching Asian consumers represented a 40 percent increase over the level in 1993, and supported 28,000 jobs.<p>
	Key social, political, military, and economic statistics on all Asia-Pacific nations are included in the Handbook. This year's edition also contains data on 19 Asia-Pacific countries adapted from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.<p>
	According to Przystup, "the data show that free-trade is a driving force for the economic growth that leads to democratization and security. America dares not lose historic diplomatic and economic opportunities through lack of a coherent policy towards Asia."<p>

<h2><center>BENEFITS "CAP" DECREASES<br>
OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br>
<h3>Abortions Didn't Increase <br>
Under New Jersey Program<br><br></h3></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 7, 1995 </b>-- New Jersey's "family cap" policy -- which denies increases in cash welfare benefits to single mothers who have additional children while already receiving welfare -- has resulted in a significant decline in out-of-wedlock births with no corresponding increase in abortions.<p>
	According to Heritage Foundation welfare analyst Robert Rector, the evidence from New Jersey indicates that in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, there was an average decrease in out-of-wedlock births of 10 percent. This, even though the average decrease in benefits came to just 4 percent of the monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits received by the typical welfare mother. There was no statistically significant corresponding increase in abortions, according to Rector, who obtained his information from New Jersey's Department of Human Services in Trenton.<p>
	"The New Jersey data show why Congress should consider imposing a similar cap on benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children as part of an overall welfare-reform strategy for reducing illegitimacy," says Rector, Heritage's senior analyst for welfare and family issues.<p>
	The family cap went into effect in October of 1992, and gave affected mothers -- those already enrolled in AFDC -- a 10-month grace period, meaning the limit on benefits applied only those who bore children after July 1993.    <p>     
	"In the year before the cap, the average monthly number of births was 1,331; in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, average monthly births among AFDC mothers fell to 1,197. The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 births per month, or 10 percent," Rector concludes.<p>	
	"Critics claim that the family cap has not caused an actual decrease in the number of illegitimate births, but merely a delay in welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office," Rector says. "But mothers on AFDC in New Jersey still have a huge economic incentive -- in the form of an increase in food stamp and Medicaid benefits for each additional child born -- to notify the welfare department of a childbirth." Moreover, Rector says the official data from New Jersey are adjusted to include births reported late, and still show a decline in illegitimacy.<p>
	Rector says previously reported data leaked to the press by scholars at Rutgers University -- data that supposedly showed no decrease in out-of-wedlock births as a result of New Jersey's policy -- were not conclusive. Rector points out that the Rutgers scholars have yet to finish their evaluation, have yet to issue an official report, and that their study did not, in fact, show zero effect on out-of-wedlock births. "In fact, the Rutgers analysis shows a lower rate of out-of-wedlock births after the cap went into effect," says Rector.<p>

<center><h2>HOUSE FARM BILL A "GOOD FIRST STEP"<br>
 BUT MORE NEEDED, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br></center><br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<h4>Study Projects $135 Billion Economic
Boost From  Phasing Out Farm Programs</h4><br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>	<br><br>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 6, 1995 </b>-- House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Pat Roberts' farm reform bill is "a good first step" but the Kansas Republican's proposal needs major changes to achieve real benefits for American farmers and consumers, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
	In a paper released today, John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agricultural Policy Project, says the bill -- which is scheduled for markup by the House Agriculture Committee September 13-15 -- needs a definite date when current farm programs and payments will end. The termination date should be in five years, Frydenlund says, not the seven suggested by the Roberts bill.<p>
	Nevertheless, he says, the Roberts bill, if implemented, would "significantly enhance the opportunity for farmers to meet the growing demands of the world marketplace." By extricating America's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, the bill would "allow farmers to produce to meet domestic consumer demand rather than to satisfy the dictates of the federal government," says Frydenlund.<p>
	Roberts' "Freedom to Farm Act" eliminates supply-control programs such as the Acreage Reduction Program, ends the Farmer-Owned Reserve for excess crop production, and replaces current target and deficiency payments with a new seven-year system of declining transitional payments, Frydenlund says.<p>
	But he believes the bill can work only if it locks in a deadline for phasing out these programs. "While Roberts' bill locks in fixed declining payments to farmers for the next seven years, there is no guarantee that these payments will cease at the end of the seven years," Frydenlund says. "The result could be buying a few years of time under the guise of real reform, only to slip back to the status quo when reducing the federal budget is no longer a top priority in Congress. In future years, supporters of centrally planned agriculture could point to any slight downturn in prices or land values as justification for a return to the current system of government controls," he says.<p>
	 The Roberts bill also should be changed to cap the transition payments for particular crops to prevent their "becoming an exorbitant windfall" if prices soar before the end of the phaseout period, and to "eliminate or at least drastically reduce" the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps up to 36 million acres of otherwise productive land idled, Frydenlund says.<p>
	Finally, Frydenlund believes Congress should impose a spending cap on the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and limit its borrowing authority. Under the current CCC,  there is little to constrain the Secretary of Agriculture's ability to "spend whatever is necessary regardless of what has been provided by Congress in budget authority" on deficiency payments to wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers.<p>
	"Not only does open-ended borrowing authority mean there is no real limit to potential farm program spending at present, but this nearly unlimited source of funds also allows the Secretary to raid CCC to cover mismanagement of other farm programs," Frydenlund says.<p>
	In a related Heritage study to be released later this week, Frydenlund and Heritage Senior Fellow for Statistical Policy Analysis David Winston conclude that the nation's economy would expand by nearly $135 billion within a decade as a result of ending the current farm program.<p>
	The study measures the "multiplier effect" on the economy that would result as farmers increase production, earn higher incomes through expanded exports, and generate new economic activity in farm-related industries such as equipment manufacturing, fertilizer, seed, livestock feed, food processing, transportation and shipping.<p>
	"In a 10-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state contributing to the expanded economy. Every single state will win under this plan," Frydenlund and Winston say.<p>
	Their conclusion was based on data generated by an econometric computer model developed by Heritage for the think tank's report, "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." That plan -- which proposed phasing out all federal farm programs by the year 2001 -- was made public earlier this year.<p>
	"In fact, the nation's economy would expand by $10.9 billion just in the first year, and this is a conservative estimate," according to Frydenlund and Winston.<p>

Unfortunately, the budget issue is beginning to lose the attention of the voters.  In the end, success at the polls will not be determined by the poignancy of the issues, but by the amount of interest the issue can muster among voters.  And so, light weight stupid issues like school prayer and smut on the internet become the cause d'jour while important matters like the solvency of our economy are neglected.<br><b>Mark, Staten Island, NY</b><P>

Just shut it down.<br>
It's time to call Clinton's and Paneta's bluff.
Keep up the talk of the "irresponsibility of leaving more debt to our children"on top of the $5 trillion already spent.
<br>Enough is enough!<br><b>Dean, Portland, OR</b><p>

Republicans should stand fast.  Don't get political
cold feet.  You don't need to compromise.
Compromising your principles means violating them!!
That's not what we sent you there to do.
<BR>
Unfortunately, old-bulls like Bob Dole seem to have a
"principle of the day" - whatever seems to be popular.
These are not principles, so we would have to call
wavering Republicans such as Bob Dole unprincipled.
<BR>
I speak for myself and hundreds of others who are tired
of seeing the old-timers run scared from the media, and
the freshman ignored by the Republican leadership.
<BR>
Get your act together guys, or we'll put you out to
pasture as soon as possible!!!
<br><b>Ron, St. Louis, MO</b>
<P>
The Democrats obviously have no desire to balance the budget. They are only playing along because they want to appear to be part of the process. If the Republicans had not gained a majority there would no talk of balanced budget, or welfare reform or Medicare reform from the Democrats. The Republicans should ignore the polls for the next year and keep pushing their budget reform. If the Republicans faulter at this there is a danger of the Democrats retaking the Congress.<br><b>Mark, Pasadena, CA</b><P>

Ronald Reagan once told his budget director, Jim Miller, "Jim, let's just shut it down, and see whether anyone notices!"<br><b>Terry, Toms River, NJ</b><P>

Please DO NOT raise the national DEBT ceiling 1 dollar on our children and grandchildren. I believe AS HAS ALREADY panned out in the media that the Republicians can make NO deals with either the Democrats or the President. Therefore I suggest a strong hand approach in dealing with him, DON'T BUDGE ONE INCH, give him the bills then adjurn congress and go home and let him squell. A week or two of no budget wont cause America to go under,and Him, Morris and his other handlers and so called experts can just scream. Get tuff with the media, show them that Clinton and Dems wont compromise, do your own media blitz. He has already stated he does not like this or that in the bills, face it at every turn he will make Congress look bad, SO PLAY HARDBALL with him. If he calls you back from adjournment TAKE YOUR TIME getting back, let Clinton be the GRINCH THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS. I have learned that NASTY people can only be delt with from a STRONG position and NEVER, NEVER compromise unless THEY are willing to also compromise.<br><b>William, Frederick, MD</b><P>

Quit the cutbacks and start cutting whole departments!
Any bureaucracy not eliminated while we have the chance
will just "grow" itself back within a decade or three.<br><b>Mike, Little Rock, AR</b><P>

 I'm very anxious about the 4.8 trillion dollar dept; particulary when I contemplate the future for my children. As a middle class income earner, I find the tax burden excessive, and quite frankly I'm getting physically and mentally tired. I want the federal government to be downsized, the states to be empowered, and my taxes restributed with more staying in my state.<br><b>Robert, Sierra Vista, AZ</b><P>

Republicans have lost some credibility with me by failing to address some of the more egregious examples of the so-called corporate welfare and special interest subsidies.  But the party has to remain firm in its convictions and continue to stress the benefits of the budget package without feeling that they must respond to the criticisms of the left.
<br>Stay the high ground.<br><b>James, Centerville, OH</b><p>

The Republicans in Congress must stand fast!  They must
withstand the barrage of the criticism of desperate
liberals.  Let Clinton save face by "negotiating" with him 
and making minor conciliations that he can then gloat
over.  As long as the result is a balanced budget, the
citizens of this country are the real winners.<br><b>Louise, Menlo Park, CA</b><P>

<h2>STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS</h2>
                          OF THE PRESIDENT
<P>
<B>Courtesy of:  THE WHITE HOUSE</B><br>

                    Office of the Press Secretary<P>

      January 23, 1996
<P>	     
	     </CENTER>
	     
	     
9:14 P.M. EST<P>
	     
<blockquote>	     
	     <B>THE PRESIDENT:</B>  Thank you very much.  <P>
	     
	     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th 
Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our 
land:  Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform 
around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in 
Bosnia and to their families, I thank you.  America is very, very 
proud of you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union 
-- not the state of our government, but of our American community; 
and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, 
to form a more perfect union.  <P>
	     
	     The state of the Union is strong.  (Applause.)  Our 
economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades.  We have the 
lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.  We 
have completed -- created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million 
of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles.  
America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 
1970s.  And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of 
new businesses started in our country.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing 
hope for new peace.  And perhaps most important, we are gaining 
ground in restoring our fundamental values.  The crime rate, the 
welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy 
rate are all down.  And as they go down, prospects for America's 
future go up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     We live in an age of possibility.  A hundred years ago 
we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move to an age of technology, 
information, and global competition.  These changes have opened vast 
new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them 
with stiff challenges.  While more Americans are living better, too 
many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and 
they are rightly concerned about the security of their families.<P>

	     We must answer here three fundamental questions:  First,  
how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality 
for all Americans who are willing to work for it?  Second, how do we 
preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future?  
And, third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?  <P>
	     
	     We know big government does not have all the answers.  
We know there's not a program for every problem.  (Applause.)  We 
know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less 
bureaucratic government in Washington.  And we have to give the 
American people one that lives within its means.  (Applause.)  The 
era of big government is over.  (Applause.)  But we cannot go back to 
the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.  
(Applause.)  	  <P>

	     Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation 
working together to meet the challenges we face together.  
Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have 
both.  (Applause.)  I believe our new, smaller government must work 
in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens 
through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, 
charitable and civic associations.  Our goal must be to enable all 
our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger 
families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer 
streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.  <P>
	     
	     To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of 
ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our 
challenges together.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with 
balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans.  
(Applause.)  There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent 
deficit spending must come to an end.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I compliment the Republican leadership and the 
membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this 
task of balancing the budget.  (Applause.)  And I thank the Democrats 
for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, 
which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of 
deficit reduction.  Lower interest rates have made it easier for 
businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs.  Lower 
interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car 
payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens.  Now, it is time 
to finish the job and balance the budget.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Though differences remain among us which are 
significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are 
common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your 
Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and 
to provide a modest tax cut.  <P>
	     
	     These cuts are real.  They will require sacrifice from 
everyone.  But these cuts do not undermine are fundamental 
obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by 
endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or education, or the environment, 
or by raising taxes on working families.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I have said before, and let me say again, many good 
ideas have come out of our negotiations.  I have learned a lot about 
the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us.  I 
have learned a lot about the good ideas have that we could all 
embrace.  
	     <P>
	     We ought to resolve our remaining differences.  I am 
willing to work to resolve them.  I am ready to meet tomorrow.  But I 
ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that 
both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced 
budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future.  We 
should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of 
today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday.  The challenges 
are significant.  But our nation was built on challenges.  America 
was built on challenges, not promises.  And when we work together to 
meet them, we never fail.  That is the key to a more perfect Union.  
Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we 
all face as a people.  Our first challenge is to cherish our children 
and strengthen America's families.  Family is the foundation of 
American life.  If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger 
America.  <P>
	     
	     Before I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank 
my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than 
anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and 
children -- a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First 
Lady.  Thank you, Hillary.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     All strong families begin with taking more 
responsibility for our children.  I've heard Mrs. Gore say that it's 
hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child.  So 
all of us, not just as parents, but all of us in our other roles -- 
our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches 
and synagogues, our businesses, our governments -- all of us have a 
responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most 
of their lives and their God-given capacities.<P>
	     
	     To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and 
television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to 
enjoy.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V chip 
in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are 
inappropriate for their children.  (Applause.)  When parents control 
what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is 
enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their 
children's upbringing.  And I urge them to do it.  The V chip 
requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now 
pending in this Congress.  It has bipartisan support, and I urge you 
to pass it now.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     To make the V chip work, I challenge the broadcast 
industry to do what movies have done -- to identify your program in 
ways that help parents to protect their children.  And I invite the 
leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to 
come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way 
on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television.  I 
am ready to work with you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I say to those who make and market cigarettes, every 
year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the 
law.  Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened 
as a result.  Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive 
marketing campaigns that appeal to our children.  We are simply 
saying:  Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the 
line on children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to 
those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time:  For too long 
our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, 
instead of supporting them.  The Congress and I are near agreement on 
sweeping welfare reform.  We agree on time limits, tough work 
requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement.  
But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are 
required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is 
happening to their children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan 
welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work 
and do the right thing by our children.  I will sign it immediately.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Let us be candid about this difficult problem.  Passing 
a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step.  The next 
step is to make it work.  I challenge people on welfare to make the 
most of this opportunity for independence.  I challenge American 
businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work 
force.  I applaud the work of religious groups and other who care for 
the poor.  More than anyone else in our society, they know the true 
difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help.<P>

	     Everyone of us should join them.  That is the only way 
we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the 
American people.  <P>
	     
	     To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to 
keep the teen pregnancy rate going down.  I am gratified, as I'm sure 
all Americans are, that it has dropped for two years in a row.  But 
we all know it is still far too high.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of 
prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an 
organization that will support grass-roots community efforts all 
across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.  
And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts. <P>
	     
	     I call on American men and women in families to give 
greater respect to one another.  We must end the deadly scourge of 
domestic violence in our country.  (Applause.)  And I challenge 
America's families to work harder to stay together.  For families who 
stay together not only do better economically, their children do 
better as well.     <P>
	     
	     In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country 
to love and care for their children.  If your family has separated, 
you must pay your child support.  We're doing more than ever to make 
sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit 
something about that, too:  A check will substitute for a parent's 
love and guidance.  And only you -- only you can make the decision to 
help raise your children.  No matter who you are, how low or high 
your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every 
American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the 
educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century.  In 
our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the 
information superhighway, with computers and good software, and 
well-trained teachers.  We are working with the telecommunications 
industry, educators and parents to connect 20 percent of California's 
classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in 
the entire United States by the year 2000.  (Applause.)  I ask 
Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we 
can make sure this national partnership succeeds.<P>
	     
	     Every diploma ought to mean something.  I challenge 
every community, every school and every state to adopt national 
standards of excellence; to measure whether schools are meeting those 
standards; to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers 
have more flexibility for grass-roots reform; and to hold them 
accountable for results.  That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is 
all about.<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to give all parents the right to 
choose which public school their children will attend; and to let 
teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they 
do a good job.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge all our schools to teach character 
education, to teach good values and good citizenship.  And if it 
means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer 
jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their 
students to wear school uniforms.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge our parents to become their children's first 
teachers.  Turn off the TV.  See that the homework is done.  And 
visit your children's classroom.  No program, no teacher, no one else 
can do that for you.<P>

	     My fellow Americans, higher education is more important 
today than ever before.  We've created a new student loan program 
that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have 
dramatically cut the student loan default rate.  That's something we 
should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few 
years ago.<P>

	     Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this 
year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their 
local communities to improve the lives of their friends and 
neighbors.  (Applause.)<P>

	     These initiatives are right for America and we should 
keep them going.  And we should also work hard to open the doors of 
college even wider.  I challenge Congress to expand work-study and 
help one million young Americans work their way through college by 
the year 2000; to provide a $1000 merit scholarship for the top five 
percent of graduates in every high school in the United States; -- 
(applause) -- to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and 
needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition 
tax deductible.  It's a good idea for America.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our third challenge is to help every American who is 
willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age.  
People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new 
economy.  They need education and training for a lifetime.  They need 
more support for families raising children.  They need retirement 
security.  They need access to health care.  More and more Americans 
are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last 
a lifetime.  <P>
	     
	     So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, 
antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 
for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for 
community college tuition or other training.  This is a G.I. Bill for 
America's workers we should all be able to agree on.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More and more Americans are working hard without a 
raise.  Congress sets the minimum wage.  Within a year, the minimum 
wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power.  Four dollars 
and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of 
Americans and their children are trying to live on it.  I challenge 
you to raise their minimum wage.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million 
hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work 
full-time would have to raise their children in poverty, and to 
encourage people to move from welfare to work.  This expanded earned 
income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of 
four living on $20,000.  The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed 
this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these 
people.  We should not do that.  We should not do that.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I also agree that the people who are helped under this 
initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to 
do a good job raising their children and at work.  I agree that we 
need a tax credit for working families with children.  That's one of 
the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on.  I know 
it is strongly supported by the Republican majority.  And it should 
be part of any final budget agreement.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I want to challenge every business that can possibly 
afford it to provide pensions for your employees.  And I challenge 
Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference 
on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and 
farmers to establish their own pension plans.  That is something we 
should all agree on.  (Applause.)  <P>

	     We should also protect existing pension plans.  Two 
years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both 
sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million 
working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more.  
Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers's 
pension funds.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of 
employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would 
raise money for the treasury.  But I believe it is false economy.  I 
vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in 
the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies 
that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their 
family gets sick.  Over the past two years, over one million 
Americans in working families have lost their health insurance.  We 
have to do more to make health care available to every American.  And 
Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance 
companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop 
denying coverage for preexisting conditions.  Let's all do that.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must 
have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of 
Medicare and Medicaid -- not just to the poor, but to people in 
working families, including children, people with disabilities, 
people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes.  <P>
	     
	     In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by 
fighting health care fraud and abuse.  We have all agreed to save 
much more.  We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund.  
But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who 
need Medicare and Medicaid.  America cannot become stronger if they
become weaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and 
child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health 
care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid -- these things, along 
with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 -- these things 
will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the 
most of their own lives.  <P>
	     
	     But employers and employees must do their part, as well, 
as they are doing in so many of our finest companies -- working 
together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term 
gain.  As workers increase their hours and their productivity, 
employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share 
the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad 
ones.  When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and 
so does America.<P>
	     
	     Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back 
from crime and gangs and drugs.  At last we have begun to find a way 
to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police 
forces to catch criminals and prevent crime.  This strategy, called 
community policing, is clearly working.  Violent crime is coming down 
all across America.  In New York City murders are down 25 percent; in 
St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32 percent.		      But we 
still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our 
people are free from fear. <P>
	     
	     The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of 
community policing.  It provides funds for 100,000 new police in 
communities of all sizes.  We're already a third of the way there.  
And I challenge the Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with a 
strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.  
(Applause.)
	     <P>
	     Community policing also requires bonds of trust between 
citizens and police.  I ask all Americans to respect and support our 
law enforcement officers.  And to our police, I say, our children 
need you as role models and heroes.  Don't let them down.<P>
	     
	     The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with 
criminal records from buying guns.  The assault weapons ban is 
keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent 
gangs.  I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on 
gangs the way we once took on the mob.  I'm directing the FBI and 
other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles 
and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults 
teenagers who maim and kill like adults.  <P>
	     
	     And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant 
associations:  Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying 
the lives of decent tenants.  From now on, the rule for residents who 
commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to match federal policy to 
assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of 
their sentence.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More police and punishment are important, but they're 
not enough.  We have got to keep more of our young people out of 
trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but 
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of 
our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to.  And I 
challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these 
grass-roots prevention efforts.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce 
the drug problem.  The challenge begins in our homes, with parents 
talking to their children openly and firmly.  It embraces our 
churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.  <P>
	     
	     I challenge Congress not to cut our support for 
drug-free schools.  People like the DARE officers are making a real 
impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength 
to say no when the time comes.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of 
drugs into America.  For the last two years, one man in particular 
has been on the front lines of that effort.  Tonight I am nominating 
him -- a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of 
the United States Military Southern Command -- General Barry 
McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two 
Silver Stars fighting for this country.  Tonight I ask that he lead 
our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad.  To succeed, he 
needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before.  He needs 
all of us.  Every one of us has a role to play on this team.  <P>
	     
	     Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your 
country one more time.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our fifth challenge:  to leave our environment safe and 
clean for the next generation.  Because of a generation of bipartisan 
effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's 
blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut 
in half.  Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource.  But 
10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic 
waste dump.  A third of us breathe air that endangers our health.  
And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink.  We still 
have much to do.  
	     <P>
	     Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement 
by 25 percent.  That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more 
smog in our air, more pesticides in our food.  Lobbyists for 
polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills 
to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children.  
Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and 
let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook.  I challenge 
Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     This issue has not been a partisan issue.  The most 
significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under 
a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon.  We can work 
together.  We have to believe some basic things.  Do you believe we 
can expand the economy without hurting the environment?  I do.  Do 
you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the 
environment up?  I know we can.  That should be our commitment.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     We must challenge businesses and communities to take 
more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it 
easier for them to do it.  To businesses this administration is 
saying:  If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than 
government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do 
it -- as long as you do it right.  To communities we say:  We must 
strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to 
disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work 
with business to cut pollution.  People do have a right to know that 
their air and their water are safe.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership 
in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world.  Because of 
American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at 
peace.  And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security. <P>

	     We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War 
II.  (Applause.)  I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all 
others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others 
on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our 
conflicts since:  I salute your service and so do the American 
people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     All over the world, even after the Cold War, people 
still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of 
peace and freedom.  But as the Cold War fades into memory, voices of 
isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities.  I 
say they are wrong.<P>
	     
	     The threats we face today as Americans respect no 
nation's borders.  Think of them:  terrorism, the spread of weapons 
of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and 
religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental 
degradation.  If we fail to address these threats today, we will 
suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Of course, we can't be everywhere.  Of course, we can't 
do everything.  But where our interests and our values are at stake, 
and where we can make a difference, America must lead.  We must not 
be isolationist.  We must not be the world's policeman.  But we can 
and should be the world's very best peacemaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where 
we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the 
risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for 
people here and around the world.  For the first time since the dawn 
of the nuclear age -- for the first time since the dawn of the 
nuclear age -- there is not a single Russian missile pointed at 
America's children.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons 
program.  In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, 
the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided.  Through 
tougher trade deals for America -- over 80 of them -- we have opened 
markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing 
faster than imports and creating good American jobs.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     We stood with those taking risks for peace:  In Northern 
Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their 
parents, violence must never return.  In the Middle East, where Arabs 
and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share 
knowledge and resources, and even dreams.  <P>
	     
	     And we stood up for peace in Bosnia.  Remember the 
skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and 
torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading 
war.  All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way 
to the promise of peace.  Now, our troops and a strong NATO, together 
with our new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, are helping 
that peace to take hold.  <P>
	     
	     As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan 
congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops 
were doing, but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing.  
They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were 
proud to be carrying it out.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of 
the American people.  But make no mistake about it:  important 
challenges remain.  <P>
	     
	     The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear 
stockpiles by another 25 percent.  I urge the Senate to ratify it 
now.  (Applause.)  We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons 
by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we 
can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical 
Weapons Convention this year.  (Applause.)  We can intensify the 
fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad 
if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after 
the Oklahoma City bombing now.  (Applause.)  We can help more people 
move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if 
Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just 
discussed are for all of us.  Our seventh challenge is really 
America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight:  to 
reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them.  <P>
	     
	     Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it 
applies to everyone else.  (Applause.)  This Congress banned gifts 
and meals from lobbyists.  This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose 
who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill.  
This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb 
special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly 
bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation.  (Applause.)  You, 
Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we 
can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you 
promised the American people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our administration is working hard to give the American 
people a government that works better and costs less.  Thanks to the 
work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of 
unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decision-making out 
of Washington, back to states and local communities.<P>

	     As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller 
government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the 
most of their own lives.  We are helping America's communities, not 
with more bureaucracy, but with more opportunities.  Through our 
successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're 
helping people to find jobs, to start businesses.  And with tax 
incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, 
we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need 
them.<P>

	     But there are some areas that the federal government 
should not leave and should address and address strongly.  One of 
these areas is the problem of illegal immigration.  After years of 
neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the 
protection of our borders.  We are increasing border controls by 50 
percent.  We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of 
illegal immigrants.  And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive 
order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal 
immigrants.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Let me be very clear about this:  We are still a nation 
of immigrants; we should be proud of it.  We should honor every legal 
immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to 
become a new citizen.  But we are also a nation of laws.<P>

	     I want to say a special word now to those who work for 
our federal government.  Today our federal is 200,000 employees 
smaller than it was the day I took office as President.  (Applause.)
Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, 
and it's getting smaller every day.  Most of our fellow Americans 
probably don't know that.  And there's a good reason -- a good 
reason:  The remaining federal work force is composed of hard-working 
Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever 
before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I'd like to give you one example.  His name is Richard 
Dean.  He's a 49 year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social 
Security Administration for 22 years now.  Last year he was hard at 
work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 
169 people and brought the rubble down all around him.  He reentered 
that building four times.  He saved the lives of three women.  He's 
here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and 
applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal 
heroism.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there.  This last 
November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut 
down.  And the second time the government shut down he continued 
helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. <P>
	     
	     On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the 
other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for 
the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber:  Never, 
ever shut the federal government down again.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need 
their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also 
challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the 
United States -- to honor the obligations of this great nation as we 
have for 220 years; to rise above partisanship and pass a 
straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America 
keeps its word.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, 
and even more from America.  But I am confident:  When Americans work 
together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their 
synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any 
challenge.  <P>
	     
	     I say again, the era of big government is over.  But we 
can't go back to the era of fending for yourself.  We have to go 
forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as 
one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide 
us -- the division, the discrimination, the rancor -- we have to 
reach across it to find common ground.  We have got to work together 
if we want America to work.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just 
that.  Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public 
school system.  A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help 
inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can 
believe in.  Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in 
Oklahoma City.  Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow 
citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy.  She 
reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of 
Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and 
community.  <P>

	     Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special 
Americans.  And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are 
the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to 
carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the 
centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer -- not 
because they are star athletes, but because they are star citizens, 
community heroes meeting America's challenges.  They are our real 
champions.  <P>
	     
	     Please stand up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship 
in our own lives.  None of us can finish the race alone.  We can only 
achieve our destiny together -- one hand, one generation, one 
American connecting to another.<P>
	     
	     There have always been things we could to together, 
dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own.  
We Americans have forged our identity, our very union, from the very 
point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, 
every different opinion.  But we must be bound together by a faith 
more powerful than any doctrine that divides us -- by our believe in 
progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common 
ground.  <P>
	     
	     America has always sought and always risen to every 
challenge.  Who would say that having come so far together, we will 
not go forward from here?  Who would say that this age of possibility 
is not for all Americans?  <P>
	     
	     Our country is and always has been a great and good 
nation.  But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts. <P>
	     
	     Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States 
of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<P>

<H2>Transcript of Bob Dole's response to the President's address</H2>

<P>January 23, 1996<BR></center>

<P>From the Associated Press
<blockquote>
<P>Text of the Republican response by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to President Clinton's State of the Union address. 

<P>Good evening. I'm Bob Dole, and I'm here to briefly reply to the president's message on the state of the union. But a reply need not be an argument. Instead, I want to present another view. Another way of thinking about the problems we face. 

<P>A few years back I met with a group of 100 high school seniors -- one young man and a woman from every state. During the meeting one young man stood up and said "Senator, everybody has somebody who speaks for them. But who speaks for us?" he asked me. "Who speaks for the future?" 

<P>That's what I want to talk with you about tonight -- the future and the values that will shape it. Those values are at the heart of our disagreements with the president. President Clinton says our differences are few, the budget numbers are close and that we should try to find common ground. We have tried and tried, again and again. But such a place appears to be elusive. 

<P>For while we share an abiding love of country, we have been unable to agree. Why? Because we have starkly different philosophies of government and profoundly different visions of America. So all the talk and fighting in Washington can seem very remote. And we political figures can seem detached and petty and far removed from the every day struggle of American citizens and families. 
<P>But the truth is we can not ignore the future. The point of our lives, after all, is to raise children who are smarter and healthier and nobler than we are; to contribute to a country that is better than today's America; to make a world that is better and finer for all of God's creation. 

<P>America's greatness -- all that we take such justified pride in today -- America's greatness was built by men and women who sacrificed ease and comfort and the joys of today, to build a better future for those who came after. How many pioneers faced a hostile and threatening frontier? How many immigrants gave their bodies to the mines? And how many soldiers lost their lives on the distant battlefields to secure a better future for their children and their children's children? 

<P>In every generation, Americans have made these sacrifices, and found in their making a purpose and a direction to life. Now we have to do that in this generation. And thanks to God and fortune and those who went before, we don't have to conquer a dangerous frontier. We don't have to fight another great war. What we do have to do is face the fact that we cannot give in to all of our own desires. As we have just heard, President Clinton and those who share his vision of America have chosen their ground. 

<P>The president chose to defend, with his veto, a welfare system that no one can defend -- for it is a daily assault on the values of self-reliance and family. He has chosen to defend an education establishment run by liberals whose goal is to operate every school in America by remote control from Washington. He has chosen to veto a defense bill because it provided for defending America against weapons of mass destruction. 

<P>He has chosen to defend the status quo in Medicare -- a system on which lives depend and a program in urgent need of rescue. President Clinton has chosen to defend and increase a tax burden that has pushed countless families into their own personal recessions. And unfortunately, he has chosen to veto the first balanced budget in a generation, offering only a fantasy in its place. 

<P>Now if you have a child asleep in your home tonight, you will probably check on him or her before you go to bed. As you bend over to tuck your child in, think about this: If we continue down this path we will place a tremendous burden of debt on every child in America. How can we betray them and their parents and grandparents? How can we fail to act? We cannot, and we will not. 

<P>Every political movement, and every public official must locate a place in his heart where compromise ends -- a core of conviction where we keep our conscience. There comes a time when even practical leaders must refuse to bend or to yield. For Republicans and countless Democrats and independents, we have arrived at that time. 

<P>America's troubles are real, but our choices are clear and our will is strong. We must rein in our runaway government, return power to the people, reduce the tax burden. Put parents back in charge of our schools. Untie the hands of our police. Restore justice to our courts and put our faith once again in the basic goodness, wisdom and self-reliance of our people. 

<P>Well, the president spoke with great eloquence about a future with unlimited possibilities. It is a vision we all share, for it is the story of America. 

<P>But while the president's words speak of change, his deeds are a contradiction. The president claims to embrace the future while clinging to the policies of the past. 

<P>For three years this administration has valued dependence on government over self-reliance. Federal power over community, federal planning over individual enterprise. It has tried to place government experts in charge of our economy and our health and our lives. 

<P>It has put liberal judges on the bench to war with our values and it questions the participation of religious people in public life, treating them as fanatics out of step with America. 

<P>President Clinton shares a view of America held by our country's elites. 

<P>A nation of special interest groups united only by a dependence on government, competing with each other for handouts and held back by outdated values. For those who hold this view, there is only one answer for our problems: 

<P>More government. 

<P>Bigger government. 

<P>More meddlesome government. 

<P>If you listened closely tonight, that's what President Clinton talked about. President Clinton may well be the rear guard of the welfare state. He is the chief obstacle to a balanced budget and the balanced budget amendment. He is almost the last public defender of a discredited status quo. We Republicans will not give up the struggle because America will round the corner to a brighter future if we prevail. 

<P>I come from Russell, Kansas -- there's not much money there, but the people are rich in many other ways. Life isn't always easy, but the values are durable -- love of God and country and family, commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility, and self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. 

<P>Those values made America the greatest nation on earth, and there is no doubt in my mind that we can get our country back on track if we reassert them again as a people, and if our government returns to them as a matter of national policy. 

<P>Now just like the debate over the budget this wither, our arguments this spring will seem a maze of conflicting numbers, assertions and high-sounding words. But what we're really arguing about are the values that will shape our nation, our government, and the future of that child sleeping down the hall. 

<P>Now some people try to make these matters complicated, but they're simple in my home town -- and probably where you are, as well. Americans know that handouts without responsibility destroy human dignity. 

<P>We know that the help of a neighbor is preferable to that of a bureaucrat. And we know that wealth is created by free individuals with their smarts and their sweat. Government programs can only spend it. 

<P>I'm a very practical man, but I believe in the miracle of America and I've never gone in for dramatics, but I do believe we have reached a defining moment. It is as if we went to sleep in one America and woke up in another. 

<P>It is as though our government and our institutions and our culture have been attacked by liberals and are careening dangerously off course. But we know the way back, but we must act now and my promise tonight is that we can, and we will. 

<P>If there is no agreement, we will send President Clinton another balanced budget with tax relief for American families, regulatory relief for small businesses, farmers and ranchers and real welfare reform. 

<P>We will always be mindful of the poor and disadvantaged, education and the environment. But we will begin the defunding of Big Brother by unfunding wasteful programs and meddlesome departments. We will send the president bill after bill, returning power and programs to the states and to the people. 

<P>We will challenge President Clinton again and again to walk the talk he talks so well. As we do, remember this: Our battles will not be about numbers. They'll be about the character of our nation. Yes, our country has problems. But we can handle them. 

<P>Whether it's deficit spending or the welfare bureaucracy or our liberal courts or the trouble in our schools, what's wrong is that the elites in charge don't believe in what the people believe in. That we can fix. We know what made America great. All we need now is the resolve to lead our country back to her place in the sun and the courage to speak for the future. 

<P>So when you close the door to your child's room tonight, remember, it's not too late. This is a great country. Our strength has always come from the truth, and from sacrifice and honor, and from the bottomless reservoir of hope and work and courage that is the American people. Always, we have built for the future with a half-silent consciousness that we were doing the work of the Lord. 

<P>Today, we feel ourselves beset by many difficulties: by violence and resentment, by racial and partisan divisions, by economic storms, by dizzying changes of every kind. 

<P>Yet, the blood of greatness, of noble forebears, of men and women of incredible achievement still runs through us all. That birthright is what it means to bear the name "American." 

<P>In this time, in this generation, in this year, we -- like they -- can and will overcome. We need only to rededicate ourselves to earning the name we have inherited. 

<P>Thank you very much. God bless America and good night.

<h2>Statement by<br>
 National Republican Congressional Committee Chariman<br>
 Bill Paxon</h2>

<blockquote>
National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill Paxon (R-
NY) made the following statement tonight regarding Bill Clinton's State 
of the Union address.
<P>
"Tonight Bill Clinton proved one thing beyond the shadow of a doubt -- 
he's a congenital liberal who believes that a bigger, more intrusive 
government is the answer to what ails the nation.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth.  
<P>
''Bill Clinton gave a speech that was designed to make people feel good -- 
that's what he does best: make promises to make people like him, then 
break the faith with the American people. 
<P>
"The Republican-controlled 104th Congress is different. We have 
advanced an agenda that is in line with the values and priorities of the 
American people -- balancing the out-of-control federal budget, saving, 
and strengthening Medicare, providing real reform to a failed welfare 
system and giving over-taxed working families much needed tax relief.
<P>
"Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats should face the facts: 
Republicans are fighting for Americans, young and old.  Democrats are 
fighting for nothing more than re-election.
<P>
"In 1992, Clinton and the Congressional Democrats campaigned for 
change.  In 1994, the voters saw the truth -- Democrats were fighting for 
the failed status quo and they elected a Republican majority to Congress.  
Today, Leon Panetta said this debate is about competing visions for the 
future of America. Republicans want a government that performs better, 
spends less and is less intrusive in the daily lives of every-day Americans.  
Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress want a bigger government 
that spends more, taxes more all to fund the failed policies of the status 
quo in Washington.
<P>
"In 1994, the voters said Republicans had a better idea. In 1996, they will 
vote to increase our majority to work with a Republican president so that 
we are able to continue the changes we began in January 1995."
<P>
Many American parents were offended by the "challenge" from the 
President to cherish their children.  Parents don't need the President to tell 
them to love their children and be their "firth teachers."
<P>
The first step toward meeting America's challenges is for Bill Clinton to 
do his part, to transform the "say anything, but do nothing" presidency 
into one that fulfills its responsibilities.  Republicans challenge Bill 
Clinton to do his part by keeping his campaign promises and start telling 
the truth about Medicare. We challenge him to balance the budget, 
provide tax relief for families and for economic growth, and genuinely 
reform welfare. We challenge him to stop trying to scare senior citizens 
about Medicare and act to preserve it for the next generation. The 
Republican Congress already has done the hard work. They already 
consulted the American people for the best solutions, turned them into 
legislation and passed it. All Clinton has to do is put down his veto pen 
and fulfill his campaign promises by using his pen to sign the Republican 
balanced budget into law.

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wadethe Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortionwe have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusionssuch as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participantsregardless of race, sex, or residencemost often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motivesin some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestringmany have no paid staffand they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobbywe had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do thatthey have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically27 percentwhile the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appealit's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortionlegal or illegaldestroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomesor, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Soaring rates of illegitimacy are threatening America's social fabric. But Members of Congress and state officials, as they wrestle with the problems of reforming America's welfare system, can design a functional public policy to combat adolescent pregnancy and illegitimate births. This policy should be based on personal responsibility, including sexual abstinence.
<p>
	For the last quarter century, government has pursued a pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. This approach has been a costly failure because it generally ignores basic realities of culture and developmental psychology. The "abstinence approach," on the other hand, successfully incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. By inculcating individual "resistance skills," abstinence becomes more firmly established the more widely it is applied, which in turn has a beneficial effect on social norms.
<p>
	In a healthy society, individuals are motivated by hope for the future rather than instant gratification, and rely on social skills rather than technology to overcome interpersonal problems. These are precisely the qualities abstinence promotes. Without personal responsibility, which is recognized throughout society as the basic requirement for life achievement, attempts to reform the current dysfunctional system can have only minor, inconsequential results.

<p>	Taxpayers' money should be used only for social programs that work. If state officials are going to administer these programs, with funding transferred in block grants to the states, they should focus on attacking illegitimacy directly. This includes using funds for abstinence counseling, not merely contraception, and for adoption rather than abortion.1 While plans advanced by the Clinton Administration and the Senate Republican leadership ignore abstinence education as a way to help control illegitimacy, the proposal by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and John Ashcroft (R-MO) earmarks $200 million for such education under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant.2<p>	Young people who want to avoid poverty and dependency can do three things: complete high-school; get a job, even a low-paying one; and have children only within marriage. For several decades, this formula has been ignored in the development of public policy as increasing numbers of unmarried teenage mothers have slipped out of school, out of the economic mainstream, and into dependence. Many remain dependent for long periods of time in spite of attempts by policymakers to reform this key aspect of welfare.3<p>	Responding to growing public concern, President Clinton and many Members of Congress have attempted to focus welfare reform efforts on the illegitimacy crisis. Unfortunately, although official Washington's rhetoric has been stirring, many of these proposals are unchanged from the existing failed strategy.
<p>	While no one can dispute the health advantages of abstinence, and while most people would admit that it is the socially, developmentally, and psychologically appropriate course for an adolescent, there are many who assert that abstinence is impossible for an adolescent. This assertion is groundless. For decades, if not centuries, sexual abstinence was expected of unmarried individuals in Western society. According to the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), abstinence was the norm among unmarried American teenage girls at least until 1982.4 The best of the recent surveys of high school age youth (young people 14-17 years old) was conducted as part of the National Health Interview Survey of 1992. This survey showed that 56.6 percent of adolescents were virgins.5 A series of surveys conducted over the last 25 years by <i>Who's Who Among American Highschool Students</i> shows that only one in four top students is sexually active. This suggests that abstinence is not only possible, but associated with high levels of personal achievement.6<p><b>UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</b><p>	Recognizing the struggles and special needs of single parents, American public policy throughout this century has experimented with various forms of aid. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) began as Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) in the 1935 Social Security Act but was modeled on the cash-grant "Mothers' Aid" programs that various states had developed several decades earlier. As these modest, supervised programs expanded due to legislation, regulations, and court decisions, there was growing concern that for many, welfare dependency was becoming a permanent status, not a transitional phase. A cultural shift accompanied this program expansion: Where previously there was a social and often legal presumption against the ability of an unmarried teenager to raise a child, the perception began to arise that giving birth outside marriage was not only socially acceptable, but also without consequence to children born and raised 
in non-formed families.7<p>	The family is responsible for the basic socialization of children, and when the family breaks down or is never fully formed, children are most affected. They suffer in health, education, and emotional development.8 This is well-documented, but a few facts help to suggest the human impact. White girls growing up fatherless are two and a half times more likely to have a child out of wedlock. For a fatherless white child, the chances of finishing high school drop 40 percent; for a fatherless black child, they drop 70 percent. Yet, as welfare recipients increased in number, in some neighborhoods, children dependent not on a father and mother but on the state became the norm rather than the exception. In these areas, welfare programs are the dominant legal economic force, and recipiency is common among young women.
<p>
	Recognizing that in many communities there is a cycle of poverty, public policy should be concerned about how dependency is transmitted from one generation to the next. Welfare traditionally has focused on adult female recipients; however, their children also merit increased concern. This is especially true for boys growing up without the guidance of fathers in neighborhoods where few boys have the example of fathers who support the family. They are raised by peers on the streets, without social norms, achievable goals, or hope. In the worst cases, their lives are marked by violence and crime, and end early. This is just one more area in which a program meant to do good spawns social disorganization and cultural turmoil.9<p>	Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) relates a conversation between a social scientist who was visiting a poor neighborhood in Chicago and an adolescent living there. The visitor asked the child what she would do when she grew up and was told that she "would draw." Sensing some hope in the bleak surroundings, the visitor asked a follow-up question: "What would you draw?" The girl's answer: "Welfare, like my mother."10 Although the fate of this particular child is not known, examples abound of the subtle yet pervasive draw of welfare in urban areas.<p>	The United States is not alone in its perplexing re-examination of the social effects of such relief programs. A similar review is underway in Britain, where the out-of-wedlock birthrate has risen from 5 percent in 1960 to the current 30 percent. British analysts examining the impact on children note that the weakened family damages society as well, both in taxes and in other social costs, including crime: Armed robberies increased by a factor of eleven in England and Wales between 1970 and 1991.11<p>	The United States is heading in the same direction. Census Bureau figures released in August 1994 show that 19 percent of white children live in single-parent families. Among Hispanics and blacks, the proportions of children living in si
ngle-parent families are 31 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The deleterious influence of single-parent households on welfare costs is apparent to most observers, regardless of political persuasion. Solid welfare reform depends on reducing the proportion of children living in single-parent families. This obviously entails a drastic slowing of illegitimate births, especially illegitimate births to teens. The consensus about illegitimacy and welfare reform breaks down, however, when it comes to how births to unmarried teens are to be reduced. Liberals often recommend increased contraceptive education for teenagers and resort to abortion when contraception fails. Conservatives generally favor a new emphasis on responsibility, virtue, and sexual abstinence in a broad cultural setting.
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND WELFARE REFORM: A CASE STUDY</b>
<p>
	In the 103rd Congress, the Clinton Administration's welfare reform bill (S. 2224) sat sidetracked as intense attention was given health care reform. The bill proposed "to redesign the program of aid to dependent children... [and among other things] prevents dependency.... " Detailed summaries of the bill and Sections 505 and 506 also described the "Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grant Program" by which 1,000 schools and community-based groups would receive grants for "teen pregnancy prevention strategies." Although the bill itself never mentioned the abstinence strategy, this six-page narrative summary includes three surprising references: to "the delay of sexual activity" (twice) and to "premature sexual behavior" (once). Given the growing cultural awareness of the inherent soundness of a prevention strategy based on sexual abstinence, this language seemed to promise dramatic change -- but not for long. These references, when translated into the bureaucratic language of Clinton Administration planners and policies, were contradicted and emptied of meaning.12<p>	<b>Reading the Fine Print.</b> Consider what the Administration meant by "delay of sexual activity" or "premature sexual activity." In the first place, neither "abstinence" nor any related term was to be found in the Administration document. There was no statement that sexual activity is inappropriate for teens or best expressed within marriage. Instead of clearly stating its intentions, the Administration discussed teenage sexual activity with such vague words as "delay" or "premature." Clinton's policy team at the Department of Health and Human Services has a long track record of using ordinary language in misleading ways. For instance, sexual intercourse is "premature" for pre-teens or early teens (11 or 13-year-olds) and should be "delayed" until the age of 16 or 17 years, at which point programs that teach sexual "delay" can shift to contraceptive education. The basis for this educational shift was apparent in the language of the bill summary:
<blockquote>
	Particular emphasis must be paid to the delay of sexual activity and prevention of pregnancy before marriage. Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise, especially for adolescents who are motivated to avoid pregnancy until they are married.
</blockquote>
	It becomes apparent that "delay of sexual activity" and "prevention of pregnancy" are two very different and contradictory directions.
<p>
	The Clinton document is further decoded by examining the next sentence: "Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise." The word "combine" refers to the current vogue in sex education of giving the "delay/abstinence" message to young children and then "combining" it with the contraceptive strategy for middle and older teens. Although touted as having "the most promise," this approach has not been effective; only the abstinence component has shown any positive effect.13<p>	These combination programs are called "abstinence plus" by their supporters, largely because they find a way to include the government contraceptive promotion programs that planners favor. The notion that adolescent sexual activity can be divided into two categories -- premature and mature -- did not originate with the policymakers of the Clinton Administration.14 Yet only in a time of policy confusion could such a notion gain a foothold in government programs. Like "safe drug use," "mature adolescent sexual activity" is a contradiction in terms.<p><b>EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL RESPONSE TO UNWED PREGNANCY</b><p>	Expert opinion about teenage pregnancy has undergone continuous change through the last three decades. The grave consequences of high rates of illegitimate births among blacks were first brought to the public's attention by Senator Moynihan in the early 1960s when he was a policy advisor in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the time Moynihan issued his first earnest warnings, the proportion of illegitimate births among blacks was about 28 percent -- slightly less than the proportion in society at large today.
<p>
	In the late 1960s, rising levels of premarital sexual activity among many ethnic groups led to concern about the epidemic of births to teenagers. This notion of an epidemic of teen births flourished among policymakers and the public for two decades, despite the fact that demographers such as Maris Vinovskis have shown that the teenage birth rate fell steadily through the 1960s and 1970s. Even a pause in this decline in the late 1980s did not erase the fact that the birth rate to teenage mothers is significantly less now than forty years ago. The number of births to unmarried teens, however, has risen dramatically. The understanding that the epidemic of births to teen mothers is really an epidemic of illegitimacy did not gain currency among policymakers until the 1990s.
<p>
	The success of programs designed to resolve social problems such as teen illegitimacy depends on how those problems are defined. To talk of an "epidemic of births" among teens suggests that teen pregnancy is a medical problem, which in turn suggests that medical science can produce a remedy. In the minds of many social scientists and government policymakers, the obvious answer to this supposed medical problem was to provide teens with birth control drugs and devices. Thus, the federal government's formal family planning program, Title X, passed in 1970 with the general understanding that it would continue to follow the practice of previous efforts by providing services only to married women, soon became strongly oriented to providing contraceptives to unmarried teens.15<p>	Due to the huge growth in the number of abortions among adolescents during the middle and late 1970s, the number of births to teenage mothers declined while the number of teen pregnancies rose dramatically. By the mid-1980s, efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy through sex education and contraception were having no beneficial effect -- perhaps even a deleterious effect.16 About this time, however, it was becoming clear that AIDS also could be a disease of heterosexuals. Very quickly, the problem of teenage sexuality was redefined: The major threat now was sexually transmitted disease.
<p>
	Until a few years ago, the prevailing view among health educators such as Debra Haffner17 was that it was useless to try to frighten teenagers with the consequences of sexual activity. Increasing fear about AIDS, for instance, would render teens unable to take positive action, such as condom use, which could reduce the risk of AIDS transmission. Of course, in this view, the possibility of paralyzing teenagers with fear went only so far; they did not believe, for instance, that fear-induced paralysis would render teenagers reluctant or unable to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
	The evolution of sex education programs has been described at length by Douglas Kirby, Ph.D., of ETR Associates in Scotts Valley, California. Kirby has categorized sex education curricula into four generations. The first generation "focused primarily on increasing students' knowledge about sexuality and on emphasizing the risks and consequences of pregnancy."18 The second placed more emphasis on values clarification and decision-making skills. The third developed "in reaction or opposition to" the first two. Kirby describes the third generation in the following terms:
<blockquote>
	Concerned that the first two generations of programs were "value free," and supported by a moralistic and ideological fervor, a different group of people developed programs consistently emphasizing the message that young people should not engage in intercourse until marriage. To avoid any possibility of a double message, these programs commonly did not discuss contraception.19</blockquote>	The fourth generation of programs, including one of Kirby's, "represents a synthesis of the first three." These programs "are neither value-free nor moralistic.... Instead, they emphasize that it is a good idea for young teenagers to delay sex and that it is important for all young people to practice effective contraception if they are going to have sex."20<p>	Kirby notes that the first generation of programs imparted knowledge about sex but failed to achieve the desired results: "It has subsequently become more widely recognized... that knowledge about issues such as contraception is only weakly related to behavior, and that increased knowledge may not produce much of a reduction in risk-taking behavior."21 As for the second generation, which stressed values clarification, "when specific values were not given prominent emphasis in the course, there was little evidence of impact."22 Kirby concedes that the third generation (based on abstinence) managed in the short run to change attitudes about premarital intercourse. With regard to changing behavior through abstinence, Kirby remarks that few published studies have examined this topic and notes that "the methods used in those studies have been somewhat limited, but thus far those evaluations indicate that the programs did not delay intercourse or reduce frequency of intercourse."23<p>	Kirby reserves his praise for fourth-generation programs, which he says have shown an ability to delay the initiation of intercourse. He arrives at this result by assigning a program, Postponing Sexual Involvement, to the fourth generation despite the fact that it was funded by the federa
l government as an abstinence-only program. To justify his categorization, Kirby argues that "Although the program focused on delaying sexual intercourse, Postponing Sexual Involvement was not moralistic, and it differed in other important ways from the third generation of programs."24 The nature of these important differences is never explained.
<p>
	This account of the evolution of teen pregnancy prevention programs is artificial and does not comport fully with the classifications of funding agencies. Moreover, Kirby's classifications dilute the effect of abstinence-only programs. Programs that are similar in content and approach are segregated according to whether they are considered moralistic. This points out a central feature of the academic discussion of adolescent sex: Academics and policymakers generally focus only on the physical consequences of sexual activity, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Psychological and spiritual consequences of early sexual involvement rarely receive consideration. Even topics like the coercion of teenage girls by older males, which would seem certain to elicit strong reactions, until very recently have not garnered much attention from academics and policymakers.
<p>
	Though Kirby's analysis fails to give abstinence programs the credit they deserve, it does contain some interesting news: Abstinence programs can be successful without an overt appeal to traditional morality. There appears to be enough evidence about the health and career advantages of abstinence to persuade most young adolescents that it is the best course to follow. Indeed, overt appeals to morality actually may work against the success of an abstinence program for certain teenage audiences. For those adolescents who regard themselves more as consumers in a marketplace of ideas than as heirs to the intellectual heritage of their parents, traditional values and good ideas must be marketed creatively.
<p>
	Fourth-generation, or "abstinence plus," sex education programs are sophisticated and well-presented but have not demonstrated success in delaying the initiation of sexual activity. They can claim success only by defining it in very broad terms. They claim success when sexual initiation is delayed, when frequency of sexual activity is decreased, or when contraceptive use is increased. Promoters of "abstinence-only" programs in general do not even bother to measure frequency of sexual activity or use of contraceptives, for they realize that social and psychological damage results from the premature initiation of sexual activity. Using contraceptives merely avoids part of the adverse consequences of sex for a teen.
<p>
	Ignoring the psychological realities of teenage sex also helps demonstrate why "abstinence plus" programs are not likely to be successful. Teenagers in these programs understand that they are being offered two mutually exclusive lines of behavior by adults associated with trusted institutions. If these options are presented as equally good, teens naturally will pick the one that costs them less -- or, put another way, that forces them to relinquish less. It is no surprise that even highly touted "abstinence plus" programs such as Reducing the Risk have not managed to increase abstinence.
<p>

<b>ADOLESCENTS AND THE RISKS THEY FACE</b>
<p>
	Many adolescents face multiple risks in the transition to adulthood: lack of future orientation and discipline, poverty, dropping out of school, family instability, pressures for sexual activity, alcohol and drug abuse. Although adolescents, because of their developmental status, tend to misunderstand and minimize the seriousness of these risks, the phenomenon is more pronounced in youths who lack real direction in their lives.25<p>	Teenagers generally have other developmental limitations as well. According to developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, adolescents are incapable of the intimacy that comes with committed love. Also, on the practical side, adolescents are poor and inconsistent contraceptors even though current oral contraceptives are low-dose formulations that should be taken every day at the same time.
<p>
	In dealing with children with multiple risks, the Clinton Administration argues that "for those populations where adolescent pregnancy is a symptom of deeper problems, education and contraceptive services alone will be inadequate; they must be part of a much wider spectrum of services." This correctly identifies the need for intensive services for adolescents who believe, because of cultural or peer pressure, that having children out of wedlock is a desirable goal. One defect of this strategy, however, is the inclusion of the contraceptive element; adolescents would be left to the same risks and cultural pressures, only with suggestions to go about them more carefully. This guarantees that the "new" approach would collapse upon itself.
<p>
	<b>Personal Responsibility.</b> A safe transition to adulthood requires the development of self-respect, self-restraint, and orientation to achievable life goals, summed up in the traditional recognition that the successful and good life requires the cultivation of virtue. Adult direction, good counsel along the way, and growth in virtue are all essential to youth. Yet adolescents with multiple risks (such as unformed families, low levels of education, or low socioeconomic status) are excluded all but systematically from this vision of life; it is assumed to be impossible for them. At the same time, they are exposed constantly to the most self-destructive behaviors, including illegal drug and alcohol use. Adolescents at high risk for self-destructive behavior also have the greatest need for life orientation, hope, and virtue.
<P>
	If personal virtue is the key to responsible adulthood, programs that claim to prevent dependency must address the real needs of adolescents by focusing on these elements and equipping young people for adult responsibilities. Any other program modifications will not be worth the effort.
<P>

<b>TEENS, CONTRACEPTION, AND BIRTH</b>
<p>
	Casual observers often attribute the rise in single-parent households to a putative rise in the teen birth rate. This is not entirely accurate. As noted above, historically speaking, the teen birth rate is at a low level. The National Center for Health Statistics makes this point precisely: In 1970 the birth rate for 15-19 year olds was 68.3 for every thousand girls of that age; in 1992, it was 60.7. During the same period, the rate of births to unmarried teens almost doubled, rising from 22.4 per thousand to 44.6 per thousand.26 Nevertheless, the birthrate for unmarried teens is still less than the birthrate for unmarried women in their twenties. It is these illegitimate births among adolescents and young adults which have particular relevance to welfare programs and policies. The epidemic of illegitimacy among all age groups is a cultural rather than a biological or technical problem. The remedy must be cultural as we<p>

	President Clinton's Work and Responsibility Act of 1994 is probably a good indication of future liberal policy proposals. It acknowledged that the increase in illegitimate births to adolescent mothers has a serious impact on the nation's social welfare system, and Sections 505 and 506 ostensibly answered the problem of births to unwed teenage mothers. Unfortunately, it seems the Clinton plan tried to rectify the problem of early unwed motherhood through sex education and school-based clinics featuring contraception. The Work and Responsibility Act presupposed these techniques would cause teens to have intercourse in ways that reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. The Act identified this as "sexual responsibilit<p>

	This attempt to make sexual activity safe for teens is not novel; its failures are visible everywhere. Except for a pause in the early 1980s, pregnancy rates for 15-19 year olds have risen over the last 25 years to the present high of 111 pregnancies for every thousand girl<p>

	Another unfortunate physical consequence of the attempt to render sex safe for teens is an epidemic of sexually transmitted disease. The U.S. Public Health Service estimated in 1989 that one in four sexually active teens will be infected eventually with a sexually transmitted disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control estimate that there are at least 12 million new cases of such disease every year. Since many sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, herpes, genital warts, and hepatitis B have a viral etiology, they are incurable. Because viral STDs are lifelong, some estimates suggest that one in five Americans eventually will contract a viral STD.27 Obviously, not all of these people are adolescents, but in an era of multiple sexual partners, everyone in the pool of sexually active people is at risk<p>	In addition, certain nonphysical dangers of early sexuality often are ignored, either because they are not visible or because they are not easily quantifiable. Poor academic grades and a decrease in orientation toward the future have been documented among adolescents who initiated sexual intercourse prior to marriage.28 Unfortunately, disillusionment with life (sometimes called a broken spirit) is a consequence that is not susceptible to public health analysis.<P>	Family disruption and a tendency to engage in other risky behaviors such as drinking also are associated with early sexual activity. Recent studies performed for the state of Illinois by John Vessey, Ph.D., of Northwestern University quantify several risk factors for premarital sexual activity. Not having two parents in the home and believing that parents accept adolescent sexual activity are associated with a doubling of the chances that a teen will have premarital sex. Smoking and frequent drinking are associated, respectively, with fourfold and sixfold increases in the likelihood of premarital sex. Believing that condoms are safe is associated with a fivefold increase.29<P><b>REASONS FOR FAILURE OF "RESPONSIBLE TEEN SEX"30</b><P>	
The inability of adolescents to shield themselves from the adverse consequences of early sexual activity is not due to poor technology. Theoretically, there is not much room for improvement in the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (oral pills or implanted capsules). There may be some room to reduce their unhealthful or unpleasant side effects, but the natural tendency of scientific research is to concentrate on the more important risks, such as breast cancer, heart attack, or stroke, rather than on minor side effects like acne, weight gain, or hair loss that are important to image-conscious teenagers. Considering the purpose of hormonal contraception -- to alter the natural process of ovulation --some side effects are unavoidable.
<P>	By far the greatest impediments to efficient pregnancy prevention through contraceptives are human error and failure to use these devices. According to one large, well-controlled study, 58 percent of women forgot to take their oral contraceptive pills every day, and 80 percent failed to take them at the same time every day as prescribed.31 This study included women of all ages, with the mean age over 20; it is recognized generally that the level of compliance with contraception protocols among teenagers is much worse than for the population of women as a whole. This helps explain why there are millions of unplanned pregnancies even though 90.1 percent of sexually active American women use some type of contraception.32 Failure to comply with professionals' prescriptions must be regarded as one of the immutable facts of contraceptive life.
<P>
	It may be argued that failure to follow medical recommendations does not affect so-called passive methods of contraception, such as Norplant. Hence, when Norplant was approved for the market in 1991, many family planning advocates hailed it as the "magic bullet" that would end unintended pregnancy among teenagers and others likely to forget their pills. Within months, all state Medicaid programs were paying for Norplant.
<P>
	Researchers became concerned that the euphoria surrounding the arrival of a low-effort, long-term contraceptive might cause users to become careless about their reproductive health practices. With funds from the U.S. Public Health Service, a large study was initiated on a population of Medicaid women in Arkansas, one of the leading states in Norplant use. The study confirms some of the fears of reproductive health professionals: Medicaid women with Norplant are more likely to miss regularly scheduled gynecological screenings, more likely to contract sexually transmitted diseases, and less likely to get needed services. This study contains no information on whether individuals with Norplant have more sexual partners, though such data certainly would be relevant to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.33 Another large study, conducted in Baltimore to compare adolescent and adult Norplant users, revealed that only 13-18 percent of users returned for their routine follow-up examinations.34<P>	When confronted with the failure of prescription contraceptives to protect against sexually transmitted disease, proponents of birth control for adolescents respond with condoms. But family planning professionals historically have been reluctant to recommend condoms for pregnancy prevention because of their high failure rate. The contraceptive failure rate among young, low-income women who use condoms, oral contraceptives, or diaphragms is shown below.<P>	 These rates reflect failure to prevent pregnancy. There are no specific data about the failure rate of barrier contraceptive methods in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. Some published studies indicate slippage and breakage rates exceeding 14 percent, even among experienced condom users.35 It would be a mistake, however, to equate every instance of slippage and breakage with an accidental pregnancy or the transmission of a disease. Condoms often slip or break without resulting in an STD or a pregnancy; conversely, an STD or a pregnancy can occur in spite o
f an intact condom. Even an intact condom cannot necessarily prevent the spread of serious sexually transmitted diseases. Human papillomavirus (HPV), the agent which causes genital warts and the root cause of most of the nation's 6,000 cervical cancer deaths per year, can exist in parts of the genital region not covered by condoms.36<P>	<b>Teens and Condoms.</b> In view of high contraceptive failure rates, responsible reproductive health professionals have concluded that the minimum standard for reducing the chances of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease is to use a hormonal method and a barrier method simultaneously. This "dual use" is what the Public Health Service recommended in 1990 as a fallback position for adolescents who do not remain abstinent.37 More recently, Dr. David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, correctly decried the tendency of health professionals to give dangerously insufficient advice regarding contraception: "you don't hear people saying use Norplant plus a condom... or oral contraceptives plus a condom. That's not being said and it needs to be said."38<P>	Unfortunately, family planning professionals have neglected this message. Perhaps they are reluctant to spread the message of dual use because they recognize that it complicates sexual activity and, thus, that many sexually active people will be loath to heed it. Acceptance of dual contraceptive methods is very low; the Public Health Service estimates that only 2 percent of sexually active teens attain even this insufficient standard of risk reduction.39<P>	What dooms dual use as a means of risk reduction for teens is what has always plagued barrier methods and hormonal contraceptives separately: Many adolescents simply do not want to use them. This indifference to contraception points to a central fact of developmental psychology: that teenagers and adults evaluate risks differently. The cognitive pattern that characterizes most people in early and middle adolescence (sometimes called concrete operational t
hought) is characterized by haphazard processing of information and failure to anticipate future outcomes of actions.40 This predisposition makes it difficult for teens to use contraception effectively and consistently. In many cases, their low ability to take positive action to reduce the risks associated with sex is impaired further by drugs or alcohol. The failure to take these facts into account has undermined many pregnancy prevention programs, especially those based on contraception.<P>
	The contraceptive approach to adolescent pregnancy prevention faces also more formidable obstacles than teenagers' psychological disinclination to use inconvenient contraceptive methods. In some areas, statistics show that 70-90 percent of the children of teenage mothers were fathered by men in their twenties.41 Thus, what is commonly described as the teen pregnancy problem actually involves more than teenagers.<P>	Men in their twenties enjoy a certain status with teenage girls simply because of their age. In the current social climate, there is little disadvantage to a young adult male in fathering a child out of wedlock. Perversely, he incurs financial responsibilities only if he admits paternity. In many states, a declaration of paternity made in the hospital when his child is born has no legal effect; he must repeat the statement in court. These slightly older men are not above using force or coercion to make sexual conquests. Social science research only recently has begun to plumb the depths of coercive sex suffered by teenagers.42 It is no wonder that in a national survey, a plurality of teens regarded pressure to have sex as the greatest threat to their well-being.43<P>	The fact that men who impregnate teenage girls are often in their twenties points to a serious problem in current adolescent pregnancy-prevention programs: We cannot reach these young adults with school-based campaigns. These young men are not impressed with any contraceptive method because fathering a child out of wedlock brings them only advantages (unless they marry). Previous cultural and legal prohibitions about older males' being involved sexually with teens have loosened. As damaging as this is in itself, it leads to another problem: Teenage males, who tend to model their actions on the behavior of their slightly older counterparts, try to act out their own version of this life. Thus, a vicious cycle is born. In terms of sexually transmitted disease, substance abuse, and non-marital sexual activity, the early twenties are an 
even more troubled age than the teen years.
<P>

<b>FALSE DIAGNOSES</b>
<P>
	Adolescents do not lack information about sex. Aside from the continual media onslaught, there are numerous sources of formal education about sexuality, contraception, and sexually transmitted disease. A recent survey shows that 93 percent of U.S. high schools offer classes on sexuality and AIDS.44 According to a national study of 15-19 year old males, a large majority (79 percent) had received formal instruction about birth control. Unfortunately, only 58 percent had received formal instruction about resisting pressure to engage in sexual activity.45<P>	It is also clear that the high rate of repeat pregnancy among teens cannot be attributed to ignorance about sexual matters. A study of contraceptive use and repeat pregnancy among welfare-dependent teenage mothers found that half had become pregnant again within two years even though the majority were using some method of contraception.46<P>	<b>Funding for Pregnancy Prevention.</b> Despite its frequent portrayal as a national problem, federal funding for adolescent contraception is ample. Overall, the federal government spends about $1 billion per year on family planning. These expenditures include Title X of the Public Health Service Act (family planning for low-income persons) and Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid, which pays for more contraceptive services than any other program), but not matching funds from the states or other institutions. Judging from the age distribution of Title X clients, about $300 million of this money is devoted to adolescents each year. On the other hand, the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, which runs the only federal program dedicated to promoting sexual abstinence (Title XX of the Public Health Service Act), spends about $1.9 million for that purpose annually. If there is a funding problem for adolescent sexuality programs, it is only that current funding is misdirected.47<P>	Asked to explain the absence of evidence that their programs work, proponents of contraceptive education fall back on arguments
 of "face validity." All this means is that, on its face, a program seems as if it ought to work. When "experts" state that contraceptive education programs have "face validity," they are saying that they believe imparting information, regardless of its quality or evidence of any effect, is good. Yet proponents of abstinence in Congress and elsewhere have not been able to invoke face validity to support their programs. In the hands of abstinence proponents, face validity is considered offensively moralistic. Thus, in a field with a perennial scarcity of solid data, policy arguments all favor the contraceptive side.
<P>
	Without any persuasive evidence that it benefits adolescent development, or that it is effective when used, the contraceptive approach is regarded most appropriately not as a pragmatic policy choice, but as an ideology, though admittedly one that remains widely respected.48<P><b>WHAT WORKS TO REDUCE ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY</b><P>
	When seeking what works to reduce teenage pregnancy, federal and state policymakers should not search primarily among federal government programs. Some successes have been achieved in the Title XX Adolescent Family Life program, but its tiny size and the bureaucratic and legislative constraints under which it labors have prevented it from having a substantial impact.49<P>	The Title XX program does serve, however, as a useful point of departure in exploring successful abstinence programs. The program funded ground-breaking research on the precursors and consequences of sexual activity among unmarried adolescents. Among its findings were that a family's pattern of communication affected the abstinence behavior of adolescents. In particular, good communication between adolescents and their mothers tended to promote abstinent behavior. Title XX-funded research also documented that adolescent initiation of sexual intercourse had a negative effect on the reported academic grades of white males, as well as on the college aspirations of white females.50<P>	Influenced perhaps by polls which found that 65 percent of teenagers thought the most effective way to convince their peers to postpone sex would be to describe the dangers of diseases like herpes and AIDS,51 many early Title XX programs emphasized the adverse consequences of early sexuality. This approach failed for two major reasons. First, these programs tried to focus teens' attention on the grim facts of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease while AIDS advocates and most of the public health establishment were asserting that grim outcomes generally could be avoided with condoms. Second, the adverse consequences approach did not give sufficient weight to the statements of adolescents who actually had abstained. According to a poll of adolescents who abstained (the Gallup Study of American Youth, 1977-1988), 55 percent were concerned about pregnancy, but 75 percent wanted to save sex until marriage.
<P>
	Nabers Cabaniss Johnson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 1987-1990 and director of the Title XX program, credited a project conducted by the Search Institute of Minnesota with finding that "knowledge alone has little effect on sexual decision-making and that teens' own values and strength of conviction about what is right far outweigh peer pressure or fear of consequences."52<P>	Willingness to abstain, then, is the heart of the matter. It is unlikely that the desire to wait can be taught in the didactic sense. But if the culture at large, the neighborhood culture, or even the subculture at school supports the virtue of abstinence, well-designed programs can help a teen to practice it. Abstinence programs over the years have developed effective methods, such as resistance skills, which teens can use to implement their convictions. American culture must provide the concepts of virtue toward which adolescents can strive.
<P>
	The Title XX program has funded about 75 abstinence projects across the country since 1981. Remarkably, by law, this portion of Title XX could be no more than half as big as the portion devoted to caring for teens already pregnant or rearing young children. The abstinence projects were located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Because Title XX was a demonstration program, the projects it funded generally were quite small.
<P>
<b>DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS OF ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS</b>
<P>
	Ideological opponents of the abstinence approach, such as former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, suggest that abstinence cannot be promoted successfully among teens. Yet even those who oppose abstinence programs recognize that the small projects funded by Title XX generally have produced favorable cognitive and attitudinal results. These programs meet the standard stated by the summary of Sections 505 and 506 in the Clinton plan, and yet they have no real chance of approval as part of the Clinton Administration's program.
<P>	The "gold standard" among sex education or abstinence programs is not whether they increase knowledge, or even whether they change attitudes. The important achievement is to affect behavior. In this regard, the Title XX program has enjoyed notable success.53<P>	A program called Preventing Sexual Involvement (PSI) was conducted by Emory University faculty members at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1983. Since it received funding under Title XX, it was by definition an abstinence-only program. The study population was entirely urban, poor, and African-American. A scientific evaluation of PSI showed that adolescents who went through the program were significantly less likely to initiate sexual activity than similar adolescents in a control group. The beneficial results were recorded in a Public Health Service document entitled "Adolescent Family Life Program; Highlights from Prevention Projects":
<blockquote>
	During the year that the students participated (eighth grade), nonprogram students were five times more likely to begin sexual activity during the school year than were program students (20 percent vs. 4 percent). The differences were greater for girls (15 percent vs. 1 percent) than they were for boys (29 percent vs. 8 percent). At the end of the ninth grade, the differences between non-program and program students continued (39 percent vs. 24 percent) even though no additional program involvement was provided.
</blockquote>
	Another program which apparently has reduced the level of sexual activity among adolescents is Reducing the Risk (RTR). Unlike PSI, RTR was not eligible for Title XX funding because it included a contraception message in addition to its abstinence message. The scientific evaluations of both programs specifically attribute resulting favorable changes in behavior to their abstinence components. As Kirby states in his evaluation of RTR, "In combination with the findings from the evaluation of PSI, this suggests that it may actually be easier to delay the onset of sexual activity than to increase contraceptive practice."54<P>	Another Title XX abstinence project was conducted by the American Home Economics Association. An independent analysis of data from Project Taking Charge, made by a federal evaluator, showed that this project also reduced the likelihood of premarital sexual activity among adolescents who participated in the program.55<P>	<b>Adolescent Acceptance of Abstinence.</b> Other successful abstinence programs have been developed without funding from Title XX or any other government source. In the schools of Conway, Arkansas (population 38,000), a concerned parent named Thelma Moton and a group of volunteers have conducted the EXCEL program for three years. EXCEL accepts no government funds because of an abiding belief that promoting civic virtue is a community's own responsibility. With the expertise of volunteers from among medical professionals, educators, parents, and older students, EXCEL has provided semester-long programs for 1,300 junior high students each year. Though a scientific evaluation of the program has just been initiated, a preliminary survey showed that 27 percent of students in the program were sexually active as opposed to 31 percent of those who were not in the program.
<P>
	The EXCEL program makes good use of the prestige of senior high school students willing to "admit" that they have not engaged in sex. Younger students report that they are relieved to hear these "admissions" because they remove the peer pressure to engage in risky activities. EXCEL uses the same method to reduce other risky behaviors such as drinking and drug use.
<P>
	Like PSI and RTR, EXCEL teaches refusal skills, or methods by which students can resist pressure from peers to indulge in sex, drinking, or drugs without becoming a social outcast. Refusal skills are practiced through role-playing and are considered crucial by the EXCEL staff. According to Thelma Moton, "If you don't have refusal skills, you don't have a program."56 Practicing refusal skills is common in successful risk-reduction programs. Clearly, today's adolescent culture filters out fewer expressions of deviancy. Though this creates a more tolerant society in a superficial sense, it also generates more overt pressure on teens to participate in activities they may consider frightening.

<P>	Contrary to the expectations of many adults, the majority of teens seem interested in what abstinence-based programs might have to offer. A survey of 1,000 girls conducted by Emory University found that of a dozen possible sex education topics, the most popular (chosen by 84 percent of the respondents) was more information on how to say "no" to a boyfriend's requests for sex without losing the boyfriend.57 It is also evident from a February 1994 Roper Starch poll that 12-17 year olds regard the pressure to have sex as the prime threat to their well-being.58 It seems obvious that adolescents have been calling on adults to protect them with reasonable behavioral limits. For many years, however, the vogue in child-rearing was to ignore such calls.<P>	Another common characteristic of successful programs is an approach that recognizes and responds to the needs of the individual.59 For example, Washington, D.C.'s Best Friends program, directed by Elayne Bennett, works with girls who are at high risk for adolescent pregnancy. It asks them to remain abstinent through completion of high school. By pairing each girl in a mentoring relationship with a mature, stable woman, the program takes advantage of adolescents' tendency to model their behavior on the actions of slightly older people, thus starting what might be called a virtuous cycle. It also builds group identity and celebrates life events, such as completion of the school year and academic success. As of 1993, Best Friends had graduated over 500 young women without a single instance of pregnancy.
<P>	Further evidence that abstinence programs can have a positive effect on children with multiple risks is found in the Hoyleton project. Evaluators of this East St. Louis, Illinois, project funded by the Title XX abstinence program found that it combines classroom instruction with an after-school program to channel the energies and promote the further development of children enrolled in the classroom element. In addition, it involves parents as the primary sexuality educators of their children and provides academic tutoring, field trips, and games. This program attempts explicitly to change the cultural influences on children, thereby helping to give them a new vision of the possibilities beyond their present circumstances. This would be accomplished by helping teenagers avoid sexual activity, drug, and alcohol use, all of which are symptomatic of crisis in adolescents.
<P>
	The programs that work are the ones that focus on adolescents as individuals during the transition to adulthood, a time fraught with risk, especially for those with weak or nonexistent parental assistance or other adult role models. These programs recognize, implicitly or explicitly, that the rise in adolescent pregnancy has significant psychological and cultural implications. Therefore, their approach is not merely to give large numbers of teens more information. Programs that have relied simply on dispensing information have not been successful in reducing teen pregnancies, whether the information was on abstinence or contraception.
<P>

<b>WHAT POLICYMAKERS CAN DO</b>
<P>

<b>1) Employ abstinence counseling.</b>
<P>
	Considering that about one young woman in five makes her first family planning visit before initiating sexual activity, there is a strong possibility that abstinence counseling could be effective.60 Directive abstinence counseling has not been tried widely because it runs counter to the philosophical views of most family planning clinicians. But directive counseling is accepted and encouraged with respect to contraception. As we have seen, it is regarded by some experts as essential to gaining contraceptive compliance from teenagers.61 If directive counseling can persuade teens to use certain types of contraception, there should be no ethical objection to using it to promote abstinence.
<P>
	If the teen already is sexually active, counseling could be geared toward what some teens describe as "secondary virginity." At least one survey has discovered that many teens who have had one occasion of sexual intercourse view it as an aberration they are unlikely to repeat.62<P><b>2) Promote adoption counseling.</b><P>	In cases where pregnancy already has occurred, adoption can break the cycle of welfare dependence. Despite its overwhelmingly positive outcome, however, only rarely is adoption described as an option by counselors who favor the contraceptive approach to reducing births among teens.63<P><b>3) Establish parity for abstinence programs.</b><P>	Congress is considering block grants as a major part of welfare reform. Abstinence programs can help stem the tide of early teen sexual involvement, but they must be accorded the same treatment that state and federally funded contraceptive programs now enjoy. Block grants should provide that opportunity. At the state level, officials can plant well-designed programs across communities so that they support each other and achieve a critical mass. The goal of government-supported abstinence campaigns is not necessarily to make it possible for every adolescent to be in a government-funded abstinence program. Rather, the idea is to make communities aware that government tangibly supports the idea of adolescent development rooted in abstinence, risk avoidance, and the attainment of positive life goals.
<P>
	In an era when teens spend an average of 80 hours per week watching TV or listening to the radio,64 it would be of inestimable value for state and local officials to provide grants to local private organizations for media campaigns to support the idea of abstinence -- for example, to disabuse teens of the idea that they are the last virgins in their schools or neighborhoods.65 Teens respond more to what they believe their peers are doing than to what their peers actually do. The success of local and nationwide abstinence promotion efforts like True Love Waits, which has been recognized even by national news magazines, demonstrates that teens will take up the abstinence message gladly if given a rallying point.
<P>

<b>THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION: MASSIVE CULTURAL REALIGNMENT </b>
<P>
	"Abandoning the poor" is hardly a responsible position, yet AFDC, as we know it, itself abandons the poor. More taxpayers today are aware that AFDC recipients who enter the program as adolescent mothers will be the longest recipients, will remain mired in poverty, and most likely will never marry or complete high school. At best, AFDC provides some income support for poor mothers and their children. At worst, it perpetuates cultural patterns that encourage illegitimacy, family non-formation, and difficulties for mothers and children steeped in the subculture of dependency.
<P>
	The roots of today's dependency problem lie in a lack of hope for any achievable life goals and the collapse of cultural support for marriage and removal of any shame or stigma attached to illegitimacy. When this is recognized by those who make public policy, truly creative responses to the needs of these young women can be crafted. At the same time, promotion of abstinence, personal respect, and responsibility must be the "new" approach in any welfare reform proposals geared to preventing dependency. Abstinence programs must be part of a whole, unambiguous cultural message that promotes responsibility in all facets of life, including the sexual. Abstinence is the hallmark of responsibility. This message must be directed at both sexes and at all ages.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<P>	Well-designed abstinence programs can help teens as individuals, but the environment in which they live is also important.66 Thus, it is necessary for state and local policymakers to support efforts, such as the Hoyleton project in East St. Louis and similar programs, which promote positive cultural influences in the lives of adolescents.<P>	The Clinton Administration's claim that responsibility means using a contraceptive during non-marital sex turns the concept of responsibility on its head. The failed and feeble notion of sexual responsibility embodied in the Administration's Work and Responsibility Act would infect every program that accepts it. Participants would soon perceive that "responsibility" is a matter not of choices and behavior, but of acquiring new technology (or merely new terminology).
<P>
	Policymakers instead should promote reforms that encourage personal responsibility. Only this can rescue another generation from dependency. Such a program would represent a true commitment to young people in their struggle to deal with difficult life issues. It would help them form and reach achievable goals, would give them hope, and would increase their chances of becoming responsible adults.

<li>The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal focuses abstinence education on the social, psychological, and health gains of abstaining from sexual activity while unmarried; backs abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage as the "expected standard" for school-age children; teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; teaches that marriage is the "expected standard" of human sexual activity; teaches that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have "harmful psychological and physical effects"; and teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have "harmful consequences" for the child, his parents, and society.

<li>The measure of behavioral change usually is sexual activity, which is difficult to measure. At best, programs which have attempted to measure this variable have relied on the self-reporting of adolescents. Some analysts have suggested strongly that adolescents greatly exaggerate their sexual activity. Males, "School Age Pregnancy:  Why Hasn't Prevention Worked?"  Considering some of the extreme reports that have appeared recently in the social science literature -- for example, that 13 percent of ten-year-old girls and 28 percent of ten-year-old boys in an urban population had initiated sexual intercourse -- it seems likely that the self reports are exaggerated. D. Romer <i>et al.</i>, "Social Influences on the Sexual Behavior of Youth at Risk for HIV Exposure," <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>, Vol. 84, No. 6 (June 1994), pp. 977-985. This tendency to exaggerate coital activity is an important factor in teen sexuality because teens are highly influenced in their sexual behavior by what they think their peers are doing. This becomes a vicious cycle because teens consistently overestimate the sexual activity of their peers.

Backgrounder No. 1045<br>July 27, 1995<br><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%> <p></center><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>	With the national out-of-wedlock birthrate heading toward 40 percent by the year 2000, and 50 percent around the year 2012, lawmakers are concerned about the increase in abused and neglected children which likely will accompany this disturbing trend. There now are close to 500,000 children in the foster care system,2 but only about 50,000 are cleared for adoption each year. Because of bureaucratic obstacles, many of these children cannot find a permanent, loving home.3<p>	The comprehensive House welfare reform bill (H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act) tries to address this problem by rewarding states for reducing their out-of-wedlock birthrate without resorting to abortion. But another way is to increase early adoptions of neglected children. During the congressional debate, some Members balked at trying to reduce the illegitimacy rate, fearing they might appear harsh or uncaring toward the young unwed mother and her child. For these lawmakers and others with similar apprehensions, adoption is a solution that is kind to both mother and child. Its advantage is well documented:  a better life.
<p>
	The House-passed tax reform bill (H.R. 1215) also encourages adoption. To help defray the significant costs involved, a couple whose income is below $60,000 receives a $5,000 tax credit. This credit is reduced gradually for couples with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and phased out at incomes above $100,000. While significant, however, this step will not lead to a major increase in adoption unless the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy are removed by congressional and state action.
<P>
	Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted. Yet public interest has increased:  close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<P>
	Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<P>
	The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<P>
<B>What the federal government should do:</B>
<P><ul>
<LI> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.<P>

<li> Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.<P>

<LI> Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.<P>

<LI> Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.<P>

<LI> Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.<P>

<LI> Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.<P>

<li> Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<LI> Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
<P></ul>
<b>What the states should do:</b>
<P><ul>
<li> Privatize adoption services.
<P>
<LI> Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<P>
<LI> Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<LI> Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<P>
<LI> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<P>
<li> Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<P>
<li> Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<LI> Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<LI> Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li> Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<LI> Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<P>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<LI> Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><P>

	Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.

<P>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
	Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent:  from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.4<p>	The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).5  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
	Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.6  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers7 and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,8 that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.9<p><b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b><p>	The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.10<p><ul><li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.11  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.12<p><li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.13<p><li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.14<p><li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.<p><li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.15</ul><p>	There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 199
1.16  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"17 homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<P>
	The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.18  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.19  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.20<P>	Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.21  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) last year to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.22  The bill was not enacted.<P><b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b><P><b>Benefits for Children</b><P>	Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.23  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<P><ul>
<LI>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.24<P><LI>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.25<P><LI>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.26<P><LI>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.27<P><LI>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.28<P><LI>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.29<P><LI>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.30<p><LI>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.31<P></ul>	Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.32  Results from the survey were compared across four groups:  adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:<P>* Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;33<p>* Have superior access to health care compare
d to all the other groups;34<P>* Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and<P>* Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.35<p>	When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:<p>* Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<P>
* See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<P>
* Have better health status than all other groups;
<P>
* Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
* Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
<P>

<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
<li>	Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<p>
<LI>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<P>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.36</ul><p>All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.37<p><b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b><p>	Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.38<P>	Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
	Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,39 many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
	In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.40  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.41<p>	Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.42<p> <b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b><p>	Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"43<P>	The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<P>
	Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #1:  Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</B>
<P>
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.44  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:<P><UL><LI>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.<p><LI>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<LI>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.45<p></ul>	Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act46 was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.47<P><B>BARRIER #2:  Misuse of the Foster Care System</B>
<P>
	In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<P><ol>
<li>Family preservation;<p>

<li>Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and<P>

<li>Long-term foster care or adoption.<p>
</ol><p>
	This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
	During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<P>
	Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.48  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.49<P>	A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal:  preventing the removal of children.50  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.51  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.52  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion:  children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<P>
	Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<P><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.53  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.</blockquote><p>		The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.<P>

	The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<P>
	Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.54  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #3:  Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</B>
<P>
	According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.55  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<P>
	The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<P>
	If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><UL>
<LI>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.<P>

<LI>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.<P>

<LI>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.<P>

<LI>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.<P>
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4:  Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<P>
	State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<P>
	In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<P>
	Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding56 in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.57  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.58Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.<P>	Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.59  If successful, the growing push for open adoption60 could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.61<P>	Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.62  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<P>
	Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.63<P>	Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #5:  Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>

<P>	Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,64 has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently65 that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. <P>	 A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in Lehr v. Robertson,66 is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.

<P>	The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #6:  Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<P>
	Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption:  against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<B>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</B>

<P>	There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.67  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.68  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.69  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.70<P>	The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<P>
	This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<P>
	Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.

<P>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<P>
	There is evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.71  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study72 put these comparable rates at:<P><UL><LI>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;<P><LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<P>
<LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.<P></ul>

Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:<P>

<LI>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;<P>

<LI>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and<P>

<LI>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.<P>

	These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.73<P>	To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<P><blockquote>
	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.74</blockquote><P>	To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.<P>	As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<P>
	In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.75  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.<P>	The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.76  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.77  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.<P>	Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.78<P>	The Institute for Justice recently filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.79  Similar racial discrim
ination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. <P>	 In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."80  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."81<P>	Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.82  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.<P>	The Bunning Amendment, now incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,83 despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.84<P>	Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive p
arents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.<P><B> NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</B><P>	A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<P>
	Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<P>
Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.85<P>	The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster and adopt. They show a double generosity.
<P>
	Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1.) Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</B>
<P>

	The House-passed tax bill (H.R. 1215) provides a non-refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for adoption costs for those with incomes up to $60,000, gradually phased out for those with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000.
<P>
	Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.86<P>	This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<P>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<P>
	The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<P>
	South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic:  the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.87  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<P>
	Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<P>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<P>
	To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<P><ul>
<LI>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,<P>

<LI>The rate of adoption,<P>

<LI>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,<P>

<LI>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and<P>

<LI>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).</ul><P>

	Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<P>
<B>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.</b>
<P>
	Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<P>
<B>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<P>
	One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<B>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</B>
<P>
	The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<P>
	Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<P>
	Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</B>
<P>
	While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<P>
	Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws.
<P>
<B>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </B>

<P>	This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<P>
	As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<P>
	If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<P>
<B>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</B>
<P>
	Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<P>
	To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children:  black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<P>
	One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.88  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.89<P>	Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<P>
	To encourage adoption, states should:
<P>
<B>1)   Privatize adoption services.</B>
<P>
	Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<P>
<B>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </B>
<P>
	Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<P>
<B>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </B>
<P>
	These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<P>
<B>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </B>
<P>
	This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<P>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </B>

<P>	While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children:  older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<P>
In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<P>
<B>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</B>
<P>
	Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, recently embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</B>
<P>
	When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<P>
<B>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</B>
<P>
	A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.90  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<P>
<B>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</B>

<P>	In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<P>
<B>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</B>
<P>
	Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<B>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</B>
<P>
	Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<P>
	Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses:  lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<P>
<B>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</B>
<P>
	If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<B>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</B>
<P>
	This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
	More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation:  the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<P>
	Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<P>
	Adoption works.
<P>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<P>
	The need is great and the solution is obvious:  adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies. Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings. The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates. Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population. This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment. Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis. The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<P>

<a href="tax_relf.gif">Table</a>: A Balanced Budget With Tax Relief Would Add $142 Billion to GDP...
<p>
Some policymakers maintain that tax relief is out of place in the quest for a balanced budget. They 
argue that tax cuts cannot be justified because they make the goal of a balanced budget even harder 
to reach.
<p>
But contrary to this view, the inclusion of tax cuts should be viewed as a critical component of any 
balanced budget plan. The reason is that reducing or eliminating tax relief on income from capital 
would lower potential economic growth significantly and would not in fact make room for new 
spending.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation recently used one of the principal econometric models of 
the U.S. economy to project the economic and fiscal effects of eliminating the tax relief elements of 
the congressional balanced budget act. This analysis shows:
<p><ul>
<li>The congressional balanced budget plan with tax cuts, as vetoed by President Clinton, would 
add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next seven years than the same 
congressional plan <i>without</i> tax cuts.
<p>
<li>The reductions in taxes on capital (including the capital gains tax relief) accounts for $66 
billion of this additional GDP and leads to a stronger economy in the long run.
</ul><p>
Heritage Foundation economists conducted this analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan 
using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. Laurence H. Meyer 
& Associates is a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in economic 
analysis.<sup>1 </sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, 
including the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National 
Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Home Builders.<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
The congressional tax relief plan includes a reduction of taxes on families and on capital. The lower 
taxes on family income include primarily the $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in the marriage 
penalty, and the adoption tax credit. The lower tax rates on income from capital include tax changes 
affecting capital gains, individual retirement accounts, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate 
and gift tax provisions.
<p>

<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Family Income</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on family income is the $500-per-child tax credit. The 
immediate benefit of the $500-per-child tax credit included in the congressional balanced budget is 
an increase in household disposable income. Although $500 may seem insignificant in light of the 
entire federal budget, it is a substantial benefit to individual families. As demonstrated by previous 
Heritage analysis, a family with a newborn baby could save the entire $500 each year for eighteen 
years and afford the tuition costs at an average public university.<sup>3 </sup>  Alternatively, an 
average family with two children could use the $1,000 credit to purchase one month's supply of 
food and mortgage.<sup>4 </sup>  This additional private sector savings and consumption made 
possible by the $500-per-child tax credit and other reductions in family income taxes will benefit 
the economy.
<p>
<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Capital</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on capital is the capital gains tax relief. Owners of 
appreciated assets sell those assets largely for one of two reasons: either to meet extraordinary 
expenses (educational, medical, or other large and non-recurring costs) or to move their money 
from an inferior to a superior investment. When government takes less of this income, household 
spending stimulates economic activity and more efficient investment fuels economic growth. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, the impact of a capital gains tax cut on investment and economic growth is more 
important in the long run than its role in allowing households to pay big bills. Two reasons for this 
relative importance stand out. First, reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of moving an 
investment from an average company to one that is exceptionally productive and well run. This 
lowering of the "switching" costs means that investors will play a larger role in promoting well run, 
productive companies. Thus, the economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower 
taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much 
interest on their capital loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when they made the capital 
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs usually mean more investment by businesses in labor-
saving equipment, which commonly results in increased labor productivity. This increased 
productivity gets translated into higher wages and, through the wonders of the division of labor, 
more jobs.
<p>
The following <a href="tax_relf.gif">table</a> compares the level of various economic indicators that result from the 
congressional balanced budget plan with tax relief and the congressional balanced budget plan 
without tax relief. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would be $13.7 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <i>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
<p>
<li>Real disposable income would be $23.1 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <I>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
</ul><p>
Removing capital gains tax relief from the congressional balanced budget will not allow increased 
federal spending. The capital gains tax relief element of the congressional balanced budget plan 
actually <i>reduces</i> the deficit in every year through 2002. There are two reasons for this. 
First, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate will produce more declarations of capital gains and 
thus increase government revenue from the capital gains tax. Second, the capital gains tax reduction 
creates a stronger economy, thus increasing the federal tax base. 
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps as high as $7.5 
trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>5</sup> Some economists have 
estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits 
and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. In an article last year for the 
<i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, two leading tax 
economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to 
rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital 
gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>6 </sup>  The federal government would collect tax 
revenues on these "windfall" capital gains that under the current tax rate would not have been 
declared.
<p>
The congressional tax relief proposal, including the capital gains tax reduction, would allow 
individuals and owners of capital to keep more of the money they otherwise would have paid in 
taxes. This additional private sector savings and spending would be allocated more efficiently than 
had the federal government spent the money and thus will lead to a stronger economy. A stronger 
economy, in turn, means a larger tax base from which the federal government can draw revenue.
<p>
The important complement to this analysis is that, contrary to popular belief, additional spending 
opportunities for the federal government would not be available if the capital gains tax relief 
element of the congressional balanced budget plan is eliminated. In fact, additional spending 
reductions would be necessary in the future to offset the potential revenue foregone by elimination 
of the capital gains tax reduction.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only 
those elements of the Laurence H. Meyer & Associates baseline forecast that deal with federal 
spending and federal tax policy. 
<p>
The analysis is based on spending reductions specified in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, passed 
by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton on December 6. For specific assumptions concerning 
these spending reductions see, William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What 
a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,"</a> Heritage Foundation 
F.Y.I. No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
The major components of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for in the following 
manner:
<p><ul>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of individual capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 
2004. The maximum corporate capital gains tax rate was reduced from 35 percent to 28 percent.
<p>
<li>The average effective tax rate on individuals was reduced according to the annual value of the 
$500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
<li>Other provisions of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for by changing the 
effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.
</ul><p>
The analysis in this paper is based on the November economic forecast and projection of Laurence 
H. Meyer & Associates. This is the most recent economic forecast available from Laurence H. 
Meyer & Associates.
<p>
Note: Reduction in tax on income includes: family tax relief, the reduction in the marriage penalty; 
and the adoption tax credit. Reduction in tax on capital includes: tax changes affecting capital gains, 
IRAs, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate and gift tax provisions.

HOW A CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BOOST STATE REVENUES</h3>

<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The vetoed congressional budget plan would significantly cut effective taxes on capital gains, both 
for individuals and for businesses. The Heritage Foundation estimates that this important tax cut 
could cause millions of taxpayers to declare billions of dollars in capital gains during the first year 
of the lower effective rates. Because 40 states require taxpayers to report all capital gains declared 
on their federal tax forms, this sudden growth in capital gains may create a one-year state income 
tax windfall of $9.5 billion.
<P>
If taxpayers were to "unlock" appreciated assets during the first year of lower capital gains taxes 
under the congressional budget plan, states that tax capital gains would likely see their income tax 
revenues increase by an average of 11.6 percent.
<p>
Some states might experience an especially high one-time percentage increase in their income tax 
receipts. For example:
<p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The reason for this state tax "windfall" actually is quite simple. Reducing the tax rate for capital 
gains actually increases tax revenues from taxpayers who own appreciated assets. Experience over 
the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases 
produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated 
assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to or "lock up" their assets in anticipation of lower 
future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains declarations goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized or "locked up" capital gains (perhaps has 
high as $7.5 trillion) exists in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>1 </sup>  Some 
economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial 
economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments.<sup>2 </sup> In 
an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William 
Randolph, two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated 
the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being in the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one 
percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations rose by 6 percent.<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
The accompanying table shows three different state "windfall" scenarios, representing the range of 
expert opinion on how declarations are affected by a change in the rate. Each scenario uses the 
actual capital gains declarations by individuals as reported in the IRS's Public Use File for 
1991.<sup>4 </sup> The first set of columns shows the low estimate, which is calculated by 
multiplying the drop in the effective tax rate by 0.17. This means a 50 percent decrease in the 
effective capital gains tax rate results in a 51 percent increase in capital gains declarations. The third 
set of columns shows the high estimate, which multiplies the 50 percent decrease by the "transitory 
tax elasticity" estimated by Burman and Randolph: 6.42. While Burman and Randolph offer solid 
evidence for this strong level of taxpayer response to a change in the capital gains tax rate (which in 
the table leads to a 321 percent increase in declarations), it is probably imprudent for states to 
budget on this optimistic outcome. Thus, the second set of columns shows the midpoint between 
the low and high responses. The midpoint estimates reflect an increase in declarations of 156 
percent for a 50 percent drop in the tax rate.
<p>
As always, the difficult part of estimating tax revenues from capital gains is forecasting the value of 
the appreciated assets taxpayers will liquidate and the time of their liquidation. No particularly good 
and reliable revenue model exists for this purpose. Thus tax analysts are left with calculating 
historical responses to tax changes and assuming that the future will be very much like the past. 
<p>
Thus, these Heritage "mid-point" estimates, based as they are on data from a slow economic year 
and a mid-range level of taxpayer response, should give state revenue officers a reasonable number 
for incorporating into their state income tax forecasts. These middle estimates also illustrate 
conservatively that what happens to capital gains at the federal level has important implications for 
the revenues of 40 states. Besides the good economic effects on state economies resulting from a 
balanced budget with tax cuts, the congressional budget plan actually supplies the states with 
additional revenue that they can use to meet their additional responsibilities. If, on the other hand, 
the capital gains cut were to be pared back or eliminated in the negotiations over a budget, that 
would reduce or eliminate the revenue benefit to states with a capital gains tax.

information extracted from actual tax returns. The Public Use File for 1992 was not available at the 
time Heritage performed this analysis. Thus, Heritage is using the most recent, detailed tax data 
supplied to the general public by the IRS.

CLINTON'S $300-PER-CHILD TAX CUT PLAN
DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h3>

<hr width=50%><br>

<bq><i> Now, what the Congress wants to do is to roll back that working family's [Earned Income Tax Credit], in a way that will impose a tax increase averaging $500 a family on families least able to pay it.  This is a tax hike that literally will push many working families back into poverty.<br>
 President Bill Clinton, October 7, 1995</i></bq></center>

<P>
	The White House charged in October that Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would raise taxes on families earning below $30,000, because of the proposed congressional reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Yet a comparison of President Clinton's just-released budget (with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000<sup>1</sup>) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by Clinton on Wednesday (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children in families earning up to $110,000<sup>2</sup>) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with children than the Clinton plan. This is so even after accounting for the changes in the EITC in the Balanced Budget Act. The group especially hit under the Clinton budget are many families with children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the $300 child credit under the Clinton plan (receiving only the EITC) and who would be eligible for both the $500 child credit and the EITC under the congressional plan.
<p>
	Overall, the $500-per-child tax credit in Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would benefit 23 million more children than the Administration's $300-per-child credit. Congress's plan would give tax relief to 10.4 million families with children who would receive no tax relief under the Clinton plan. In addition, there would be millions of families in which at least one sibling would receive tax relief under Clinton but other siblings would not. Taken together, the total number of children not qualifying for any tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under Congress's plan. These children would receive $15.4 billion in tax relief under Congress's plan but nothing under Clinton's plan.
<p>
	There are three major reasons why the Clinton tax cut plan ends up denying tax relief to so many families with children:


<p>
<b>Reason #1: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families with children under age 13.</b>  Since roughly 25 percent of all children are over age 12, millions of families are denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising that child becomes more expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to the families of at least 2.8 million children earning under $30,000 per year. This restriction also reduces the average tax cut per family because many families have children below age 13 and children age 13 or older. Indeed, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton plan is $442, but the average tax cut under Congress's plan is $856 per family.
<p>
<b>Reason #2: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families earning up to $75,000 per year.</b> While some 88 percent of all children live in families earning below $75,000 per year, this income restriction denies $2.6 billion in tax relief to nearly 6 million families with children, compared with Congress's plan. Many of these families would by no means consider themselves "rich." For example, a federal worker earning $40,000 per year and his school teacher spouse earning $35,000 could easily find themselves denied tax relief under the Clinton plan.  
<p>
<b>Reason #3: The Clinton plan requires low-income families to deduct their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before they can take the $300-per-child tax credit.</b> By contrast, Congress's plan allows a low-income family to take the $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the full measure of the EITC on top of the child credit. As the following table shows, as a result of this difference in which the tax credit is taken versus the EITC, a family with two children would have to earn $24,000 annually before becoming eligible for the Clinton credit. By contrast, under the Balanced Budget Act this family would become eligible for the credit at roughly $17,000 in annual income.
<p><bq>




<b>Example:</b> Say a married couple with two children earning $23,000 per year pays $908 in income taxes. To calculate how much of a tax cut they would receive under the Clinton plan, this family must first deduct roughly $1,170 in EITC benefits from their $908 income tax bill, which results in zero available income taxes from which to deduct the $600 tax credit they might otherwise be eligible to receive. However, under Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan, this family would first take a tax deduction of $908 (although their two children would otherwise give them $1,000 tax credit, the value of the tax deduction cannot exceed their income tax liability). Then they would receive, in addition, their full $1,170 in EITC benefits ($1,514 after the congressional reforms).
</bq><p>
See Chart 1: <a href="fyi78_2.gif">Tax Savings: Married Couple with Two Children</a>
<p> 
	Combined, these three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially inferior to Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering the reforms in the EITC. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit plan would benefit 23 million fewer children, than Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan. Some 10.4 million families would get no tax relief under Clinton but would under Congress's plan. Millions of other families would receive reduced tax relief because some of their children would qualify under Congress's plan but not under Clinton's. Taken together, these families would be denied $15 billion per year in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Compared with Congress's $500-per-child tax cut plan, the Clinton plan would deny tax relief to 5.4 million children in families earning below $30,000 per year in income. Under Congress's plan, these same families would receive $2.3 billion in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a single parent with one child would have to earn over $18,500 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this parent would begin getting tax relief with just over $11,500 in annual income. See Chart 2: <a href="fyi78_3.gif">Tax Savings: Single Parent with One Child</a>.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a married couple with two children would have to make $24,000 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this family would begin getting tax relief at $17,000 in annual income.
See Table 1: <a href="fyi78_1.gif">Income at Which Family Becomes Eligible for Tax Cut</a><p></ul><p>
Even after accounting for reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit, families with two children earning below $30,000 per year would, on average, receive $132 more each year in tax cuts than under the Clinton plan. Single parents with one child earning below $30,000 annually would receive $187 more tax relief on average than under the Clinton plan. Even this assumes that both of these families have children under age 13 (and thus eligible for the Clinton credit). Since 25 percent of all children are above the age of 12, many of these families would receive far less tax relief on average under the Clinton plan. Congress's plan gives an average of $856 in tax relief per family, whereas the Clinton plan gives an average of $442 per family.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The Administration's $300 per-child credit begins phasing out for families with incomes above $60,000 and reaches zero at $75,000 in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per child after 1998.

<li>For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income.

<bq><i>
"If you take the $500 a year tax credit, and I figure, you know,
$5 for a bottle of wine, that is 100 bottles of wine for a family...."<sup>1</sup></i><br> Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA)<br></center></bq><p>	Contrary to what elitists in Washington would have the public believe, for most hard-working American families raising children a $500 tax cut for each child is not an insignificant amount of money. This is especially true as many families no doubt are wondering how they will be able to afford the $432 some surveys report each household expects to spend this holiday season.<sup>2</sup> Yet the families of 51 million children, or over 28 million families in all, were denied relief from their financial worries when President Bill Clinton recently vetoed Congress's seven year balanced budget and tax cut plan, which had as its centerpiece a $500-per-child tax credit. This tax cut would pump over $22 billion per year into family budgets across the country so that working parents can provide for their children in a way no government program can.
<p>
	As congressional Republicans negotiate with the White House on a compromise plan to balance the budget by 2002 and provide tax cuts, they should resist pressure to scale back the $500-per-child tax credit as a price for cutting a deal. Those who argue that Washington cannot "afford" such generous tax cuts while the government is trying to balance the budget are, in effect, arguing for higher spending. The budget will not be balanced any faster if the amount of the per-child credit is reduced below $500 or if the income for which families are eligible is lowered from its current level of $110,000 for joint filers.<sup>3</sup> Any money not put back in the checkbooks of working families with children through tax cuts, is more money in the checkbook for politicians and bureaucrats to spend while the budget is moving toward balance.
<p>
	Congressional and White House negotiators should keep in mind that for parents with two children, the $1,000 tax cut they would receive under this plan could mean the difference between paying the mortgage and not. Indeed, as the table below shows, a $1,000 tax cut for the typical family with two children is enough to pay one month's mortgage and grocery bills, or 11 months worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months worth of clothing for the children. In other words, a $1,000 tax cut is a significant amount of money for most families' household budgets. 

<p>
	There are also sound policy reasons to cut taxes for families with children:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Families with children are overtaxed.</b> In 1948, the average American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent.
<p>
<li><b>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.</b> The average family now loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the congressional tax-cut plan would give to a family with two children would help this family pay one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
<li><b>Millions of families stand to benefit.</b> The families of 51 million American children, or 28 million taxpaying families, are eligible for the $500-per-child tax cut. 
<p>
<li><b>Family tax relief helps families in every state. </b>The typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 tax credit. Thus families in the typical district would receive $54 million per year in tax relief.
<p>
<li><b>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7 million children.</b> These 3.5 million families will receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax burden eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three children earning up to $26,000 also would have their income tax bill eliminated.
<p>
<li><b>Most families are middle-class.</b> The $500 child credit plan will direct 89 percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 per year --  middle-income by any standard --  and over 96 percent to families with incomes below $100,000.
<p>
<li><b>Cutting taxes for all families --  regardless of income --  is fair.</b> Congress's plan will cut    the income tax burden of a family of four earning $30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.


</ul><P>
















<center><b>TECHNICAL NOTES ON TABLES</b></center>
<P>
	The following tables represent the best available means of estimating the amount of family tax relief that will go to each state and congressional district from a $500-per-child tax credit. It should be noted that not every eligible family will be able to subtract the full $500 for each child from its tax bill. We have tried to take the following exceptions into account:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The $500 credit is non-refundable.</b>This means that a family cannot get more in tax relief than it pays in income taxes. Example: a family of four earning $20,000 per year owes about $458 in income taxes. Though the $500-per-child tax credit might otherwise get them $1,000 in total tax relief because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe  $458  from their income tax bill.

<li><b>The $500 credit is phased out for joint filers with incomes above $110,000 per year and single filers with incomes above $75,000 per year.</b> For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income and is fully phased out at $95,000 in income.
</ul><p>
	The first two tables, showing the number of households and children by state, were calculated using the 1991 IRS Public Use File.  This data is derived from income tax return forms and the number of dependents claimed on those forms.
<P>
	The tables listing family tax relief by congressional district were calculated using the 1990 Census.
<p>
	Because the sources for the two tables are different, the tax relief calculated for each state will not necessarily equal the sum of tax relief for that state's individual counties. In each case, the source is the most accurate data available for that specific level of analysis.  The differences may be caused by the following facts:
<p><ol>
<li>The IRS data are based on tax returns filed with the federal government.  Not every household files a tax return, however.  For some groups this is by law; Native Americans are not required to file a tax return.  Other individuals do not file because they do not have an income to report.  Finally, some people simply do not file for personal reasons.  These same groups may be counted by the Census Bureau but will not be accounted for by the IRS.

<li>Many people maintain a permanent residence in one county or state but live in another.  These people pay taxes in a different county or state  than where they live.  Again the Census and IRS will account for these people in different locations.

<li>Many people file their tax returns late.  Thus, the data from the 1991 IRS files may not include certain families that would be included in the Census count. Alternatively, the IRS records may include more families (because of people filing from past years) than the Census Bureau count

<p>
Congress's plan to balance the budget over seven years with tax cuts, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would significantly improve the housing of many renters and homeowners while lowering their housing costs. According to an econometric analysis by The Heritage Foundation, adopting the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to:
<p><ul>
<li>104,000 additional housing starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002;
<p>
<li>New or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans;
<p>
<li>A drop in mortgage interest rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about $10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage purchased under current budget and tax law; and
<p>
<li>A 4 percent drop in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases in the cost of capital and lower interest rates), with the value of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the growing demand for new homes.
</ul><p>
This good news on housing reflects the stronger economy that economists at The Heritage Foundation predict would result from the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<sup>1</sup>  Incomes and output would rise, inflation and interest rates would fall, and the spending and tax cuts proposed by Congress would lead to significant growth in productivity and investment. Each has a positive effect on housing. Specifically, the boost in new home construction would produce widespread benefits, and the tax policy provisions of the Act would lead simultaneously to lower housing costs.
<p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> conducted this analysis of the congressional budget plan using an economic model of the U.S. economy developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economics consulting firm whose model is used routinely by major private firms and by such public agencies as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Congressional Budget Office.
<p>

<b>Growth in New Home Construction</b>
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a>
<p>
The healthier economy that flows from Congress's tax and spending cuts produces two important effects on family housing.
<p>
First, the tax reductions, particularly the cuts in capital gains taxes, would jump start a boom in new investments by households and businesses.<sup>2</sup>  The Meyer model indicates that investors would pour an additional $11 billion (adjusted for inflation) into the housing sector as a result of the congressional budget plan. Without the tax and spending cuts, these new investments in family housing likely would not be made.<p>Home builders would use these new funds to construct an estimated 51,200 new single-family homes and 52,800 new multi-family dwellings over the seven-year period from 1996 through 2002.
<p>
This construction activity would mean employment and income growth in the housing industry, in the banking and real estate sectors, and in thousands of other companies that sell new homeowners everything from telephones to tabletops.
<p>
Second, these new investment dollars would provide improved housing for nearly 700,000 families. The model projects 7,200 starts of 2-to-4-unit dwellings and 45,600 starts of 5-or-more-unit dwellings. Assuming that all dwellings in the 2-to-4 category are actually 2-unit dwellings and all in the 5-or-more category are only 5-unit buildings, then the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 could provide new apartments for 288,000 families. Add to this number the 51,200 families who would be moving into single-family housing, and it becomes apparent that Congress's budget plan will significantly improve the housing of many Americans. Specifically: 
<p><ul>
<li>An additional 339,200 families could move into new housing over the next seven years as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Assuming a national average family size of 2.63, this means 892,100 people could enjoy new housing over this period.<sup>3</sup><P><li>Assuming that the 339,200 dwellings vacated by these families who are moving up in housing are purchased or rented by another 339,200 families looking to improve their own housing, the total number of people affected by these new housing starts could be 1,784,200.</ul><p>
<b>Reduced Housing Costs</b>
<p>
While the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would contribute significantly to the welfare of Americans through its salutary influence on housing, the legislation's benefits for homeowners and renters would not end there. The Act's role in stimulating the growth of investment and reducing the after-tax cost of capital (largely through reductions in the effective tax rate on capital gains) reduces the cost of housing. The Meyer model projects that the cost of housing will be 4 percent lower by 2002 than it otherwise would be under current law. Two factors explain this drop in the relative price of housing.
<p>
First, Congress's budget plan would reduce the costs of capital directly by reducing the effective tax rate on capital gains. For example, if Jones is thinking about cashing out an appreciated asset (say, a company stock) and loaning the proceeds to Smith, who is building an apartment building, Jones will consider the taxes he or she must pay on the capital gain as an important part of making the loan. If Jones paid a high capital gain tax, then he or she will demand a higher rate of return on the investment. Thus, dropping the effective tax rate on capital gains works to lower the cost of capital for those who borrow. The Meyer model predicts that the after-tax cost of capital by 2002 would be a full percentage point lower than it would be under current law.
<p>
Because capital costs are an important part of the costs landlords must cover by the rents they receive, one highly possible outcome of tax cuts is lower than expected rental payments by families in apartments or single-family rental property.
<p>
Similarly, the prices of new single-family homes will rise less rapidly in a world with tax cuts than in a world without them for the very same reason:  Homebuilders will be paying less for the capital they need for home construction.
<p>
Second, the relative price of housing would drop under the vetoed plan because mortgages would be less costly. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 not only would cut the effective rate on capital gains, but also would permit middle and lower income families with children to keep $23 billion more of their income each year through the child tax credit. The Meyer model indicates that families would use a portion of this money to buy stocks and bonds and to increase their personal savings accounts. These actions would increase the supply of funds available for investment. Thus, the mortgage interest rate (like all of the major interest rates in the Meyer model) would fall because the after-tax cost of capital would decline and the supply of investment dollars rise.
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>
<p>
The 0.4 percent drop in the mortgage interest rate from what it otherwise would be means that a $100,000 home loan would cost about $10,000 less in today's dollars over a typical 30-year loan repayment period.
<p>
Lower borrowing costs would allow more families to enter the housing market, which would contribute to price stability in housing and the preservation of household net wealth.
<p>
This important role of lower interest rates -- preserving the value of all homes through the competitive price bidding of home buyers -- explains in part the impressive growth in household net worth by 2002:  The Meyer model projects that, at the end of the seven-year balancing period, households will be worth nearly $200 billion more than they otherwise would have been under current law. 
<p>
It is benefits of this magnitude that President Clinton has foregone through his veto. Not only does the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 inadvertently create a "housing program" of significant proportions; it also contributes to a general improvement in family financial well-being.

<h3><I>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #6:
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES</i></h3>

<hr width=-50%></center><p>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax relief, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would expand the purchasing power of today's seniors and allow younger Americans to save more money for their retirement. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy.<sup>1</sup>  According to this statistical analysis, the congressional plan would mean:<p><b>For Current Retirees</b><p>A retiree showing $2,150 in capital gains for 1995 would realize $245 in additional after-tax income from a reduction in the capital gains tax.<p>A senior citizen with only $25,000 per year in nominal dollars for retirement could see an increase of $1,125 in real purchasing power over the next ten years due to decreased inflation.<p><b>For Future Retirees</b>
<p>
A worker saving $500 annually before taxes in the proposed "super IRA" for 40 years would realize an additional $3,070 in today's dollars compared with putting the same amount in a conventional IRA.
<p>
A 25-year-old couple raising one newborn child could save $41,150 in today's dollars for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit.
<p>
A young couple buying a home with a $100,000 mortgage could save $33,890 in today's dollars for their retirement from decreased monthly mortgage payments.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates,<sup>2</sup> a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>3</sup><p>The positive benefits to current and future retirees from the congressional balanced budget plan are discussed below. These include increased after-tax income from lower capital gains tax rates; expanded purchasing power from lower inflation; and increased potential retirement income from super IRAs, the $500-per-child tax credit, and lower mortgage rates.<p><b>Benefits to Current Retirees</b><p>Increased After-Tax Income from Lower Capital Gains Taxes. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 lowers the effective tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction of half the net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on capital gains drop to 14 percent.<sup>4</sup>  Contrary to popular belief, the capital gains tax reduction is not a tax break enjoyed primarily by the rich. The typical household declaring a capital gain in 1991 had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729.<sup>5</sup>  For seniors claiming a capital gain in 1991, the average income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> was $43,637, with an average gain of $2,151.<p>A reduction in the capital gains tax is particularly important for today's retirees who have invested in capital assets as a means of saving for their retirement. There are two major reasons why the capital gains tax cut is so important to seniors:<p><ul><li>Senior citizens claim a disproportionate amount of capital gains. Households containing taxpayers 
who are over the age of 65 or blind constituted only 3.5 percent of all returns in 1991 but accounted for more than 27 percent of taxpaying households declaring capital gains. 
<p>
<li>Current law imposes a surtax on Social Security benefits. For example, a retiree facing a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent also must pay a surtax of 7.5 percent. This is why many individuals face higher marginal tax rates during their retirement than over the rest of their lifetime.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, the 50 percent exclusion may be more valuable during a taxpayer's retirement years than during his working years.
</ul><p>
To understand the benefits of the capital gains exclusion for seniors, consider a newly retired couple realizing $2,150 in capital gains during 1995. If this couple faces the lowest marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the Social Security surtax of 7.5 percent, they will receive only $1,665 in after-tax income from these gains. Under the congressional balanced budget plan, however, this same retired couple would realize $1,910, an increase of $245 over current law.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $245 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>One month of groceries for the average retired household, or
<p>
<li>Six months of housekeeping supplies for the average retired household.
</ul><p>
<b>Increased Purchasing Power from Lower Inflation.</b> Many senior citizens have saved a fixed amount of money for their retirement years. Seniors living on a fixed income are affected directly by inflation because it changes the purchasing power of their money. As inflation increases the prices of goods, consumers are able to purchase less:  Inflation eats away at purchasing power. Because retirees, as a rule, are more likely to be restricted to a fixed income, they will benefit disproportionately from a slower rate of inflation.
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that prices likely will increase more slowly in the future because of a more efficient economy spurred by a balanced federal budget and tax relief. By 2002, inflation rates are projected by this analysis to be 0.7 percent below what is expected under current law. This means consumers will be able to purchase more goods with the same amount of money. For example, a retired household living on a fixed income of $25,000 per year will see their purchasing power increase by $1,125 in today's dollars over the course of the next ten years.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $1,125 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on laundry and household cleaning over the next ten years,
<p>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on fresh milk and cream over the next ten years, or
<p>
<li>One-half the amount an average retired household will spend on furniture over the next ten years.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>Benefits to Future Retirees</b><p><b>Benefits from Super IRAs.</b> Current laws allow tax-free deposits of up to $2,000 per year in contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). However, withdrawals from these IRAs made during retirement years are taxable. The tax provisions of the congressional balanced budget plan would create a new kind of IRA, known as a super IRA. Contributions to a super IRA would be taxable; however, withdrawals could be made tax-free. As Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, notes, "If the tax rate is the same at the time of deposit and the time of withdrawal, taxpayers would be indifferent between the two types of IRAs. However, most middle-income workers will face higher tax rates during the years of their retirement, because of the Social Security benefits tax."<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, retired workers will not face the higher tax rates associated with retirement when making withdrawals from super IRAs.<p>The <a href="fyi_79.gif">table</a> below shows the advantage of the congressional super-IRA provision. Suppose a young worker decides to invest $500 annually in a conventional IRA. Because these annual contributions are tax-exempt under current law, this worker can dedicate the entire $500 in personal savings. After 40 years of $500 annual contributions, this worker's IRA will have accumulated $129,528 in future dollars. However, under current law, this worker must pay taxes on withdrawals from the IRA. If this now-retired worker faces a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the surtax of 7.5 percent, he will pay 22.5 percent of the accumulated $129,528 in taxes, leaving him with an after-tax income of $100,384 in future dollars.
<p>
Now suppose this same worker was able to invest the $500 per year in a super IRA. This worker, facing a marginal tax rate of 15 percent, would be able to dedicate only $425 to the IRA because contributions to super IRAs are not tax-free. Every year he would pay $75 in taxes and deposit $425 in the super IRA. After 40 years of $425 annual contributions, this worker's super IRA will have accumulated $110,099. However, this entire amount can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, by investing in a super IRA he will have $9,715 more after 40 years in after-tax income for his retirement years. This additional future income is equal to $3,070 in today's dollars.
<p>
<b>Extra Potential Retirement Savings from $500-per-Child Tax Credit.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit 28 million families raising some 51 million children. A 25-year-old couple that has just had a child and decides to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit every year for 18 years to savings for their retirement, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional 22 years, could accumulate $41,150 in today's dollars ($101,820 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>9</sup><p>This additional savings amounts to:<p><ul><li>The total amount an average retired couple will spend on groceries over ten years of retirement, or<li>The total amount an average retired homeowner will spend on mortgage payments, property taxes, and home maintenance costs over ten years of retirement.<sup>10</sup></ul><p><b>Extra Potential Retirement Income from Lower Home-Mortgage Rates.</b> The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates as a result of a stronger economy spurred by a balanced budget and tax relief. Specifically, the simulation projects mortgage interest rates in 2002 will be 0.4 percent below what they are expected to be under current law. This 0.4 percentage point decrease below baseline means that a new home borrower of $100,000 will save $25 per month in mortgage payments.
<p>
A homeowner who chooses to dedicate the extra $25 per month to retirement savings for every month over the 30-year life of the mortgage, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional ten years, will accumulate $33,890 in today's dollars ($80,440 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>11</sup> <p>This additional savings amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The total amount an average senior citizen will spend on utility payments over 15 years of retirement,
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on dining away from home over 20 years of retirement, or
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on gasoline and motor oil over ten years of retirement plus a modest vacation every year for ten years.<sup>12</sup></ul><p><b>Technical Assumptions</b><p>For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy</a>," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For calculations of accumulated savings from the $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the entire $500 was contributed to a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 22 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
The 0.4 percent decline in mortgage interest rates was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation. It was assumed that the savings from this decline were placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Contributions to the IRA were made over the life of a 30-year mortgage. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 10 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
Middle-income seniors typically face a higher tax rate because of the Social Security surtax on "provisional income."<sup>13</sup>  The effect of this surtax is to place America's middle-income elderly in a special, higher bracket by virtue of their age. For instance, if an individual younger than the retirement age receives $1 from savings, the income tax will take 15 cents in the lowest tax bracket. But some Americans must also pay the Social Security surtax, and a second 7.5 cents on the same $1 of savings could be due under the surtax.

<a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment From A Balanced Budget<br><p>


Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead over the next seven years to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law. The following are the findings of an analysis by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. According to the model, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:
<p><ul>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002. 
<p>
<li>An additional 103,700 housing starts over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p></ul>
The analysis is important because many critics of the budget plan have expressed the concern that slowing the growth of federal spending to balance the budget in seven years will cause an economic downturn, if not a recession. Many supporters of the plan, on the other hand, claim that a balanced budget will reduce interest rates and spur productive, private-sector investment and economic activity. The Heritage analysis indicates the supporters are correct.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the plan using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. The analysis is based on the Congressional Budget Resolution, as passed by Congress in May, which forms the overall structure of budget legislation now moving through Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee's description of tax policy changes.1  The Meyer model was used to gauge the general effects that key components of the budget would have on the economy. The Heritage Foundation's simulation of the budget plan strongly indicates that the general trend of economic activity will improve significantly during the "glide path" to a balanced budget as compared with a baseline of continued deficits under current law.
<p>
Laurence H. Meyer & Associates is a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms. Among them:  the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Ford Motor Company.2 
<p>

<b>The Baseline Projection</b>
<p>
Heritage used projections of economic activity under current budget and tax policy prepared by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates as the economic baseline against which the Congress's budget and tax plan is compared. This baseline forecast (dated August 1995) projects that under current law the federal deficit continuously worsens during the projection period, from a fiscal year 1995 level of $162.1 billion to a fiscal year 2002 level of $257.4 billion. According to the baseline forecast and projection, the average annual growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product associated with these continuing deficits is 2.48 percent.3

To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only those elements of the Meyer baseline that deal with federal spending and federal tax policy. The spending levels embodied in the Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution were introduced into the model in such a way that the resulting simulation mirrored the priorities defined in the resolution. For instance, the growth rates for both Medicare transfers and Medicaid grants were limited to levels called for within the budget resolution. Similarly, welfare spending was limited to a growth rate of 3.5 percent per year after 1997. Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs. And spending decreases in government purchases and transfer payments were assumed until a balanced budget was reached in 2002.4
<p>
With respect to changes in tax policy, the model was adjusted to reflect the new average tax rates that individuals and businesses would face if Congress enacted the changes in tax deductions and allowances defined by the Senate Finance Committee in the Chairman's Mark of October 16, 1995. Heritage calculated the changes in average effective federal tax rates that would result from adoption of family tax relief and various changes in the tax treatment of IRAs, health care costs, and estate taxes. These tax policy changes were used to adjust the model's average rate for individuals. Also incorporated were proposed changes in the taxation of individual and corporate capital gains, principally the exclusion of 50 percent of capital gains for individuals, the capping of the corporate tax rate on capital gains at 28 percent, and other major tax policy changes in the Chairman's Mark that would affect businesses.5
<p>
<a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates how balancing the federal budget in seven years while cutting taxes would affect the U.S. economy. Critics of balancing the budget and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession. As <a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, the simulation not only results in no such recession, but indicates that the economy would generally grow slightly faster with the proposed budget and tax changes than without them. Over the seven-year forecast horizon, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grows by $10.8 billion more with these public policy changes than without them, and at no time during this period does the economy become recessionary (see <a href="fyi69c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).
<p>
There appear to be three principal forces behind this growth in economic activity.
<p>
<b>First, the tax cuts add $32.1 billion above baseline to real household disposable income during the period 1995-2002. </b>
<p>
This growth in the real purchasing power of average Americans explains the higher levels of consumption expenditures under the policy of a balanced budget with tax cuts than under the baseline of continuing deficits and high taxes.
<p>
Total real consumption expenditures are above baseline every year after 1996.
<p>
<b>Second, balancing the budget and cutting taxes leads to greater investment in plant and equipment that, in turn, leads to higher levels of productivity (see <a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). </b>
<p>
The simulation indicates that households and businesses will face lower interest rates under the balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy.
<p>
For example, the federal funds rate would fall from 5.8 percent in 1995 to 4.1 percent by 2002 in the simulation, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than the baseline. 
<p>
10-year and 30-year government notes would have significantly lower yields by 2002 than in the baseline of continued deficits. 
<p>
The contract rate for first-time mortgages would drop faster under a balanced budget with tax cuts than in the baseline, to 6.1 percent in 2002 rather than 6.5 percent. This means that the budget and tax plan will save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<p>
All of these downward interest rate movements when combined with lower taxes support higher growth in household and business purchases of durable goods, homes, and factories.
<p>
Total housing starts would be 2.1 percent higher than in the baseline by 2002, according to the simulation.
<p>
Investment in business machinery would be 2.7 percent higher than in the baseline, with the computers component of business durable equipment outgrowing the baseline by 2.3 percent and all other equipment purchases ending 2.9 percent higher in 2002 than in the baseline.
<p>
The increase in capital investment denotes a movement in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets. In other words, households and businesses are increasing their purchases of more productive and longer-term investments. These investments would have several positive effects. In particular: 
<p>
Real compensation per hour for workers would increase faster (and be the same or higher in every year) than the baseline, and industrial production for businesses would be higher. 
<p>
The simulation shows slightly slower growth in GDP than the baseline in 1996. This temporary slower growth is due to reduced federal government purchases. However, the shift in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets generally supports greater economic growth after 1996. The continued purchases of durable goods and equipment by households and businesses more than offsets reductions in government spending.
<p>
<b>Third, the reduction of federal government spending in the private economy leads not only to a stronger macroeconomy, but to one with less inflation.</b>
<p>
Both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index would grow more slowly with a balanced budget plan and tax cuts than without them. For example:
<p>
The average growth in the CPI, according to the simulation, would be 1.94 percent per year, while the baseline forecast projects an annual average growth rate of 2.29 percent. 
<p>
It should be noted that the simulation also shows a slightly higher unemployment rate than the baseline in each year after 1995. This slight growth in projected unemployment stems from two factors, one of them a normal feature of economic change and the other based on an assumption about monetary policy.
<p>
First, the reduction in government spending would mean layoffs in the public sector and in firms supplying goods and services to the government. Second, the simulation performed by Heritage assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means relatively lower levels of growth in consumption expenditures and employment when compared with a simulation, also performed by Heritage and using the Meyer model, that assumes the Federal Reserve reacts to the slowdown in government spending by easing constraints on banks. It is worth noting that this second simulation (where the Fed stimulates short-term economic activity by expanding the supplies of money and credit) yields unemployment rates that are the same or better than the baseline. The unemployment numbers shown are a worst-case scenario when compared to model simulations which assume a reaction by the central bank.
<p>
This interim analysis of Congress's budget and tax plan may surprise both its supporters and its critics. On the one hand, supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately than the analysis shows. But the plan's supporters should take note that, while these changes over the seven-year forecast period are significant, the major impact of these policy changes occurs not immediately, but steadily -- over the period in which the budget is balanced and thereafter. Further, the tax changes, while significant, are only a small adjustment in today's code. Congress would need to enact major reforms of the code to spur the level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict. If Congress were to make pro-growth reforms in federal tax policy (such as enacting a flat tax), the future pattern of the economy likely would improve much more than it would as the result of the relatively modest tax changes now being considered. 
<p>
Critics of the balanced budget plan, on the other hand, should recognize that the plan generally supports their objective of economic growth at lower interest rates and lower inflation.
<p>
<b>Technical Notes</b>
<p>
The following policy assumptions were accounted for:
<ul><p>
<li>Military spending--90% of the spending increases over the next seven years was applied to the procurement account. The other 10% was applied to Department of Defense civilian employment increases. Zero percent real growth was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Agriculture--The $13.4 billion savings from decreased agriculture subsidies called for in the budget resolution was spread over seven years in the following distribution:  1996 ($0.6), 1997 ($1), 1998 ($1.6), 1999 and 2000 ($2), 2001 ($2.6), 2002 ($3.6). A reduction of $3.6 billion was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Medicare--Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare follow those in the budget resolution. A growth rate of 7.63 percent was assumed for 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Welfare--Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<p>
<li>Foreign aid--Transfer payments to foreigners were decreased according to the reductions called for in the budget resolution for account number 150 (international affairs).
<p>
<li>Medicaid--The growth rate in Medicaid was held to the levels called for in the budget reconciliation:  7.2 percent in 1996, 6.8 in 1997, and 4 percent thereafter.
<p>
<li>Civilian and military compensation per person was held constant after 1998.
<p>
<li>Non-defense federal civilian employment was decreased by 20 percent, spread evenly between 1996 and 2000. 
<p>
<li>All other spending-- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>Capital gains taxes--A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief--Federal receipts from individual income taxes were reduced according to the yearly levels in the Joint Tax Committee's score of the Senate's tax package.
</ul><p>
Other provisions of the Senate tax relief package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<title>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #2:
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAXES?</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 76<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 contains important changes in capital gains tax policy. Specifically, the bill lowers the effective tax rate by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction for half of net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on gains drop to 14 percent. For corporations, the bill decreases the capital gains tax rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent. Both changes are effective after December 31, 1994.<sup>1</sup><p>Proponents of these tax policy changes argue that lower capital gains tax rates will stimulate economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code, and increase federal revenue from the capital gains tax by encouraging individuals to "unlock" gains that they have been unwilling to realize at the currently high tax rate. Critics of these changes argue that lower effective tax rates on capital gains disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans, thus rendering the federal tax system more unfair. The critics also suggest that the "economic stimulus" produced by the reduction in rates will improve principally the fortunes of the owners of capital, not the incomes of other Americans.<sup>2</sup> <p>The work of most economists who have analyzed capital gains taxes and publicly available government data on who pays these taxes all indicate that the proponents are right and the critics are wrong. There are three major reasons why adopting capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 will benefit nearly every American.
<p>
<B>First</B>, the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income taxpayers rather than to the wealthy. When critics claim that capital gains go mainly to the wealthy, they mislead the public by including the gain when citing a person's income. In this way, a retiree living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000 capital gain one year on the sale of his house is classified as a "person with a $42,000 income who receives a capital gain." 
<p>
Contrary to what opponents suggest about who will benefit from these tax cuts, the typical household declaring a capital gain had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729 in 1991.<sup>3</sup>  The typical capital gain for this household was $973. About 11 percent of all taxpaying households declared a capital gain in 1991.
<p>
About 19 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains in 1991 contained more than one child. These households had an average income of $87,448 and an average capital gain of $1,178. 
<p>
Another 27 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains contained taxpayers over the age of 65 or blind. These taxpayers had an average income of $43,637 and an average capital gain of $2,151. It is particularly important that households containing children and elderly taxpayers be able to liquidate appreciated assets and realize as much after-tax income as possible if they are to pay for increasingly expensive educational and medical services.
<p>
As Table 1 shows, half of all capital gains were earned by households with incomes from other sources under $100,000, which also accounted for 52 percent of all non-capital gain income. 
<p>
<B>Second</B>, economists who have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy. One of the nation's most independent and celebrated models of the U.S. economy, the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model, found that balancing the budget with tax cuts produced immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and higher long-term economic activity.<sup>4</sup>  Each of this country's leading private economic consulting firms (DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates) recently predicted that balancing the budget with these tax cuts would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more spendable household income.<sup>5</sup><p>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates to determine the economic impact of the balanced budget plan.<sup>6</sup>  While this analysis found that the entire package of budget and tax cuts should result in generally higher economic activity, it also found that most of the economic benefits of the balanced budget plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
<p>
A Heritage simulation of the U.S. Macroeconomic Model that contained all of the spending and tax cuts for the period 1996 through 2002, except those for capital gains taxes, would result in consistently lower Gross Domestic Product in each of these seven years when compared with a simulation that included cuts in capital gains taxes. A little more than $80.2 billion in potential GDP is lost over seven years without capital gains tax relief.
<p>
According to the same simulation, in addition to lower GDP, the absence of cuts in capital gains taxes would lead to higher unemployment rates and slower household income growth. 
<p>
Critics of the bill should note that without the stimulus to new business activity provided by the capital gains tax cut, the other changes in tax policy are simply not great enough to offset the economic effects of reductions in the rate of government spending leading to a balanced federal budget.
<p>
<B>Third</B>, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would increase tax revenues from taxpayers who own most of the appreciated assets. Experience over the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps has high as $7.5 trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>7</sup>  Some economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. Many politicians agree. In an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, the two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>8</sup><p>Who would pay most of the additional capital gains taxes?  As Table 1 shows, these new government revenues would come principally from taxpayers with incomes above $200,000. If, indeed, the federal government wants to draw more tax revenue from wealthy Americans, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most effective ways possible to attain this objective.
<P>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<p>
The data about average incomes and capital gains declarations contained in this paper come from the IRS's Public Use File for 1991. This file contains about 115,000 composite tax returns that the IRS has constructed to reflect all 114 million returns filed in 1991. When these returns are multiplied by their statistical weights, the resulting number equals the total national number for a particular tax variable, e.g. capital gains declarations.
<p>
The income numbers contained in this paper were constructed by subtracting all capital gains declarations from adjusted gross income. What remains as income after this subtraction are such things as wages, interest and dividend payments, proprietorship and partnership income, and tax refunds from the previous tax year.

INTRODUCTION<b> 1</b>
<p>
The U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) was created in 1966 by consolidating several independent agencies devoted to specific transportation sectors, chiefly the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration, into a new Cabinet-level department. Also included in the new department were several transportation-related divisions from other departments, such as the Coast Guard (which had been at the Department of Commerce), together with newly established federal responsibilities for mass transit under the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964. In 1970, DOT added interstate passenger rail service to its duties when it took over money-losing passenger routes from private railroads and reorganized them as money-losing Amtrak. Several years later, for a brief period, the department was home to Conrail, a collection of bankrupt rail freight lines in the Northeast, which soon became one of the few federal privatization successes.
<p>
For this fiscal year, federal spending on transportation is budgeted at just over $39 billion. Nearly half -- $19 billion -- will be spent on highways, while roughly 25 percent -- $10 billion -- will be spent on aviation, primarily air traffic control operations and airport grants. Much of the department's spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished by the federal fuel tax that every consumer pays when he fills up his tank, and the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket tax and several lesser aviation user taxes.
<p>
Largely unchanged in structure and purpose since its creation in 1966, DOT has been the object of a number of recent reform proposals, including a recommendation by the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review that it be overhauled. Several of these proposed reforms, such as "corporatization" of the air traffic control system and consolidation of many surface transportation programs into infrastructure block grants that would be provided to the states, were part of the FY 1996 federal budget. At the same time, the Administration proposed to reduce slightly the amount of money the federal government spends on transportation over the next several years. 
<p>
These relatively modest reforms met with considerable opposition even among House Republicans, who wanted to maintain much of the nearly $40 billion the federal government spends on transportation each year. Fortunately, Senate Republicans have been more committed to fundamental reform, and this was represented in the House/Senate conference agreement on the FY 1996 budget resolution. Though somewhat vague on critical points, the conference report did commit Congress to downsizing and streamlining DOT, and even recommended privatization of the air traffic control system -- in contrast to the House Republicans' initial proposal to keep it as a government bureaucracy. The report, noting that the nation's infrastructure needs are not being met by the current centralized command structure, also urged greater privatization and federalism.
<p>
Specifically, the conference report proposes to phase out Amtrak, which will be cut by $205 million from last year, and mass transit operating subsidies, which will be cut by $300 million. Other areas of transportation, however, receive substantial increases. Spending on highways would rise a staggering $880 million over last year, while $660 million will be provided to start 30 new transit systems, most of which will be in light rail, the least cost-effective of the options available to Americans. This reflects a $19 million increase over last year's new start spending, and is significantly more than President Clinton recommended in proposing only 12 new transit starts in his 1996 budget.
<p>
This reluctance to impose fiscal discipline is troubling. Even worse is the record the House is compiling in attempting to reform the restrictive labor practices past Congresses have forced on Amtrak and local transit systems, as well as Davis-Bacon Act provisions affecting highways. In July, efforts to reform costly labor practices and mandates on mass transit and Amtrak were defeated overwhelmingly as many House Republicans joined with Democrats to vote down every reform proposal put forward as part of the transportation appropriations bill.
<p>
Although too modest in scope, the Clinton Administration's proposals could help reinvigorate the process of fundamental transportation reform that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan Administration, and the House/Senate conference report at least includes general endorsements of reform, decentralization, and privatization. The Administration's proposals implicitly recognize that DOT's duties are largely commercial in nature and might better be left to the states or to the private sector. In the past, the federal government often helped facilitate the more rapid commercialization of a new technology (aviation) or a new concept (limited-access interstate highways). Generally, however, the Department has simply preserved, at considerable taxpayer expense, such inefficient transportation concepts as urban mass transit monopolies or poorly managed interstate passenger rail service. Despite its early successes in highways and aviation, federal involvement in these areas has become costly, bureaucratic, and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves the privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees, and unions that benefit financially from the status quo.
<p>
It is time for Congress to recognize that continued federal involvement in transportation is an inefficient use of society's scarce resources. To decrease the costs and decentralize the management of America's transportation system, the Department of Transportation should be closed down, and most of today's federal transportation responsibilities should be returned to individual states, local communities, or the private sector. Such actions would have the effect of continuing the successful transportation policies of the late Carter Administration and early Reagan Administration, when airlines, interstate rail freight, trucking, and the moving industry were deregulated to the considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers, and businesses.
<p>
Specifically, Congress needs to institute major reforms in several areas of transportation policy:
<p>
<b>Surface Transportation</b><br> 
Congress should return to the states much of the responsibility, with the necessary resources, to operate and fund those transportation functions that are the province of government. Most transportation concerns are local in nature, and continuing to force politically influenced, centralized solutions on local problems will be no more successful in the future than it has been in the past.
<p>
Today, the federal government determines how much will be spent on transportation infrastructure, raises the money, and then decides how it will be distributed and divided among the many different forms of transport -- such as highways, mass transit, aviation, and rail passenger services -- in accordance with a central plan developed by the DOT, Congress, and the states and influenced by the many private industries that depend on federal grants and contracts. Costly strings are attached to these funds in the form of dozens of mandates, directives, and special set-asides to satisfy certain constituencies. 
<p>
Congress can reverse this process in 1997 when the legislation authorizing the DOT's largest program -- the Highway Trust Fund -- and the taxes that support it expires. Funded with an 11.5 cent share of the 18.4 cent per gallon federal gas tax, the trust fund each year takes in and disburses approximately $20 billion on highways, bridges, and mass transit initiatives. The program should be allowed to expire as scheduled so the states can assume this relinquished taxing authority to fund their own transportation programs. As an interim step, all the money collected by the federal government through the fuel tax should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in exact proportion to the amount collected in each state. The accumulated balance in the trust fund, now approaching $18 billion, should be returned to the states in proportion to the amount paid in once the federal budget reaches balance, as scheduled, in the year 2002.
<p>
This block grant would be unrestricted except for a requirement that it be used for transportation, with each state free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs. For states needing rail passenger service, a portion of the funds could be used to maintain some or all of the lines that formerly were part of Amtrak. For heavily urbanized states, funds could support mass transit beyond revenues generated by fares. And for most states, most of the money would continue to support highway and bridge programs. After 1997, when the federal fuel tax author-ity expires, states could assume responsibility for the tax <b>2</b> or could develop other funding mechanisms, including taxes, user fees, greater private investor participation, and tolls, to maintain and sustain their own transportation program.
<p>
<b>The End of Mandates</b><br> 
Also terminated should be the large and costly collection of federal mandates, regulations, and prohibitions that have inflated state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative, low-cost transportation solutions. Mandates associated with federal highway funds force states to incur additional costs that may equal as much as 80 percent of the federal funds received. For the federal transit programs, the costs of fulfilling federal mandates can be two to three times the value of the federal subsidy. Ending these mandates would increase substantially the buying power of a transportation block grant, and eliminating the many federal restrictions discouraging states from forming partnerships with private investors to develop or rehabilitate highways and bridges would allow states open access to substantial pools of private development capital. 
<p>
<b>Urban Mass Transit</b><br> 
The most important action Congress can take to reform surface transportation is to terminate the Federal Transit Administration, the most wasteful and counterproductive of all DOT programs. Federal spending on local transit initiatives runs in excess of $4 billion per year, part of which is financed from the 1.5 cent share of the federal fuel tax. Urban and community transit programs are almost entirely local in nature, have few (if any) national ramifications, and derive only about five percent of their operating funds from the federal government. But because of federal mandates, including costly provisions that directly benefit organized labor, the hidden cost to the community may be two to three times higher than the value of the subsidy itself. Thus, all existing federal transit legislation also should be amended to remove all federally imposed mandates and restrictive labor practices. Once the program is terminated and the laws amended, states would be free to fund mass transit programs through the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<b>Amtrak</b><br> 
As part of a comprehensive reform of DOT surface transportation programs, all federal funding to Amtrak should end and Amtrak's management should be encouraged to work with interested and affected states to develop creative ways to maintain cost-efficient service. States could use a portion of the new transportation block grant to maintain some local or regional rail service in cooperation with other states and Amtrak, or its successor entity. To this end, the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 should be amended to eliminate excessive labor protections and Amtrak's federally enforced monopoly status. In addition, an eight-state compact to maintain and fund operations in the Northeast Corridor should be pre-approved by Congress and the formal transfer of assets (rolling stock, road bed, stations) to the new consortium included in the legislation terminating Amtrak. Popular long-haul routes should be privatized separately to take better advantage of their tourism potential. 
<p>
<b>Aviation</b><br> 
DOT aviation programs, operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and financed largely from the airport trust fund, should be privatized (in the case of air traffic control) or fully devolved to the states (airports). Aviation safety responsibilities should remain with the federal government in a new transportation safety agency. Specifically, and similar to proposals of the Senate Budget Committee, the National Performance Review, and the Clinton Administration, the FAA should be split into three parts. The air traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation, funded by direct user fees, and ultimately privatized; the airport improvement program, and the taxes and fees that fund it, should be turned over to the states and localities. Meanwhile, the safety, licensing, inspection and training functions of the FAA should be carried out either by an independent federal aviation safety agency or by a new government agency that also deals with safety issues related to highways, boats, rail, and other forms of transportation.
<p>
As part of this change, the airport trust fund, with a balance now in excess of $12 billion, should be dissolved and the federal passenger ticket tax ended. A portion of the balance could be used to fund some of the potentially high transition costs involved in privatizing the air traffic control system and to honor existing commitments under the airport improvement program. Once the federal budget is balanced, the remaining funds could be returned to existing airport authorities in proportion to ticket taxes previously collected.
<p>
Existing federal laws, mandates, and prohibitions governing airports should be amended or eliminated to allow greater freedom for airport managers and more private sector participation in airport ownership, construction, development, and management. With these mandates ended, airports would be free to establish their own charges, fees, or taxes on aircraft or passengers in order to fund ongoing operations and improvements.
<p>
<b>The Coast Guard</b><br> 
The Coast Guard's chief responsibilities now focus largely on law enforcement. Congress therefore should transfer the Coast Guard and its coastal security and interdiction functions to the Department of Justice, so that its activities can be coordinated more effectively with those of other federal law enforcement agencies. Other, less pressing duties could be shifted to the private sector, the states, or other agencies. Basic rescue responsibilities, for example, could be turned over to existing private competitors and volunteer organizations, with government retaining responsibility only in the event of extreme emergencies and severe weather conditions beyond the scope and resources of the private sector. Boat safety responsibilities should devolve to the states, where most other transport safety issues already are lodged. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take over the Coast Guard's anti-pollution responsibilities, and states or regional authorities should assume responsibility for maintaining navigational aids, policing waterways, and icebreaking.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be terminated except for its international regulatory roles, which should be transferred to the Department of State or the U.S. Trade Representative. Safety functions and responsibilities should be retained in an independent federal agency. The Maritime Administration and Congress's long, counterproductive interference with the ocean shipping industry have succeeded only in destroying America's once proud maritime heritage. The price, in addition to considerable taxpayer expense, has been the loss of thousands of jobs.
<p>
<br>
<b>FEDERAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM</b><br>
Today's federal highway programs began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1944 Federal Highway Aid Act which earmarked $1.6 billion for highways over three years, and Dwight D. Eisenhower's Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956. The former created the federal responsibility; the latter shaped the program that exists today. Specifically, the 1956 Act called for completion of a 41,000-mile interstate highway system by 1972 and created the Highway Trust Fund, financed by a federal excise tax on gasoline, as a long-term source of federal funds for road construction. 
<p>
Congress originally intended the highway program to be a federally assisted state program.<b>3</b> But over time, as more and more federal mandates and money have been added, it has become a state-assisted federal program. A $30 billion program with a fifteen-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now thirty years behind schedule.
<p>
Although the broad objectives of federal involvement have been met, the federal highway program, operating out of Washington as a centrally managed monopoly incorporating the ideas and transportation concepts of the 1950s, is no longer what America needs. It also is no longer consistent with the original intent of a federally funded state program. With the national highway system largely completed, and with existing and emerging surface transportation issues predominantly local or regional in nature, a centralized, one-size-fits-all program makes little fiscal, management, or creative sense.
<p>
<b>Unresponsive and Bureaucratic.</b> The principal weakness in the current federal system is its centralized allocation of financial resources according to mechanical formulas based more on political influence than on transportation needs. Money collected at the state level from individual drivers whenever they fill their gas tanks is funneled to Washington, where a little less than two-thirds is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund for reallocation back to the states for a variety of federally determined purposes in federally determined proportions. 
<p>
Of the 18.4 cents per gallon now paid at the pump in federal excise taxes, only 10 cents goes to highways. Of the remainder, 1.5 cents goes to mass transit, 0.1 cents to cleaning up leaking storage tanks, and 6.8 cents to the government generally. On October 1, 1995, the highway dedication will rise by 20 percent to 12 cents per gallon and the transit dedication will rise by one-third to 2 cents per gallon. These increases will be financed by reducing the 6.8 cent highway tax support for general government (no overall tax increase will occur).<b>4</b> Similar diversions of tax funding from deficit reduction to highways and mass transit will occur at the same time with respect to other motor fuel taxes.
<p>
How much money each state receives from the fund is determined according to an elaborate mechanical formula which has left a trail of winners and losers. Since its inception in 1956, states such as Alaska and Hawaii, along with the District of Columbia, have received in grants substantially more than they have paid into the fund, while states such as South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin have received just over half the amount they have paid in fuel taxes.<b>5</b>
<p>
Once the aggregate allocation is determined, the money returned to the states is earmarked for specific types of projects as determined jointly by members and staff of key congressional committees and staff and officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In the 1995 budget, developed in cooperation with President Clinton and the 103rd Congress, $20.1 billion in federal highway aid was allocated in specific amounts to such programs as the national highway system, the surface transportation program, the bridge program, interstate completion, interstate maintenance, interstate substitutions, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, intelligent vehicle highway systems, emergency relief, federal lands, administration and research (more than $700 million), demonstration projects, high priority corridors, highway-related safety grants, motor carrier safety grants, and miscellaneous appropriations of a quarter of a billion dollars for 80 specific highway projects mandated by Members of Congress for their states or districts.<b>6</b>
<p>
In addition to the predetermined allocations among the states and between specific types of highway projects, Washington determines how much and what types of urban mass transit assistance each state receives, how much passenger rail service is available to it and at what cost, and how much money will be provided for airport construction, improvement, and modernization.
<p>
<b>Miles of Red Tape.</b> In order to receive these predetermined funding allocations, states and local communities must agree to adhere to a growing list of mandates that substantially raise the cost of meeting transportation needs, thereby actually diminishing the amount of transport services that each federal dollar can buy. Chief among these counterproductive mandates are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Construction Wage Laws. The Davis-Bacon Act of 1932 requires that any project receiving federal funds must pay workers the area's "prevailing wage" as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. In most cases, this means above-market union wages and adds an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent to the cost of affected projects.<b>7</b>
<p>
<li>Environmental Regulations. Threatening to withhold federal highway funds is one way the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the DOT, frequently forces states to apply a variety of environmental regulations to car drivers. As a result of these threats and mandates, for example, drivers in certain areas of the country must undergo costly mandatory emissions inspections and switch seasonally to more costly and less efficient oxygenated fuels to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and photo-chemical smog to national standards established by the EPA. 
<p>
These substantial costs are forced on automobile owners despite the absence of conclusive epidemiological evidence that these emissions adversely affect human health. And while the health and environmental benefits of these and other regulations are uncertain and questionable, the financial benefits of the oxygenated fuels mandate to the ethanol industry are both substantial and obvious. In addition to these restrictions, new highway construction projects must be preceded by costly and time-consuming environmental impact statements.
<p>
<li>Safety Regulations. Similar threats have been used to require states to enforce costly safety initiatives, such as the recently repealed, federally mandated 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that added to costs, inconvenience, and congestion on the highways while making only a negligible contribution to decreased deaths, injuries, and property damage.<b>8</b> Such regulations have been wholly inappropriate and counterproductive to states, and regions within states, characterized by low population densities, as well as to regions where long-distance driving often is essential for employment and other day-to-day tasks.
<p>
<li>Miscellaneous Regulations and Mandates. Other federal requirements and mandates linked to federal highway funds include driver's license screening procedures for controlled substances, safety belt enforcement, drug-free workplace requirements, creating and maintaining a problem driver point system, commercial motor vehicle safety provisions, enforcement of the Truth in Mileage Act, requirements for minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise contracting, implementation of sound abatement barriers, bicycle paths and right of ways, metric conversion, establishment of an information data base system, hazardous waste operations, emergency response training programs, treatment of storm water runoff, compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as it relates to recipients of federal grants, and utilization of pulverized, recycled rubber in highway paving and repaving materials. A recent study of the cost of highway-related federal mandates imposed on California concluded that California incurred expenses of $1.8 billion to fulfill these mandates so it could receive $2.3 billion in federal highway money. <b>9</b>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need to End Federal Limits and Prohibitions on Tolls and Private Investor Participation.</b> Among the most damaging federal requirements are the limits on the extent to which states can charge tolls and work in partnership with private-sector investors. Highways funded in whole or in part by the Highway Trust Fund may neither charge any tolls (except for a small number of Washington-approved demonstration projects) nor be developed or renovated with private investor participation. Thus, an opportunity to add significantly to the funds available for highway construction -- at no cost to the taxpayer -- is foregone, and America's ability to meet its transportation needs is held hostage to federal funding limits and allocations established by Congress and DOT staff. For example, an estimated 230,000 highway bridges need significant repair at a projected cost of $60 billion or more.<b>10</b> In this year's budget, the Clinton Administration requested just $2.6 billion in FY 1996 for bridges under the Federal Aid to Highways program, or just less than 5 percent of the estimated need.<b>11</b>
<p>
In addition to the unnecessary limits on resources that it creates, the prohibition on tolls precludes opportunities to contribute, however modestly, to the alleviation of congestion and the better utilization of existing transportation resources through market pricing mechanisms. For example, the major surface transportation issue in communities throughout the country is congestion, generally associated with commuting and rush hour travel. With existing highways offered to consumers (drivers) as a "free good," or at least as a pre-paid service, drivers have no financial incentive to alter their schedules or their mode of transportation so they might use this valuable asset more efficiently to minimize congestion. To induce drivers to alter their travel plans to diminish congestion during peak travel periods associated either with holidays or workday rush hours, tolls could be levied (or increased where they already exist) on specific bridges or highways, as appropriate. This would encourage some individuals to defer travel, to utilize an alternative mode of transportation such as public transit or car pools, or take a different route.
<p>
Such congestion pricing tolls have been implemented in several cities in Europe and Asia (for instance, Bergen, Oslo, and Singapore), and public transit systems in Washington, D.C., and several other U.S. cities charge a premium for rush hour travel on buses and subways to encourage riders to shift travel to off-peak times. Although by no means a panacea, there is no reason why this concept could not be applied selectively to auto travel in the United States in those places and along those routes where existing traffic patterns make it possible and where driving patterns may be sensitive to price incentives. Unfortunately, federal prohibitions and habit deter its use, so efforts are limited to public exhortations urging citizens to ride buses or join car pools. 
<p>
Until recently, placing tolls on congested urban roads and bridges was not always economically practical because the collection costs and ensuing delays would likely have worsened the situation. However, new technologies allow electronic assessment of tolls from moving cars and trucks, using inexpensive transponders or receivers mounted on the vehicles. In the United States such automated systems have been implemented on the Crescent City Connection 12-lane bridge in New Orleans, the 17-mile North Dallas Tollway,<b>12</b> and the Oklahoma toll road system.
<p>
Allowing for tolls creates opportunities for the private sector to develop and operate highways or to participate as partners with government in highway construction and operation. While private toll roads are common in Western Europe, and several are under construction (or planned) in several places in the U.S., their use has been limited severely by prohibitions and constraints at both the state and federal levels. Many states simply prohibit privately owned highways, while others tightly regulate them and require an elaborate and costly approval process. At the federal level, while there are no outright prohibitions on private highways, there have been tight controls on the extent to which private and public moneys can be commingled in infrastructure investments developed on a for-profit basis, and these controls have largely discouraged any private interest.<b>13</b>
<p>
At the same time, ambiguities regarding ownership of existing federally supported public roads, as well as federal anti-toll provisions, deter the creation of for-profit public/private partnerships that could rehabilitate, modernize, or widen -- at little or no taxpayer expense -- an existing public road that once received federal funding for some or all of its construction. Until very recently, there was no formal legal mechanism to allow for the sale or disposal of such highways, or to assess properly a reimbursement payment to offset the past federal investment. As a consequence, previously built highways in need of rehabilitation, modernization, and widening must wait their turn and compete politically with other highway projects for federal grant money. In recent years, executive orders promulgated by both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have resolved some, but not all, of these problems. 
<p>
Private-sector participation would allow some highway rehabilitation projects (particularly for well-traveled highways with restricted access) to receive immediate attention and financing at no cost to the taxpayer. A partnership could be formed between the state or local community and private investors, who would provide the funds to widen and resurface the aging highway to current standards and needs and be compensated for the effort, risk, and investment by receiving a portion of the tolls collected on the highway. The community's transportation needs would be addressed sooner and for less money (thanks in part to no federal red tape, which adds at least 20 percent to 30 percent to highway costs). Meanwhile, those who benefit the most -- the drivers who use the new road -- would pay for it in direct proportion to usage and benefits received.
<p>
Private highway projects currently are under construction in Virginia and California, and others are planned for Minnesota and Washington State. Private toll roads have long been in operation in France, Germany, and Italy and are underway in Argentina, Chile, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, and Mexico.<b>14</b>
<p>
Although toll roads, including hundreds built and operated by private companies, played an important role in the early development of America's transportation infrastructure, the growing federalization of the highway system over the past forty years has discouraged and formally prohibited both private sector participation and the use of tolls on public roads. The rationale for this prohibition is thin and merits brief discussion. 
<p>
<b>Haven't We already Paid For It?</b> The chief argument used against tolls and highway privatization is that drivers already have paid for the highway through the federal fuel tax and Highway Trust Fund, which roughly relates taxes paid to highway usage. Under these circumstances, it is argued, any additional levies or user fees would be unfair and redundant. But this exaggerates the extent to which fuel taxes paid by individuals actually fund the highways, as well as the correspondence between costs incurred and benefits received. Further, it vastly overstates the ability of the user fee, as currently configured, to finance the U.S. highway and bridge system to the desired level of quality and capability.
<p>
A principal complaint about the existing user fee system is that less than 55 percent of the tax goes to highways, suggesting that any reference to the gas tax as a user fee is misleading. Further distorting the relationship between fees paid and benefits received is the fact that a disproportionate share of federal highway money goes to just 22 percent of U.S. road miles, which includes the interstate highway system and, to a lesser extent, its arterials and collectors. It does not include local roads, however, so auto owners whose driving is primarily local pay the federal fuel tax without receiving much in the way of direct benefits. 
<p>
In a similar vein, drivers who pay to use existing toll roads, such as the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Turnpikes or Interstate 95 between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, also pay the gas tax, yet are not eligible for a rebate due to double taxation. Indeed, the price of fuel sold on these toll roads includes the federal fuel tax. Also distorting the relationship between fees and benefits is the fact that while different types of vehicles impose significantly different costs on highways, these differences are not reflected properly in the fees they pay. Heavy trucks, for example, cause substantially more wear and tear than is covered by the various fees and taxes they pay.<b>15</b>
<p>
Thus, it is not true that bridge and highway tolls are unfair because they would distort the relationship between fees and usage. The addition of more road and bridge tolls dedicated exclusively to highway improvement actually would enhance the correspondence between what drivers pay and what they in turn receive.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li><b>Do not reauthorize the federal highway and transit program.</b>
<p> 
Federal motor fuel taxes should be allowed to expire as scheduled.<b>16</b> This would constitute complete and final devolution of the program to the states, which would finance their highway, transit, and leaking underground storage tank needs as they see fit (probably by increasing state motor fuels taxes or substituting a state fuel tax for the terminated federal fuel tax).
<p>
Abolish the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (49 USC app. 1651 note).
<p>
<li><b>Devolve the federal highway program to the states.</b> 
<p>
This would require repeal of Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with the exception of Sections 204, 205, 210, 212, 215, 216, and 218, and would comport with the original intent of the law that the federal highway program be a state program. Full devolution to the states is appropriate, since local governments are units of state government. Research programs would be financed by the states and by private-sector interests in the highway industry. 
<p>
Devolving the program would involve several actions:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Before the scheduled re-authorization, all federal motor fuel taxes dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in proportion to their collection. 
<li>All federal mandates (funded, underfunded, and unfunded) should be removed. This could be accomplished by simple legislative language such as the following:<b>17</b> "Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, states shall have the right to waive any federal requirement in Title 23 and Title 49 Section 1601 et seq." 
<li>The returned funds should be subject to conventional state legislative and administrative procedures.<b>18</b>
<li>Return the balance in the Highway Trust Fund to the states from federal budget surpluses earned after the federal budget is balanced.<b>19</b>
<li>Disbursements should be based on a formula that reasonably approximates prior state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Establish an Office of Interstate Highway Cooperation.
<p>
This office could be created either as an independent agency or within a successor entity that absorbed remaining responsibilities of terminated or consolidated agencies. It would bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states (such as designation of interstate and USC highway numbers). Minimal funding would be required.
<p>
<li>Transfer International Programs to the Department of State (23 USC 212, 216, and 218).
<p>
Included in DOT are numerous transportation responsibilities with international ramifications, such as landing rights for air carriers, limits on fares, negotiated shipping rates, and safety issues. These matters could be handled better by the Department of State in coordination with other diplomatic issues.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Federal Lands Highway Program, forest development roads and trails highways, and territorial highway program to the Department of the Interior or its successor agency (49 USC 204, 205, and 215).
<p>
<li>Transfer defense access roads to the Department of Defense (49 USC 210).
<p>
<li>Terminate separate highway programs of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and consolidate these responsibilities into the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<br>
<b>HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is responsible for regulatory and other programs involving highway and vehicle safety. In addition, the Office of Motor Carriers deals with safety issues associated with interstate bus and truck transportation, and the Office of Research and Special Programs includes or oversees several other related efforts including Hazardous Materials Safety, Pipeline Safety, the Transportation Safety Institute, and university research programs. 
<p>
All of these programs should be reviewed for effectiveness or redundancy and to determine whether they are more properly the province of the states. Once reviewed and restructured, the remaining federal safety responsibilities should be transferred to a newly created independent federal entity  an Interstate Transportation Safety Office (or Administration) -- which includes all the other transportation safety responsibilities now within DOT, such as those of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Maritime Administration. 
<p>
As part of this review, Congress should consider creating national maximum vehicle safety standards to discourage states from imposing more restrictive regulations that impede interstate commerce and add unnecessarily to costs. A possible precedent for such federal maximum standards is the standards promulgated and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the manufactured housing industry. Again, however, highway safety programs are more legitimately the province of the states.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (23 USC 401).
<p>
<li>Merge vehicle-related interstate safety programs into the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office.
<p>
<li>Devolve the remaining non-interstate highway safety programs to the states.
<p>
<li>Merge any critical statistical functions into the Census Bureau or its successor agency.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION</b>
<p>
Created by the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 and administered by DOT's Federal Transit Administration, the federal transit program is a costly failure:  Mass transit's market position today is the same as 31 years ago when Congress passed the Act. The program has consistently led to unwise transportation decisions by state and local authorities, encouraged local transit monopolies, and precluded the adoption of cost-effective operating methods and innovative solutions.
<p>
Although funding from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and other federal revenues provide only a small fraction of the financial resources available to urban mass transit systems, the many regulations and mandates attached to federal funding have had a profoundly adverse influence on local transit policy. Despite the billions of dollars of state, local, and federal money invested in costly transit systems over the past 30 years, annual transit trips per capita have declined by one-third, and barely two percent of person trips today are by transit. In addition, transit's work trip (commuter) market share declined from 1980 to 1990 in 36 of the nation's 39 metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million.<b>20</b>
<p>
<b>Monopolistic Control.</b> Transit's vastly diminished status reflects more than a century of government meddling and government-sanctioned and protected monopolies, whether public or private. Private transit companies and systems emerged in the late 19th century and grew rapidly in response to the growth of the urban population during the industrial revolution. Although private in origin, these rail-based companies quickly became monopolies by obtaining exclusive franchises from local and state governments. As early as the second decade of this century, governments in city after city outlawed jitneys (independently owned and operated buses), eliminating any competitive threat that might confront the private transit monopolists.
<p>
Unfortunately for these transit companies, their government protection from competition was not without its cost. Over the ensuing decades, these private systems were subject to price controls on their fares, mandatory service on designated routes, and mandated frequency of service. At the same time, they became easy prey for organized labor, which could shut down an entire city because all competing systems and companies had been eliminated. Private transit systems had little choice but to accede to exorbitant union wage demands and work rule requirements. These work rules are still in force, but in the public transit sector where federal mandates help maintain organized labor's privileged position in local systems.<b>21</b>
<p>
Local governments could suppress organized business competition to their protected transit franchisees, but they could not suppress the striving of individual commuters for something better. These individuals began to exercise their free will and seek a more convenient and cost-effective solution by driving their cars to work and to market. Subject to heavy government regulation and high labor costs, and thus unable to compete, the private transit monopolists began to face serious financial problems as their customers went elsewhere. With harsh labor contracts precluding cost savings through labor efficiencies, transit companies turned to deferred maintenance, capital acquisition, and reductions in other services. The ensuing deterioration in service further discouraged customers, and revenues continued to decline until the systems went bankrupt. One by one, they were taken over by local governments or multi-jurisdictional transit authorities. Taxpayer-supported public monopolies replaced the private ones that had failed.
<p>
<b>The Federal Takeover.</b> The next step was to get the federal government involved. This occurred in 1964 with the enactment of the Urban Mass Transit Act, which provided for capital grants to fund up to 75 percent of local projects. Section 13(c) of the Act also effectively codified organized labor's privileged position within the transit system by requiring, as a condition of federal aid, that a transit authority sign a U.S. Department of Labor-approved contract with transit unions. Among other things, these mandated agreements generally include provisions requiring a six-year severance payment for transit employees dismissed because of efficiency measures.
<p>
This Act was just one of several pieces of federal legislation during the 1960s that shifted heretofore local responsibilities such as housing, transit, and welfare to the federal government, all with disastrous results. Ten years later, in 1974, the Urban Mass Transit Act was amended to extend federal support to operating subsidies as part of a national energy conservation effort. Today, the federal government spends about $4 billion each year to help subsidize a service that millions of consumers overwhelmingly reject in growing numbers:  Just over five percent of employees now get to work using public transit.
<p>
<b>Impact of Cutting Off Federal Subsidies.</b> Because federal support accounts for only about five percent of transit operating costs, and because existing transit system borrowing capabilities would be sufficient to add more and replace existing capital assets, the termination of all federal subsidies would have little initial negative impact on transit's ability to serve its dwindling customer base. Indeed, encouraging greater self-reliance and removing all of the costly and counterproductive mandates attached to federal grants and subsidies would leave enterprising transit authorities financially better off, because the estimated cost of these mandates is more than two to three times the value of the subsidy.<b>22</b> For FY 1996, the House/Senate conference report on the budget proposes a substantial reduction in federal financial support of transit but stops short of recommending the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration, as proposed originally by the House.
<p>
With the provisions of Section 13(c) eliminated and no longer able to disrupt productive labor-management relations, transit authorities could adopt widely available cost savings opportunities through such practices as competitive contracting and better management of existing workforce. Because of the lack of incentives for properly managing existing personnel, and because of the many restrictive work rules common to its federally approved labor contracts, America's public transit industry has been the only major industry to experience a decline in labor productivity during the 1980s. Over that period, transit's productivity fell a staggering 40 percent compared with an increase in all other transportation sectors, including even Amtrak.<b>23</b>
<p>
The combination of rising wages and falling productivity has had a profoundly adverse effect on transit's cost structure. Unit costs (costs per mile or hour) are often double, or more expensive than market costs for the same services, even when provided by private contractors using union labor. As a result, U.S. transit cost escalation has been greater than that of health care and greater than that of transit systems in other developed nations.<b>24</b>
<p>
As long as the federal government is there to bail them out, transit authorities have no incentive to become more efficient or to adopt management techniques common to other businesses, and local communities and governments, which oversee these transit systems, have no incentive to interfere or to exercise their responsibility on behalf of their constituents and transit's customers. Without the federal cushion and indirect oversight, local governments could restructure their transit systems in ways that serve the customer, not managers and employees and Washington bureaucrats that devise and enforce the regulations and mandates.
<p>
With the federal government no longer providing capital grants that mandate certain types of equipment, transit authorities also would be free to acquire less expensive but more suitable equipment. Moreover, with transit authorities now fully responsible for servicing the debt incurred to acquire the equipment, these capital assets would be better maintained than has been the practice.<b>25</b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Competition.</b> Chief among the necessary reforms is opening the local transit market to competition by eliminating the legal monopoly now held by all transit authorities. Today, anyone offering services in competition with existing public transit is in violation of various criminal and civil statutes. As the limited contracting out done by transit services demonstrates, private-sector providers, often using unionized workers, are able to provide the same service for less money, make a profit, pay taxes, and service the debt on their equipment -- four simple tasks that no public transit service in the country could hope to accomplish. 
<p>
While the potential cost savings are considerable, the real benefit to consumers from competition is the creativity that it will unleash in devising innovative solutions to traditional problems. In the hands of government monopolies, U.S. transit systems now rely on a combination of solutions and services that have not evolved much beyond those that were developed between 1880 and 1920, except that they cost much more and offer less convenient service. Not surprisingly, modern Americans have little interest in a type of service that was becoming obsolete when their grandparents were coming of age.
<p>
Typical of Congress's fascination with 19th century technologies are the costly light rail systems it has funded in communities across the United States, notwithstanding a pervasive lack of commuter interest. The "new start" rail capital program has financed some of the most costly and ineffective pork-barrel projects in the nation, despite the absence of any evidence from anywhere in the world that urban rail lines reduce traffic congestion. These systems involve sometimes staggering costs. According to one recent report, the congressionally approved Tasman Corridor, a $500 million, 12.4-mile light rail line in California linking Milpitas and Mountain View, will cost $33 for each new rider.<b>26</b>
<p>
A DOT study by Harvard economists indicates that bus-ways can be built and operated for one-fifth the cost of new rail systems.<b>27</b> But rail systems have become a federally financed way to enhance civic pride and accommodate the preferences of hobbyists and rail buffs. Virtually all academic researchers not dependent upon income from the transit industry or the Federal Transit Administration agree that building publicly financed rail transit is indefensible. 
<p>
Even if the cost could be justified, no element of today's local transit programs calls for federal involvement. Transit programs are, by definition, local in scope, and where two or three states are involved in the same system, interstate compacts can be formed to provide region-wide management and help raise the funds needed to maintain the service. Removing the federal government from local transit matters would leave state and local governments free to devise their own solutions, reduce costs by getting rid of federal red tape, and adopt creative solutions from a competitive private sector that stands to profit by serving its customers. 
<p>
Supporters of the status quo argue that there is no money to be made in transit and that the financial failures of government-regulated monopolies in the 1950s and 1960s prove this. What they really prove, of course, is the counterproductive effects of government-sanctioned anti-competitive practices and regulation. Today, scores of profit-making, private transit firms bid eagerly on every government contract offered, and at prices below the level charged by public transit. The only thing that prevents a flood of private buses, vans, and taxis from offering low-cost, for-profit transit services in cities and suburbs is the threat of legal action from government.  
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Transit Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the federal transit program (49 USC Chapter 21).<br> 
States should be free to provide financial support to their transit systems through the transportation block grant proposed in the previous section or through other means.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees rail safety, rail subsidies, and rail research. It also administers the Northeast Corridor rail rehabilitation project and owns and administers the Transportation Test Center, staffed by the Association of American Railroads. Only one of these functions -- interstate rail safety -- is an appropriate federal activity. Research should be funded by the railroad industry. 
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Railroad Administration (49 USC APP. 1652).
<p>
<li>Repeal all FRA functions not involving interstate rail safety.
<p>
<li>Sell the Transportation Test Center to the private sector. 
<p>
<li>Merge rail safety programs into the proposed Office of Interstate Transportation Safety. 
<p>
<br>
<b>THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (Amtrak)</b><br>
The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) was created in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail service. Conceived as a two-year federally assisted experiment, Amtrak has managed to survive for 25 years at a cumulative cost to the taxpayer of over $17 billion plus interest. With a fleet of approximately 2,200 cars and engines operating on over 25,000 miles of track, Amtrak carries approximately 22 million passengers a year. 
<p>
President Clinton's budget proposed a subsidy of $750 million for FY 1996 and assumed that Amtrak will adopt substantial reforms to make itself more commercially viable and reduce its reliance on federal operating subsidies. Although the original House Republican proposal was even more generous, the House/Senate budget conference cut more than $200 million from Amtrak. However, efforts to reform operations, particularly onerous labor requirements, failed as many House Republicans voted with the Democrats to preserve the extraordinary privileges in organized labor's Amtrak contract. This failed reform effort illustrates why it is time to terminate the federal subsidy at the end of this fiscal year, giving Amtrak time to develop a strategic plan to achieve financial independence from the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Amtrak's Marginal Impact on America's Transport Needs.</b> Carrying less than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers, Amtrak has become a costly burden on the taxpayer. Proposed for termination in several budgets during the Reagan Administration, it has been kept alive by Congress, which has provided billions in annual subsidies in return for promises that the corporation would become commercially viable. It never has, and those who believe it will in the future are allowing hope to triumph over experience and good sense. Despite 25 years of reform efforts and promises, the best the government has been able to do is to reduce the annual subsidy from over a billion dollars during the Carter Administration to about half that during the Reagan Presidency. Under Clinton the subsidy has been creeping back up to Jimmy Carter levels of generosity. 
<p>
After years of mismanagement, overly generous labor agreements, and intense competition from airlines and long-haul buses, Amtrak's financial situation has deteriorated, and its prospects for improvement are even more illusory than in the past. In December 1994, as a result of competitive pressures on revenues, higher than expected operating costs, and a serious accident, Amtrak's budget went even deeper into the red, forcing the company to announce a series of major route and service cuts to stay within its existing budget and federal subsidy. Faced with persistent competition from private buses and airlines, Amtrak will continue to struggle with a worsening deficit, in addition to which deferred maintenance, an aging fleet (23 years per car today, compared with 17.5 years in 1989), and rapid depreciation of the Northeast Corridor's roadbed will likely cause operating and essential capital costs to escalate rapidly, requiring even larger taxpayer subsidies.
<p>
Amtrak represents a failed attempt to convert inter-city rail service from a subsidized system to a self-sustaining, profitable system. Amtrak achieves a significant market share only in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston) -- and only with heavy subsidies per rider. In virtually all other markets, eliminating service would have no discernible impact on transportation facilities (highways and airports), because Amtrak's market share is infinitesimal.
<p>
To compensate for the loss of federal financial support, Amtrak's strategic survival plan should include privatization of commercially viable routes; partnerships with other transportation, travel, and recreational entities; or regional public-private partnerships through more aggressive use of the 403(b) provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which allow for greater cost sharing with states and local communities served by Amtrak. In the event that the mid-Atlantic and northeast states served by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operation find the service of value to their citizens and businesses, they could use some portion of their proposed transportation block grant or state-controlled fuel tax to keep regional Amtrak service in operation. To facilitate this, the DOT should be prepared to conduct an orderly transfer of necessary assets and responsibilities -- chiefly the rolling stock and roadbed -- to the affected states.
<p>
Existing law and practice allow for this, and there is precedent for state takeover of routes abandoned for budgetary purposes. Under the Section 403(b) provisions of the Act, and in response to Amtrak's elimination of several costly and wasteful lines, California will take over daily Amtrak service between San Francisco and Sacramento.
<p>
There is no public purpose to be served by further taxpayer support of Amtrak. Nor is there any practical reason to phase out federal support only gradually, as many in Congress suggest. A careful reading of 25 years of presidential budget proposals and congressional appropriations bills for transportation, shows annual promises by Amtrak to get its house in order. But Amtrak has never delivered on its promises, and never will. This Congress should distinguish itself from its predecessors by being the first not to be fooled by Amtrak's bureaucracy or its powerful unions.
<p>
<br>
<b>The High Speed Rail Program</b><br> 
In addition to subsidizing Amtrak, the DOT subsidizes a costly high speed rail program designed to encourage the development of high speed rail corridors. This program serves no useful purpose because the inter-city transportation market already is served by self-sustaining (profitable) air and surface operators. High speed rail is not commercial in the United States for a variety of reasons, among them the country's relatively low population densities, relatively high access to automobiles, and competitive (deregulated) air transportation market, which is capable of price discounting that renders high speed rail uncompetitive. As a result, a number of privately financed high speed rail proposals have failed, and the federal government is not likely to improve on this record.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Eliminate all Amtrak funding (including operating and capital support, the Northeast Corridor improvement program, and Penn Station). Management should be encouraged to develop creative solutions for survival.
<p>
<li>Repeal the National Railroad Passenger Act and the Rail Passenger Service Act. This, among other things, would terminate Amtrak's statutory monopoly (45 USC 541).
<p>
<li>Pre-authorize, in legislation, an interstate compact among northeastern states and the District of Columbia for the purpose of facilitating Northeast Corridor rail transportation in the event that citizens of these states are willing to subsidize the service.
<p>
<li>Repeal Amtrak's labor protections. Workers today can receive up to six years severance pay and enjoy numerous other protections and privileges because of costly work rules.
<p>
<li>Repeal the high speed rail program (49 USC Chapter 22).
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with an annual budget of $8.4 billion and 49,000 employees, manages the nation's civilian air traffic control system, promotes air transport safety, and assists in the financing of airport improvements. Approximately three-quarters of its personnel are involved directly with the air traffic control system,<b>28</b> composed largely of the operations of airport control towers, which guide aircraft through landings and takeoffs, and twenty en route centers, which manage the flow of air traffic between airports in the system. The FAA has broad responsibility for regulating air transportation and managing the nation's airways, in addition to such safety-related duties as aircraft certification, airport security, maintenance inspection, and pilot licensing.
<p>
The FAA's programs are funded through a combination of general revenues and the Aviation Trust Fund, itself financed by a series of user fees and dedicated taxes related to system usage. In 1995 these user fees and special taxes totaled over $6 billion. They were derived chiefly from the passenger ticket tax ($4,829 million), the waybill tax ($325 million), the fuel tax ($195 million), and interest on the trust fund ($809 million). At the beginning of 1995, the trust fund account had accumulated to $12.3 billion.<b>29</b>
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Air Traffic Control Responsibilities</b><br>
Although the FAA's air traffic control (ATC) system has helped provide the American traveler with one of the safest forms of transportation, shifting the system to the private sector would give it the flexibility and resources needed to speed modernization, enhance operating efficiency, and better manage and retain its many employees. The ATC system's efforts to improve and modernize operations have suffered from the bureaucratic idiosyncrasies of the federal procurement process, the civil service code, and congressional and executive branch meddling. One former FAA Commissioner noted that congressional committees had mandated the installation of thirty pieces of equipment neither authorized by Congress nor requested by the FAA. At the same time, rigid government pay scales have limited the FAA's ability to attract experienced professionals to high-cost, high-stress urban air traffic control facilities.<b>30</b>
<p>
<b>Faster Modernization.</b> The ATC's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar modernization program is a costly failure. As a result, the system remains one of the world's largest users of vacuum tubes, some of which are available only through formerly East Bloc countries.<b>31</b> Freed from oppressive government procurement procedures, a privatized corporation could speed the modernization of the air traffic control system by drawing on private capital. This would reduce costs by raising worker productivity; improving passenger safety through better and more accurate controls; diminishing weather-related cancellations, delays, and safety risks; and allowing more intensive use of existing airports, thereby cutting future infrastructure costs.
<p>
At the same time, automation of the many ATC functions that would be triggered by privatization would quickly turn an existing liability into an asset. Dependent upon the obsolete, high-maintenance, and labor-intensive technologies of the past, today's air traffic control system confronts a serious shortage of skilled personnel as an aging workforce becomes eligible for retirement. With the adoption of advanced technologies that allow a few to do the work of many, and that also require less maintenance, the prospect of significant retirements over the near term would allow for the orderly and costless downsizing of FAA's substantial workforce. 
<p>
<b>Budgetary Savings.</b> Although the ATC system relies heavily on user fees, general revenues still supplement its budget. An internal DOT study in 1994 concluded that converting the FAA's ATC component into a self-sufficient, independent government corporation could lead to savings of $18 billion, or approximately $2 billion per year, from 1996 to 2005.<b>32</b> As a quasi-government entity, this corporatized system would continue to rely on the passenger ticket tax as the chief source of ATC funding, but the general revenues that now fund a portion of FAA/ATC operations would be cut off. To compensate for this loss, the system would be permitted to borrow in capital markets on its own account to fund long-term investments and modernization. The FAA's safety and regulatory functions would remain within the federal government as part of a much smaller FAA, whose role would be largely one of system oversight, a legitimate federal function that would improve in quality as the government concentrated its energies and resources on a limited number of activities. 
<p>
While the Clinton Administration's plan for the ATC system is bold and innovative by past federal reform standards, opportunities for even greater reform exist in today's political climate. These should be pursued, as they are now in other industrialized countries. At present, the air traffic control systems in Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are corporatizing, privatizing, or actively considering one of these options. 
<p>
To privatize the ATC system, Congress should use as its model the proposal developed by Robert Poole of the Reason Foundation in a series of reports and publications dating back to 1982.<b>33</b>
<p>
<b>Privatizing the ATC System</b><br> 
The first step would be to reorganize the FAA by creating, as an independent government corporation, a U.S. Airways Corporation (USAC) and transfering to it all current ATC-related FAA staff (about 40,000), all FAA facilities and equipment used to operate the ATC system, and all ATC responsibilities now held by the FAA. During the reorganization period, and until the new corporation was established and operating successfully, all of its shares would be held by the U.S. Treasury on behalf of the federal government. Also as part of the reorganization, consideration should be given to creating several new air traffic control companies to ensure post-government competition. Half the towers could go into one, and half to another (the same would be true for the en route centers). Once privatized, they would be free to compete for business.
<p>
After the transition, the shares would be sold to the public, with special allowances for concessionary purchases by existing employees and managers. Within the portion of shares available to the public, a sub-portion could be set aside for purchase by firms and industries heavily dependent upon the USAC's services, such as the major airlines or associations representing general aviation, international aviation, passengers, overnight package delivery, and general cargo. 
<p>
Once established, the USAC would operate on a self-supporting basis and would be authorized to borrow for major capital expenditures, modernization, and other improvements. In contrast to the Clinton Administration's proposal to continue funding a restructured ATC through the existing passenger ticket tax, the private USAC would be funded by a direct user fee levied on the aircraft according to their utilization of the services provided by the system. As Poole has observed, the "daunting challenge facing ATC spin-off proposals is developing a user fee structure that is politically feasible yet fully funds the corporation"<b>34</b> and which also avoids the cross-subsidies inherent in the current system.
<p>
These cross-subsidies are considerable. For example, whereas passenger ticket taxes collected through the airlines account for 88 percent of the current system's revenues, airlines utilize 49 percent of its en route services and just 20 percent of the tower services. In contrast, general aviation provides just three percent of the revenues but accounts for 21 percent of en route costs and 60 percent of tower costs.<b>35</b> At the same time, government flights, chiefly military, utilize some ATC system services, but pay no direct, indirect, or other fees, although the military air traffic controllers provide some services to civilian aircraft, also at no charge.
<p>
In developing a new fee/price structure for the USAC, Poole recommends three general guiding principles:
<p>
<li>No one should pay for services they do not use;
<p>
<li>Non-commercial ("true" general aviation) customers should pay only the marginal costs they impose on the system; and
<p>
<li>Charges should be based upon long-run economic costs. 
<p>
A fourth principle should be added to Poole's list, based on prevailing views within Congress:
<p>
<li>Military (government) flights should not incur direct charges for utilization of USAC services, but the USAC -- through an annual appropriation from general government revenues  -- should be compensated for costs incurred.
<p>
<b>Fees That Are Fair.</b> Poole proposes a fee structure based on the technique of marginal cost pricing that utilizes the earlier pioneering analysis of Richard Golaszewski.<b>36</b> Golaszewski established marginal cost estimates for each of the four major user groups (airlines, commuters, general aviation, and military) for each of the key air traffic control services (air traffic control centers, flight service stations, terminal radar control facilities, and air traffic control twoers) and then allocated to each group their estimated share of fixed costs and other overhead.<b>37</b> Poole modifies these cost estimates by inflating the original 1985 estimates to 1991 levels and by reducing non-commercial general aviation's share of the costs to direct marginal costs actually incurred. Congress should further modify the Golaszewski/Poole proposal by deleting fees charged to the military and instead covering such costs incurred by the USAC on behalf of the military (which would have amounted to $8.3 million in 1990) out of general government revenues. 
<p>
With this modification, a new fee structure that meets the four principles above and covers all costs of operating the USAC would be approximately like that indicated in the table on the previous page. This table provides the specific fee per aircraft for each service incurred for each of the four main categories of civilian aviation.
<p>
<b>Savings for Passengers and Airlines.</b> The benefits of a privatized ATC system, stimulated by the profit incentive and free to pursue modern and innovative solutions to air traffic control problems, would be substantial. One airline estimates that a satellite-based air traffic control system modeled after the military's Global Positioning System would allow for precision approaches to airports and could save the airline industry $525 million per year through delay reduction, direct flight routing, and other improvements. Other analyses put the range of savings from ATC improvements in the range of $300 million to $1.5 billion per year.<b>38</b> As noted earlier, even greater savings would accrue to the taxpayer. Both DOT and the Senate Budget Committee project annual federal budget reductions of as much as $2 billion per year from corporatizing or privatizing FAA's ATC functions, largely by shifting the funding of its capital requirements from the taxpayer to the credit markets where it more logically belongs.
<p>
Management efficiencies and service improvements would follow from the USAC's ability to escape current civil service restrictions that make it difficult to fill key positions in high-cost areas because of pay caps and national pay scales. Under the current system, key towers and control facilities in such critical places as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles frequently are understaffed because of an uncompetitive pay scale. Similarly, the end of civil service constraints would allow the hiring of more professional managers with the business skills and experience to implement a comprehensive overhaul of the system.
<p>
Most important, freedom from congressional meddling and second-guessing and an end to federal procurement requirements and red tape would allow for swift implementation of a badly needed, but oft-delayed and error-plagued, technological upgrade of the system.
<p>
<b>Taking Care of the Work Force.</b> Obviously, a restructuring involving nearly 50,000 employees entails substantial and complicated transition issues, including labor contracts and explicit and implicit employment commitments. To ease the transition and reduce employees' uncertainty regarding their treatment, a formal commitment could be made to entitle the transferred workforce to civil service retirement system benefits already earned. This commitment could be financed out of general government revenues in the same way that earned worker health and retirement benefits were maintained when the post office became an independent government corporation in 1970. Alternatively, interest earnings on -- and, if necessary, the surplus in -- the Aviation Trust Fund could be used to cover the unfunded liabilities in the civil service retirement obligations for employees transferred to the USAC. For all workers hired after the formation of the USAC, a new pension system would be established that is fully funded and consistent with private-sector norms.
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Flight Safety Responsibilities</b><br>
All existing FAA air transport safety, licensing, and certification functions would be transferred to a new independent transportation safety agency, the Interstate Transportation Safety Office or Administration (ITSO), as discussed earlier. This new entity could be funded from general revenues or from a portion of existing waybill and fuel taxes. At present, the FAA has primary safety rule-making authority, which includes certificating aircraft and developing and enforcing operating rules and procedures. Other safety functions include pilot and mechanic licensing, accident investigation, airport safety, safety analysis, and information.
<p>
ITSO would be responsible for continuing the safety-related duties now performed by the FAA and by the other transportation safety-related divisions within DOT and elsewhere. Under the current organizational arrangement, portions of these functions are located in the FAA's Regulation and Organizational Analysis Division, Regulations and Standards Training Division, Airport Safety and Operations Division, Office of Aviation Systems Standards, Civilian Aviation Security, and the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification. All of these functions and staff would be transferred to the Aviation Safety Division of the new ITSO. Funding for the aviation division of ITSO could come from the existing freight waybill tax, fuel tax, international departure tax, and interest earnings on the trust fund. DOT's 1994 "Air Traffic Control:  Analysis of Illustrative Corporate Financial Scenarios" estimates that the FAA's safety duties cost $700 million in FY 1993.
<p>
<b>Better Safety.</b> Although the FAA has an excellent reputation for overseeing one of the safest air transport systems in the world, there is always room for improvement. The proposed restructuring could help facilitate this for several reasons. First, undistracted by its commercial-type ATC functions, an independent flight safety component could devote all of its attention and energy to promoting safety. Second, and related to this, those responsible for maintaining safety no longer would have to make the compromises necessary in an entity with multiple, and at times conflicting, objectives. As the operator of the ATC system, FAA essentially regulates itself and is required to make tradeoffs in trying to promote both safety and the health of the U.S. aviation industry.
<p>
<b>Airports and the Airport Improvement Program</b><br>
Funded from the Aviation Trust Fund through a portion of the passenger ticket tax and other dedicated taxes, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants to eligible airports for certain infrastructure projects. The federal government owns no civilian airports, except for Dulles and National, both of which serve Washington, D.C., and are now operated under long-term lease to a regional authority. Of the nation's 17,000 civilian airports, 13,000 are privately owned (mostly small and serving non-commercial general aviation primarily). The other 4,000 are owned by local governments or regional public airport authorities. Within these 4,000 are all of the airports served by the commercial airline industry as well as all of the hubs, both minor and major. 
<p>
In any given year, the AIP provides just a fraction of the funding for eligible airport improvement projects, with the largest and busiest airports receiving the smallest cash return relative to passenger ticket taxes paid. A 1990 analysis found that major airports at Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, and San Francisco received in annual entitlement grants less than 12 percent of the amount they contributed to the Aviation Trust Fund in ticket taxes. Meanwhile other airports (including, for example, such smaller airports as Charlotte, Dallas, Love Field, and Memphis) each received more than 30 percent of their contribution.<b>39</b> (Because the passenger ticket tax also partly funds the FAA's air traffic control and safety responsibilities, AIP grant returns will always be well below 100 percent of ticket tax revenues.)
<p>
<b>Costly Mandates.</b> As with urban mass transit and the Highway Trust Fund, the regulations and mandates attached to federal airport grant money may be more costly than the value of the grant because they constrain an airport's ability to tailor its services to the specific needs of its community and diminish its incentive and ability to become financially more self-sufficient. In return for accepting these funds, airports must agree to a number of federal regulations, including how and how much they charge for landing fees, caps on passenger fees, and limits on the utilization of surplus revenues earned on airport operations, as well as numerous other revenue and spending restrictions.
<p>
For example, federal law requires that airports charge landing fees based on weight of the aircraft, even though small planes take as much time and runway space to land as large planes. This leads to overuse of scarce airport resources by planes carrying only a few passengers. Peak load pricing for landing fees is also prohibited, thereby removing any direct financial incentive for passengers, aircraft, and airlines to schedule flights at less congested times, and for passengers to be charged accordingly. Likewise, the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act prohibits airports from charging passengers a use fee of more than $1, $2, or $3 per passenger and limits how these revenues may be used. In a number of cases, the FAA has forbidden airports from applying such funds to improvements in surface transit access that could alleviate vehicular congestion and delays. And sections of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 prohibit federally funded airports from using any profits generated at the airport for non-airport purposes, thereby discouraging cities and communities from fully developing the economic potential of their airports.<b>40</b>
<p>
Because of the many onerous strings attached to federal grants, many airport managers have concluded that they would be better off without this assistance. A 1987 DOT poll of operators of hub airports found that the majority of large, medium, and small hub operators would be willing to give up federal financial assistance, including airport improvement grants, in return for the elimination of the numerous federal restrictions on their operations and the freedom to set their own fees on airport users.<b>41</b>
<p>
The airport grant program should be terminated along with the FAA's passenger ticket tax, a portion of which funds AIP grants from the trust fund. At the same time, all the needless federal restrictions and prohibitions on airport fees, revenues, and profits should be struck from the law. Airports should be free to fund their operations and their expansion and improvement programs with financial resources derived from their own choice of fees, rents, taxes, or other measures. With no limits on profits or what can be done with them, airports would have an incentive to develop their facilities more intensively with rent-paying hotels, restaurants, parking facilities, retail stores, offices, and other businesses that would pay a premium to be either at or near an airport. 
<p>
Airports also could alter their landing fee structure by raising fees at peak times -- early morning and late afternoon -- and lowering them at off-peak times to encourage airlines to shift flights to less congested periods. Similarly, they could reimpose some form of a ticket tax, or head tax, but at well below current rates. Whatever the choice, the source and amount of the replacement revenues would conform more closely to the specific needs of a particular airport, as well as the passengers and airlines it serves. At the same time, improvement projects at any airport would occur when it chose, not when officials in Washington finally approve and schedule the project. 
<p>
To accomplish this, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act must be amended substantially, and the remaining portions of these laws limited largely to legitimate safety issues and <i>bona fide</i> issues of interstate commerce. These legislative changes would better facilitate airport privatization at the discretion of existing airport owners (primarily state and local governments), or regional authorities established on their behalf. Currently, such privatizations are authorized, albeit on a restrictive basis, by Executive Order 12803, issued by President George Bush on April 30, 1992, and implicitly endorsed by the Clinton Administration, which issued Executive Order 12983 on January 6, 1994, to clarify federal law facilitating such privatizations. These orders, and FAA's narrow and limiting interpretation of them, should be reviewed and changed as necessary to reflect the broader privatization options that would be available under the above proposals.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Transform the Air Traffic Control system into an independent corporation. This could be either government or private, funded entirely by direct user fees.
<p>
<li>Transfer FAA safety responsibilities to a new federal safety department.
<p>
<li>"Defederalize" airports by freeing them from non-safety-related regulations as well as financial support from the Airport Improvement Program.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE COAST GUARD</b><br>
With an annual budget of approximately $3.7 billion, the Coast Guard (CG) performs a variety of services, including coastal law enforcement and national defense, marine safety, environmental protection, search and rescue, and navigation and waterway management (traffic management, ice breaking, and maintenance of navigational aids).
<p>
Given the large changes in its objectives over the past several decades in response to the rapid increase in drug smuggling, the Coast Guard and its law enforcement and defense functions should be transferred to the Department of Justice to permit better coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies and activities. Related Coast Guard functions also should be transferred to Justice. These include the Office of Command, Control and Communications; Office of Engineering, Logistics and Development (ELD); Office of Personnel and Training; Office of Readiness and Reserve; and Military Personnel Command. ELD would be given more of an oversight function, with much of the work now done in house performed by the private sector on a contract basis.
<p>
With its focus now primarily on law enforcement, the Coast Guard's search and rescue duties should be limited to extreme emergencies and severe weather. Routine rescues and assistance to recreational and commercial boaters would become the responsibility of the more than 200 existing private rescue services that handled more than 40,000 cases last year. Among other savings, this should allow for a significant reduction in the number of Coast Guard air and sea facilities, including the 185 small boat units now maintained by the Coast Guard, as recommended by the General Accounting Office.<b>42</b>
<p>
The Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection should be split among existing government departments. Environmental responsibilities should be shifted to the EPA, and oversight for marine safety matters should be transferred to the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office. The Coast Guard already is using the private sector for some licensing and inspection, and this should be accelerated. Merchant vessel regulatory issues other than safety or environment should remain within the divisions transferred to Justice.
<p>
Waterway navigation, maintenance, and safety responsibilities of the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services that are purely local or regional in scope -- rivers, bays, ports, and harbors -- should become the responsibility of contiguous states. Those of an unambiguous national nature would remain with the Coast Guard as reconstituted within the Department of Justice. Many of these functions could be privatized easily. GAO, for example, has recommended the VTS 2000 system now under development as a candidate for privatization. The Port of Los Angeles VTS system already has been privatized.
<p>
<br>
<b>The Maritime Administration (MARAD)</b><br>
The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to ensure that the United States maintained a domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency. Organized as an agency within the Department of Transportation, it spends nearly $700 million a year implementing a series of Depression-era maritime laws that shield U.S.-flagged vessels from foreign competition. 
<p>
MARAD's Operating Differential direct subsidy program pays U.S.-flag vessel operators the difference between the costs of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flagged vessel and the costs of shipping on a foreign-flagged vessel. The Ocean Freight Differential program (authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985) subsidizes a portion of the cargo preference costs on agricultural food aid shipments for commodities exported with grants or loans from the Department of Agriculture. Cargo preference laws require that 75 percent of such exports be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The Jones Act, authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires that cargo transported between two U.S. cities be carried on U.S.-built and U.S.-flagged vessels. MARAD also maintains the merchant ships retained in the Defense Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be closed down, and the Operating Differential Subsidies, Cargo Preference rules, and Jones Act should be repealed. The government-owned merchant ships in the Ready Reserve Fleet should be sold and the Federal Ship Financing and Maritime Guaranteed Loan programs ended.
<p>
For over sixty years, the federal government has spent billions on a variety of programs intended to support the U.S. maritime industry. Instead, these programs have undermined the competitiveness of U.S. shipping and shipbuilding. Today, only about four percent of waterborne cargoes imported and exported from the United States are carried on U.S.-flag carriers. According to the GAO, between 1982 and 1992 the number of U.S. privately owned ships decreased by 31.4 percent, from 574 to 394.<b>43</b>
<p>
The Maritime Administration pays over $200 million in direct Operating Differential subsidies to 48 oceangoing container ships and 27 bulk cargo vessels. Most of these subsidy contracts are due to expire by the end of 1997. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget requested a reduction to $154 million. However, the Administration also would create a new Maritime Security Program which would give $100 million per year in direct payments to up to fifty U.S. flagged vessels for a period of ten years. This proposal should be rejected.
<p>
In 1994, the GAO reported that "the application of cargo preference to food aid programs does not significantly contribute to meeting the intended objectives of helping to maintain U.S.-flag ships as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency or for purposes of domestic or foreign commerce."  The GAO found that by sheltering U.S. shippers from competition, "cargo preference laws make it possible for U.S. ship owners to maintain inefficient and commercially uncompetitive U.S.-flag ships that do not significantly contribute to the ability of the U.S. merchant marine to carry foreign commerce other than food aid."<b>44</b>
<p>
MARAD's Ocean Freight Differential program spends over $60 million a year reimbursing the higher costs paid by the Department of Agriculture to export domestic agricultural products. These cargo preference requirements, as they are known, also increase by some $520 million annually the shipping costs for the Departments of Transportation and Defense, the Agency for International Development, and the Export-Import Bank. The Maritime Administration does not reimburse these agencies for these added costs. Meanwhile, Jones Act restrictions on inter-city cargo transport cost consumers billions of dollars but do not show up on the federal budget. According to a September 1994 study by the International Trade Commission, the Jones Act increases costs to American consumers by at least $3 billion annually, and perhaps by as much as $10 billion.
<p>
The Maritime Administration spent $330 million in fiscal 1994 and $205 million in fiscal 1995 maintaining the fleet of government-owned merchant ships known as the Ready Reserve Force. By all accounts, these vessels are in such a state of disrepair that only a few could be made seaworthy in time to carry cargo for the Persian Gulf War. These ships should be sold for whatever the government can get for them.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Shut down the Maritime Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the Operating Differential Subsidies, the Cargo Preference Rules, and the Jones Act.
<p>
<li>Privatize the Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
<li>Terminate the Federal Ship Financing Program and the guaranteed loan program.

<hr><h2>Drivers Could Get Speedy Win in Congress</h2>
<br>By<br> <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner</a></center><hr>
<p>
	Congress may soon liberate millions of American drivers who are tired of creeping along at 55 mph on roads designed for 65 mph or more.
	<p>Despite continued whining by self-appointed &quot;safety advocates&quot; that higher speeds will increase the carnage on U.S. highways, a measure already has passed the Senate to repeal the National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL), a bureaucratic nightmare that for years has made it illegal for drivers to exceed the &quot;double nickel&quot;, or 55 mph, anywhere in the country. 
<p>	The law, passed in 1974, deprived states of their historic right to set speed limits within their own borders, based on their particular needs and conditions. Especially upset were drivers in Nevada, which for years had no posted speed limit, and other Western states with thousands of miles of lonely roads connecting sparsely populated areas.
<p>	Hailed as a fuel-saving measure during the Carter administration's &quot;energy crisis,&quot; the double nickel should have died when President Reagan deregulated the energy industry in 1981 and the long lines disappeared at U.S. service stations.
<p>	Faced with the loss of some of their powers, federal transportation bureaucrats changed tactics and decided that NMSL was really a highway safety measure. So Congress kept the double nickel. In the years following, America's drivers voted with their feet and made the double nickel one of the most widely ignored federal laws ever enacted.
<p>	Bowing to public demand, Congress grudgingly decided in 1987 to let states raise the limit to 65 mph  but only on rural interstates. Thousands more people would die because of the higher speed limit, the &quot;safety advocates&quot; predicted.
<p>	Today, as Congress considers repealing NMSL, we hear the same dire predictions. Richard Martinez, President Clinton's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration head, claims the double nickel saves lives, while Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety's Jacqueline Gillan predicts &quot;more than 5,000 additional deaths and millions more injuries on our highways.&quot;
<p>	Gillan's widely reported prediction shows how hocus-pocus statistics can be used to create unjustified public fears in order to protect the power and turf of entrenched Washington bureaucrats.
<p>	In fact, fewer people died on rural interstates after 1987 than before, according to Charles Lave, chairman of the University of California's economics department, in a study for the American Automobile Association's Traffic Safety Foundation and the University of California Transportation Center.
<p>	Adds Jim Baxter, president of the National Motorists Association: &quot;If you look at the 65 mph highways now, there are about 2,500 fatalities on them each year. There were about 2,700 each year before 65 mph. What Gillan is suggesting is that we will have a doubling or tripling of fatalities on those highways. That's just not going to happen.&quot;
<p>	Baxter cites a 1992 study for the U.S. Department of Transportation that found the accident rate went up 5.4 percent in places where speed limits were lowered and fell 6.7 percent where they were raised. &quot;We expect improved safety, not diminished safety&quot; if states set speed limits, he says.
<p>	If the House and Senate agree on repealing NMSL  and it is not vetoed by President Clinton  some states undoubtedly will raise their speed limits. Other states won't. In both cases, America's drivers will, for the first time in 20 years, be able to watch the road ahead for safety traps instead of radar traps.

&quot;Hello, Family Research Council?  I'm a producer
for the noon and 9 <i>News on 10 </i>- network affiliate and all
that - and I'm looking for a virgin.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A virgin?&quot;
<p>
&quot;Yes, we heard that you might know one, if you can believe
this - ah, one that's over 18 and, ah, never had any intercourse.
<p>
&quot;We like to do television on oddities.  You know the format,
satanist accountants and IRS audit trend lines...the missing link
in Manhattan...
<p>
 &quot;And we heard that there were actually people claiming to
be virgins.  We though that went out in 1952 with a woman in Montana
named Ethel.&quot;
<p>
 A lot of people are &quot;discovering&quot; virginity as the
new minority class, thanks to the efforts of people like Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her associates, who are working hard
to convince Americans that 80% of teens are actively engaged in
sex and pursuing many alternative lifestyles.
<p>
 In mid-April, the committee Schroeder controls in the House called
the federal government's response to rampant teen bed-hopping
a national tragedy. 
<p>
 But the tragedy is that sexual politics is big business in Washington.
<p>
 Schroeder's committee whipped up the 80% figure by adding 20-year-olds
into the mix. 
<p>
 In fact, a study by the Department of Health and Human Services
found that among girls under age 18, almost 65% were virgins.
 In ages 15-19 (a group said to be swarming to the bedroom), almost
50% were still waiting.
<p>
 But while the pro-abortion lobby's numbers are bad, their political
logic is good.  And it will cost taxpayers.  Financial self-interest
is one reason that groups like Planned Parenthood and their patron
saint of federal funding publish inflated numbers.  It's a simple
political formula:
<p>
 A + B = C.
<p>
If most kids have sex - A.<br>
And my programs deal with sexual issues - B.<br>
Then my program needs more tax dollars - C.<br>
<p>
 For all their alleged interest in health, abortion activists
and their business counterparts make hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from the government.
<p>
 Take Planned Parenthood, for example.  According to a 1990 report
in a philanthropic journal, $273 million of the group's $370 million
budget came from public sources.
<p>
 Logic would argue that it's in the abortion lobby's interest
to justify its existence to the governmental overseers who provide
over 70% of their budget.
<p>
 Schroeder's real interests can be clearly seen at budget time.
 In the last cycle, while $150 million went to Title X, the federal
government's contraceptive program, Schroeder fought to kill the
$7.8 million that went to Title XX.  Two-thirds of Title XX goes
to teen parenting and care programs, while the remainder goes
to the only abstinence-based sexual education program in 
the federal budget. 
<p>
 One would think Pat and Planned parenthood would talk constantly
about abstinence - the best way to avoid sexually transmitted
disease and pregnancy.  But if kids really &quot;just said no&quot;
to sex, their golden goose would be cooked.
<p>
 Every day, I talk with people amazed to discover that virgins
are alive and well in North America.  The vast majority of teen-agers
are waiting to have sexual intercourse.  And many others, after
limited experience, choose a lifestyle of abstinence.
<p>
 But don't be surprised that their stories go untold or run as
brief mention under oddities.  The real story behind sexual politics
can be found on an accountant's spread sheet.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	"Ideas have consequences." This simple truism became the battle cry of the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. But it was true long before Ronald Reagan's term in the White House, and it is no less true today. America still needs the ability to explain its policies and to educate people around the globe about American values and the principles of freedom. Because so many in the world yearn to enjoy the freedom which the United States represents, the world still needs desperately to hear America's voice. 
<p>
	Reconvening this week after the August recess, Members of Congress should remember that although ideas have consequences, they will be impotent and inconsequential if they cannot be heard in the global marketplace of ideas. Congress will soon complete work on appropriations bills that provide funds for foreign operations and international broadcasting. In its zeal to cut wasteful and unnecessary government spending, the Republican majority is poised to cripple the Voice of America, even though VOA is both America's primary means of conveying ideas and information overseas and a cost-effective and strategically effective component of U.S. foreign policy. 
<p>
	 The congressional raid on U.S. government international broadcasting is an unfortunate convergence between Members who believe foreign affairs accounts are politically attractive targets for budget slashing and the Clinton Administration, whose lack of a coherent foreign policy means, among other deficiencies, inadequate support for international broadcasting. As a result, the 104th Congress is about to reduce the Voice of America's budget by as much as $54 million, a small amount in terms of the federal budget, yet a cut which will have disproportionate, far-reaching consequences. It could silence America's most effective voice in the global marketplace of ideas, even though VOA's benefits -- potential and actual -- far exceed the modest amount in the Administration's FY 1996 budget request ($395 million).
<p>
	Before embarking upon a budget-cutting course that is penny-wise but pound-foolish, Congress needs to take a closer look at the vital role VOA plays in foreign policy and public diplomacy. Instead of subjecting VOA to a false economy, Congress should provide enough funds to ensure that it remains the nation's international broadcasting flagship.
<p>

<b>IDEAS FUEL DEMOCRACY AND FREE-MARKET REFORM</b>
<p>
Social scientists never tire of explaining that today is the Age of Information. Television is ubiquitous. The transistor has made cheap portable radios common even in the world's poorest nations. Multi-spectrum radio broadcasting, proliferating cable, satellite, and direct broadcast television, microwaves, computers and fax modems, and other means of high-speed transmission have linked the world as never before. In the modern world, information dissemination and content have become indispensable instruments of state power. 
<p>
	 Information is no longer neutral; it has "strategic" value, as recent history demonstrates. In the victory of America and the West over Soviet Communism, military power kept the "Evil Empire" contained. But it was ideas and information, not bombs and bullets, that ultimately brought the Soviet edifice crumbling down. 	
<p>
	 However, if it is technologically the Age of Information, politically it is the Age of Chaos. The end of the superpower condominium has unleashed potent new forces kept contained by 45 years of Cold War. Today sub-national, tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict are battering peace and stability in the world as new nations and new ideologies struggle to be born. In this dangerous and uncertain world the interests of the United States will be challenged in ways Americans cannot now imagine. The ability to convey ideas and information will remain a necessary component of American foreign policy. America must be able to shape the course of the world through a voice that encourages the forces of freedom and discredits the forces of oppression.
<p>
	Perhaps it is self-evident, but in this era of dramatic global change it bears repeating that human behavior is determined by what one believes. There is a flow to history and culture; and its wellspring is the inner life of the mind -- thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs, and the passions they engender. This is especially true of the corporate actions of men and women, such as political decisions. The results of their thoughts flow through their hands or from their tongues and into the external world. Why else do dictators expend such immense efforts to control the content and flow of information?. What is usually the first objective of a <i>coup d'etat</i>? The answer is obvious -- radio and television stations. 
<p>
	 It is important to remember that the VOA did not begin as a weapon of the Cold War or in response to Soviet Communism. It was launched in 1942 at the beginning of World War II to counter Nazi propaganda, to reassure America's allies, and to give hope to people struggling against tyranny. Today the Voice of America is the nation's sole worldwide broadcasting service, reaching 100 million regular listeners over a network of shortwave, AM, and FM stations in English and 46 other languages. During the Persian Gulf War, VOA was America's only means of rebutting Saddam Hussein's propaganda aimed at the people of Iraq and was a key voice in reaching the nations of the Allied coalition.
<p>
	 VOA told the peoples of Nazi-occupied Europe during the darkest days of World War II:. "The news may be good or bad. We will tell you the truth.". Today VOA still follows this mandate, as required under its Charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415), which obliges VOA to provide "a consistently reliable source of news and information" based on accuracy, balance, comprehensiveness, and objectivity.
<p>
	The accuracy and objectivity of America's radio voice are having a profound impact on nations emerging from 45 years behind the Iron Curtain. The Open Media Research Institute surveyed 400 leaders in government and politics, the military, religion, higher education, media, and private enterprise in the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic States, and in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. According to this survey approximately 18 percent of the elites of these nations are regular listeners to VOA programming. In the Baltics, over 40 percent of decision-makers interviewed were regular listeners. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still needed despite the new freedoms enjoyed by their own news media.1<p>	The importance of getting America's message to the elites of emerging nations simply cannot be overstated. President Lech Walesa of Poland and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic have publicly confirmed the role which America's international broadcasting, including the VOA, has played in building democracy in their countries. In Ukraine, VOA's "Window on America" is said to be the most popular radio program in the country.
<p>

	VOA's example of free, uncensored news and objective, balanced features encourages the development of a free press among the listening nations, even when the Voice presents a less than flattering portrait of America. The example is strengthened by VOA's policy of maintaining a clear distinction between editorials, which speak in the name of the U.S. government, and news programming. 
<p>

	 The Cold War with the Soviet Empire may be over, but a cold war of a global nature -- the struggle over which ideas legitimize human governance -- is not over. The ideals of representative and limited government, of free enterprise and free institutions, have prevailed for the time being over Marxism-Leninism in much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but by no means have they been accepted everywhere in the world. Most of the world's people still live under some sort of despotism or suffer from revolution and civil war.
<p>

	The VOA is America's force projection in this continuing global struggle between competing political principles and social values. The United States is under no obligation to convert the entire world to America's system of beliefs, but it is widely acknowledged that democratic nations are more peaceable and less likely to challenge U.S. interests than dictatorships. Both advocates of a foreign policy based on national self-interest and those who stress the moral component of foreign policy can support a vigorous, information-rich public diplomacy that makes the world friendlier and more compatible with American interests. As long as America can engage in this global cold war of ideas with information instead of military force, the struggle can remain "cold."
<p>

	Even the Kurds -- embattled on all sides and fighting among themselves -- believe the broadcast word is mightier than the sword in building an independent nation. Instead of using scarce resources to buy arms, Kurds are creating a London-based television service to beam Kurdish-language programming to Europe and the Middle East as a "better weapon to win a homeland" for their people.2 <p><b>INFORMATION AS A TOOL OF U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY </b><p>Today's world contains rogue states and hostile nations whose main weapon is the well-disseminated lie -- lies about America's goals, interests, methods. To perpetuate themselves, these hostile regimes depend on propaganda, first to control their own populations and then to justify aggression abroad. It is an essential feature of modern dictatorships, one which they have in common despite differences in geography and culture, to consolidate power by controlling public opinion without having to answer to any traditional consensus or transcendent definition of right and wrong. 
<p>

	 Many Russians now freed from the yoke of Communism have remarked that the most hated feature of the Soviet regime was not the possibility of arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag, but the pervasive falsehoods that touched every aspect of life and tainted everything they touched. This kind of morally inverted society built on propaganda can be altered only through rebuttal by trustworthy, countervailing information over time. The only antidote to falsehood is truth, but truth is impotent unless America has the means to convey it into the domain of the lie.
<p>

	Today the threat of Soviet Communism has receded, only to be replaced by a new threat. By now it is universally acknowledged that revolutionary Islam represents one of the main challenges to democracy and American interests in the world -- not Islam <i>per se</i>, but the revolutionary movement which draws legitimacy from a militant and politicized interpretation of Islamic theology. 
<p>

	 The vast majority of the world's Muslims are not part of radical movements. Indeed, the governments of moderate and friendly Muslim countries are the primary targets of Islamic radicals. Today revolutionary Islamic regimes have ample money and access to the latest information technology. In this global contest for hearts and minds, VOA is the most potent means America has to combat the rising tide of a revolutionary ideology in which Mohammed has replaced Marx. 
<p>

	 Muslim revolutionaries realize the value of information as a tool of their strategy. Radio Tehran broadcasts daily in 23 languages, in English and European languages as well as languages native to the Middle East and the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union. Significantly, Radio Tehran broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian to Bosnia, constantly reinforcing the theme throughout all of its coverage area that the United States is the faithless enemy of Islam and that America has imperialist designs on the Persian Gulf and the oil-rich Middle East. Though these charges are false, there are enough points of reference in the message to make it plausible to Tehran's audience and give the falsehood a political impact. 
<p>
	 VOA's daily presence through its Arabic and Farsi services is balancing the picture and countering Iran's daily radio diet of anti-Western propaganda. VOA's 100-kilowatt AM transmitter in Kuwait will be upgraded to begin transmitting next year at 600 kilowatts and will reach all of Iraq and most of Iran, where the Voice already has an 11 percent listenership. America's message to Iran also sustains hope among those who suffer persecution at the hands of the mullahs, like members of the Baha'i and Christian faiths. In this part of the world where America has had to fight to defend its vital interests, VOA gives an accurate picture of a free society which respects all religions and treats Islam respectfully, reporting, for example, that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States. 
<p>

	In the Balkans, VOA's shortwave and medium-wave AM stations around the periphery of the zone of conflict provide a thorough blanket of coverage. Broadcasting three hours a day in Serbian and one hour daily in Croatian, VOA is the largest international broadcaster in the region and enjoys a 32 percent listenership in Sarajevo. It also broadcasts in Albanian to Kosovo, another potential flashpoint in the Balkans. 
<p>

	The recent NATO air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia provoked bitter denunciations in Belgrade and in Serb-controlled Bosnia. In Moscow the NATO air campaign against Russia's traditional allies also prompted vocal condemnation. With their tight control of news media, Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb leaders stir up ethnic hatred and keep violent passions high. They black out all information about Serb atrocities and war crimes charges in the West. Disinformation and falsehoods are a major part of their overall strategy. Without the VOA there would be no voice explaining U.S. and Allied actions to the people most involved or rebutting the false charges the Serbs use to legitimize their aggression.
<p>

	VOA recently began a refugee hotline as part of the Serbo-Croatian service. It offers broadcast facilities to reach separated family members in the Balkans, who can call a VOA telephone number and leave a message on the Serbo-Croatian line. VOA then broadcasts the message to reach separated family members. Numerous families have been reunited through this service. 
<p>

	This is more than a humanitarian gesture, one whose exact value is impossible to quantify. If American soldiers ever have to enter Bosnia, for example, as part of a NATO operation to cover the withdrawal of the U.N. Protection Force, America may find out how much it is worth. It is conceivable that the goodwill engendered by this service will save American lives if that day does come.
<p>
	In another volatile region of the world, VOA is broadcasting in Korean to counter the propaganda of the Stalinist North on the Korean Peninsula. In China, VOA is America's link to the most populous nation in the world. China's emergence as a global power and America's relations with the Chinese will be among the defining issues in the 21st century and will affect the future structure of world politics. It is absolutely essential for the U.S. to maintain an active presence there. The audience for VOA's Mandarin service has grown to include 70 percent of China's college students since the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Such programs as the "Harry Wu Watch," after the arrest of the human rights activist, and "China Forum" generate more than 4,000 faxes and letters to VOA per month from Chinese listeners. 
<p>

	VOA's Tibetan service recently expanded its broadcasts from a half hour to two hours a day. It is the only independent news source for the Tibetan-speaking areas of the world. In fact, the communist regime in Beijing devotes considerable efforts to jamming the VOA's Chinese and Tibetan broadcasts. Devoting scarce resources to jamming attests eloquently to VOA's effectiveness.
<p>

	In Myanmar, better known as Burma, the democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently was freed by the ruling military junta after nearly six years of house arrest. The only reliable sources of this news were the VOA's Burmese language service and the BBC. 
<p>

<b>Surrogate Radios</b>
<p>

In evaluating the role of broadcasting in global strategy, it is important to distinguish between the VOA and the so-called surrogate radios -- Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia, and Radio Mart, which broadcasts to Cuba. The mission of the surrogate radio services is to tell listeners what is happening in their own country, to provide information which their own radios would provide if their countries were free. This difference in missions is a matter of U.S. law. The surrogates also have a vital mission, but they do not explain or defend U.S. government policy; nor do they present U.S. values and institutions. That mission is unique to VOA. 
<p>

	 Under the International Broadcasting Act of 1994, federal funding for RFE/RL will end after 1999. And when Fidel Castro's grip on his island prison ends, as it inevitably must, federal funding for the Office of Cuban Broadcasting and Radio Mart probably will end. But there still will be a need for VOA to perform its role as America's voice to the world. 
<p>

	 Ultimately, no information strategy can be a substitute for adequate military power. Force of arms will always be the final argument when nothing else suffices. But it is far better to shape the world's events in advance, if possible, through "soft" means like information. Using broadcasting successfully as a tool of global strategy can create conditions of friendship and convergence of interests that make conflict unnecessary and give America options other than the last resort of armed force. 
<p>


<b>MYTHS ABOUT THE VOA AND U.S. GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING</b>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. government's international broadcasting programs propagate five myths to justify public neglect of the VOA or reduction of its resources.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Myth #1: The VOA can be privatized.</b>
<p>
The VOA provides both a means of public diplomacy to promote America's values to the rest of the world and an official voice for the U.S. government to explain and defend its policies. In other words, VOA is an instrument of policy, not just a source of entertainment. Private entities simply cannot carry out this function. Moreover, the VOA's network of facilities is extensive, operating in many remote corners of the world. It is inconceivable that private operations would have the inclination, resources, expertise, or profit-making incentive to take over such an extensive network. In the 1980s the U.S. government invested heavily to upgrade the facilities for international broadcasting. It would be a waste of that investment to curtail VOA's scope just when the return on that investment is beginning to be realized.
<P>

<b><li>Myth #2:. We have CNN and do not need the VOA.</b>
<p>
CNN does not reach an audience as wide, diverse, and strategically targeted as VOA's --. in their own languages. CNN does not provide the same content or policy-significant information; nor does it adequately explain or defend the positions of the United States. In fact, CNN's popular "World Report" program actually does the reverse. Its correspondents feed policy-significant information from foreign governments to the U.S. and other audiences.
<p>
<li><b>Myth #3: The Cold War is over, so the VOA is unnecessary.</b>
<p>
Those who make this assertion have a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between VOA and the surrogate radios like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Mart, which are products of the Cold War. VOA is more necessary than ever to give America a voice in the highly competitive global marketplace where the struggle for democracy and freedom is still being waged. Other nations, many unfriendly to America, are speaking effectively into this marketplace. The revolutionary regime of Iran is a notable example. Why should America now choose not to engage in this vital war of ideas?
<p>

<li><b>Myth #4: Government broadcasting has plenty of fat; all government broadcasting should be cut.</b>
<p>
Since 1992 VOA has reduced its broadcast staff by 25 percent, cut direct broadcast hours from 1,080 to 850 hours weekly, abolished or converted numerous language services, eliminated 14 senior management positions, and cut 170 other line positions to meet mandated budget reductions. VOA is now at a core operating level. Any further cuts will force VOA to eliminate entire language services to critical world regions.
</ul><p>
It can be argued that the need for surrogate radios will diminish over time if and when democracy, accompanied by freedom of information, takes hold in existing dictatorships and formerly totalitarian countries. But VOA needs to stabilize at a funding level commensurate with its vital mission, and not be subjected to further cuts. As stated in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, "If Congress wants to cut federal broadcasting, the better target is domestic public TV, for which a multitude of commercial alternatives do exist."3 <p><b>EFFECTIVE BROADCASTING REQUIRES ADEQUATE FUNDS</b>
<p>
	The Administration's FY 1996 budget request for VOA is $395 million. But VOA faces a $10 million reduction from the 1996 request mandated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the State Department authorization bill. 
<p>
	The Foreign Relations Committee report accompanying the authorization bill acknowledges that budget authority for international broadcasting (not counting the separate radio facilities construction account) in the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 is 21 percent below the operating level in 1994 ($487 million). In other words, VOA already is operating at the margins because the agency chose to absorb past funding cuts by reducing staff and broadcast hours across the board in order to keep critical language services on the air. 
<p>
	If Senate appropriators agree to the $385 million recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee, VOA will have to reduce direct broadcasting from 850 to 715 hours per week, eliminate another four language services, and end all shortwave transmissions to Latin America.
<p>
	The situation on the House side is even more bleak. The House Appropriations Committee marked up its State Department appropriations bill before the August recess, providing $341 million, or $54 million below the FY 1996 budget request. The committee's report acknowledges that a cut of this magnitude "could mean a reduction of at least 400 personnel, and the possible cessation of broadcasting in as many as 20 languages. These reductions come on top of the major reorganization/downsizing that occurred because of the 1994 Act (the International Broadcasting Act of 1994), which has resulted in staffing reductions of 900 at RFE/RL and 350 at VOA."
<p>
	If outlays fall to this level, the VOA in effect will cease to be a global broadcaster. America's voice will fall silent in vital corners of the globe as VOA scales down to a narrow regional focus, like Radio Australia or Radio Netherlands. 
<p>
	A cut of this magnitude will allow only 535 hours of weekly broadcasting in about 20 languages, with greatly diminished English transmissions in three of six key global regions. VOA would lose about half of its estimated direct broadcast global audience. 
<p>
	As it completes work on the State Department appropriations bill, Congress should keep in mind that the Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget request for international broadcasting was inadequate from the start and represents a substantial cut from prior year operating levels. At a bare minimum, House and Senate appropriators should fund the VOA at the $385 million recommended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
VOA embodies the importance of democratic culture and shared values, not just raw economic interests or military power, as a basis for international relations. America has a natural advantage in promoting U.S. interests and values in the world, unlike dictatorships which have to lie, since most people aspire to the values America represents. 
<p>
	The importance of moral leadership in the world by precept, by reasoning, and by sharing information is vital. It enables America to shape the world without having to use heavy-handed, intrusive means. Broadcasting America's values and views to 100 million people in critical areas of the globe for $395 million per year is money well spent, and a bargain at the price. To cut VOA further is indeed, in the words of VOA Director Geoffrey Cowan, the unilateral disarmament of the Information Age.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>



<p>

<i>While the Congress is primarily responsible for national domestic policy, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and is chiefly responsible for America's foreign policy. Next year's presidential race is therefore an important opportunity for Americans to debate the direction of America's military and our country's role in the world. In late September,</i> <b>Policy Review</b> <i>asked eight leading conservatives to define the most important defense and foreign-policy issues of the 1996 elections.</i>
<p>
<b><a name="george></a>GEORGE WEIGEL</b>
<p>	The United States has not had a foreign policy since January 20, 1993. Before then, with the exception of the Gulf War, the foreign and defense policies of the Bush administration were geared not to shaping the post-Cold War future, but to managing the Cold War's endgame. The Republican president inaugurated on January 20, 1997, will thus have an immense responsibility: creating the first post-Cold War foreign policy worthy of the name.
<p>	If the candidates in the 1996 GOP presidential primaries could forge agreement on the following six points, presidential leadership in 1997 and beyond will prove much easier:
<p><ol>

	<li>The United States needs a foreign policy. With the end of the Cold War, time, energy, and resources can and must be directed toward reconstructing civil society in America. But disengagement is not an option for the world's leading democracy and leading military power. The proliferation of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, hostile ideologies, and international terrorism place America always at risk. The risks are manageable, but not unless they are acknowledged and dealt with.<p>
<li>The completion and preservation of freedom's victory in the Cold War requires the expansion of NATO before the end of the century. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia should be admitted as full members, and Ukraine and the Baltic states engaged in some form of associate membership en route to full participation. As even Strobe Talbott now concedes, NATO expansion is a mortal threat neither to Russia nor to the evolution of Russian democracy. An appropriate security relationship can be defined between the new NATO and the Russian Federation while the former democracy evolves. If the history of Europe in the 20th century teaches us anything, it is that an ounce of preventive diplomacy and collective security is worth a ton of terrible cure.
<P>

<li>Preventing the spread of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction ought to be one of the highest priorities of U.S. national-security policy. This means clamping down on regimes that import or export such weapons, as well as improving counter-terrorist measures. The new president should confer quietly with Congress and America's principal allies on the conditions under which preemptive military action will be used to counter weapons proliferation against rogue states or terrorist organizations. The president should appoint a national coordinator of counter-terrorism, and he should instruct the relevant intelligence agencies and the FBI that a coordinated counter-terrorism program is essential to national security and that institutional roadblocks put in its way will be swiftly removed. <p>
<li>The essential technological complement to an assertive policy of nonproliferation and counter-terrorism is missile defense. It is criminally irresponsible to deny the American people and America's allies the benefits of missile-defense systems just because of Cold War shibboleths. Early in his term, the new president, in consultation with the Congress, should announce America's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, while pledging to share appropriate defense technologies with its allies.
<p><li>For tens of millions of people around the world, the United States remains a beacon of freedom. U.S. human-rights policy must be reinvigorated, stressing the universality of such basic human rights as religious freedom, free speech, freedom of association, and freedom of the press. The United States should rebut the argument that these rights are "culturally conditioned," while making vigorous use of instruments like the National Endowment for Democracy to support proponents of freedom living in totalitarian and authoritarian societies. We should place special emphasis on aid to the democratic opposition in China and Cuba.
<p><li>On its 50th anniversary, the United Nations is in desperate straits. It has demonstrated its ineptitude at "peacekeeping" in Bosnia, its functional agencies (like the World Health Organization) are awash in corruption, and the "soft" side of the U.N. has become a hotbed of internationalized libertinism, as demonstrated by the 1994 (anti-) population conference in Cairo and the 1995 Beijing conference on women. The next administration should reform the U.N. and its functional agencies, while shunning wastes of time and energy like the Cairo and Beijing conferences and the 1995 Copenhagen "Social Summit." If, by the year 2000, the U.N. has not been dramatically cleaned up and slimmed down, another Republican administration should seriously consider withdrawing from an institution that, at present, hinders the pursuit of the very ends it was intended to serve.

<p>Any candidate worthy of consideration should begin by understanding and expressing that the peace and prosperity we enjoy were dearly bought with the blood of Americans on countless battlefields the world over. No nation has given more selflessly to the cause of liberty; no nation has ever had a people wiser in distinguishing among the nations of the world our natural friends, our inevitable enemies, and the barbarians to be left alone. Thanks to the sacrifices of American people, we can say today, as Abraham Lincoln said a century and a half ago, that "all the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth, our own excepted, could not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years."
<p>	So, candidates, begin with pride in your country and gratitude to its people. We are a great country and deserve a prominent place in world affairs. We must never diminish our strength and purpose, since as Charles de Gaulle used to jest, the future lasts a long time. Serious threats will surely arise; whether they prove deadly will depend on us. Americans can be defeated or our interests thwarted only if we lose our moral virtues, make foolish moves in the world, and neglect our military power. No government has ever matched the Clinton administration in these failings.
<p>	America's only glaring weakness over the past half-century has been leadership sometimes unworthy of the American people. The nation's "leadership class" -- high officials, professors, and heads of big corporations -- has committed America's youth, blood, and credit to wars it did not intend to win. Communism was here to stay, they thought, and even Republican stars such as Henry Kissinger counseled accommodation with it. They dreamed not of freedom's triumph but of convergence and accommodation to tyranny. They dreamed up the idiocy that America's safety depends on continued vulnerability to missile attack, a doctrine that still prevails in Washington. These opportunities to equivocate will come again.
<p>	Since President Bush's time, this leadership class has decided that political and military history has ended and that our real enemies are the French and Japanese who sell us cheese and cars at good prices.
<p>	First observation: Foreign policy does not exist in a vacuum; it must have military capability to protect and project it. Diplomacy without power is a prayer -- not to God, but to one's adversary, and its fulfillment depends on the mood and whim of the party prayed to. No nation can devise a military posture until it has defined its purpose through national interest. America, therefore, needs a new doctrine to replace Monroe and containment.
<p>Such a doctrine must acknowledge that America has legitimate interests. First is the defense of the homeland. 
<p>	Second, our economy depends on trade. We need access to our trading partners.
<p>	Third, we are a nation that values travelfor trade, scholarship, science, and pleasure. Americans abroad must have a nation behind them.
<p>	Lastly, America's interest in regional stability cannot be ignored. If America's presence and purpose in the world can be doubted, if we tolerate vacuums of power, they will be filled by others, and ultimately American blood will be spilled. In the past century, we have been called upon time and again to secure peace and liberty after our leaders thought the world no longer needed us.
<p>	Along with the doctrine we need common sense -- in both diplomacy and military policy. This means not squandering American generosity in petty ventures cooked up by the U.N.'s petty bureaucrats. While our leaders downsize the U.S. military and tergiversate with our commitments to traditional allies in Europe and the Pacific Rim, the future and vitality of those regions is being shaped by petty tyrants whose only asset is the willingness to make war. The administration treats military matters as a spectator sport. The foreign-policy establishment calls Americans' objections to such leadership by turns warmongering and isolationism. Our candidates should recognize these objections as wisdom.
<p>	Collective response is a contemporary stupidity. The U.N. cannot respond, nor can Europe nor NATO nor the Pacific nations, unless one of them is both willing and able to respond alone. Joiners follow leaders, but when joiners have no leaders, they have conferences.
<p>	As for Bosnia, the president and the supreme Allied commander in Europe should tell our allies to join us in giving Serbia an ultimatum to stop the Balkan war or else face a united declaration of war by NATO's 15 nations. Otherwise, America should quit NATO, lift the embargo, and arm the Bosnians. The continuing policy vacuum has sapped America's prestige abroad and fostered European excuses for death, destruction, and "ethnic cleansing" in their own backyard.
<p>	Lastly, America needs missile defenses. There can be no further excuses for inaction. Even Democrats say that nothing so threatens regions and continents as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. To the nuclear threat, we can now add chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton idiocy is to make us all equally vulnerable. America has the technology to protect Americans and American allies from missiles. What possible excuse can be offered for failure to act? Why should Americans or their allies be threatened and blackmailed because our leaders are hooked on treaties and invalid concepts further outmoded by recent events?
<p>	Respect for Americans, pride in our selfless achievements in this dark century, and confidence in our future are the basis of military and foreign policy. These Americans are a wise and brave lot, and they deserve both common sense and courage from their leaders.

<p>	In a time of great uncertainty about America's role in the world, it is not the details of America's foreign policy that trouble her citizens so much as the sense that the man in the White House doesn't know what he's doing. Republican candidates will be tempted to dwell on the Clinton administration's specific foreign-policy blunders. Some of this will, of course, be necessary and valuable. But the American people will not and should not be satisfied solely with an indictment of the president's actions. 
<p>	Clinton's main problem as commander in chief is that, like many American liberals, he is uncomfortable with America's power. This makes him uncertain about how to use it. And this uncertainty is the source of the administration's misguided foreign and defense policies. The 1996 election is a superb opportunity to craft an alternative vision of presidential leadership. Articulating this vision, rather than promising a specific blueprint, should be the focus of the presidential campaign.
<p>By seeking the U.N.'s blessing on the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf War, where U.S. interests were clearly at stake, President Bush showed that Washington was uncertain about its newly acquired status as sole superpower. Over the past three years, the Clinton administration has taken this precedent to extremes. It has subjected U.S. and NATO actions in Bosnia to U.N. approval, even where those actions directly risked the lives of troops from our major NATO allies. It has accommodated U.N.-instigated "nation-building" in Somalia, going well beyond the Bush administration's original humanitarian objectives. In an astounding abandonment of American prerogatives, Clinton sought U.N. approval of the occupation of Haiti last fall, but sought no such approval from Congress. 
<p>	Many Americans have passively accepted the notion, implicit in Clinton's approach, that actions taken in the name of the U.N. are morally purer than actions taken or led by the United States. A look at the source of U.N. power reveals the emptiness of this point of view. 
<p.	Whereas American decisions are shaped by Virginians, Texans, Rhode Islanders, and the free citizens of 47 other states, a majority of the nations represented at the U.N. have political and social structures that are, to one degree or another, undemocratic. Many have governments that abuse their citizens and threaten other nations. None of the representatives at the U.N., including our own, is freely elected. 
<p>	Presidential candidates need to articulate the argument in a straightforward way: American power is the greatest force for good in the material world, and that power is derived from our Constitution, not from the U.N. Charter. How can the decisions of the United Nations have greater moral authority than those taken by the U.S. Congress which, despite its flaws, embodies the most representative and accountable political system in the world? No president should feel guilty for using wisely American power derived from our constitutional system. 
<p>	As they make this argument, candidates must brace themselves for the inevitable charge of "isolationism." The use of this term, now being leveled against the administration's congressional critics, is meant to conjure up frightening images of the 1930s and the unchallenged rise of fascism. It fits neatly with the liberal view of the world, which sees our commitment to world leadership and our participation in the United Nations as one and the same. Much like the domestic debate over welfare, this worldview also equates our "compassion" for developing nations to the amount of foreign aid money we give away. 
<p>	The candidates must explain, in positive terms, America's deep involvement in world affairs, and how this has very little to do with either the United Nations or our foreign-aid program. The combined dollar value of our foreign-aid budget and our contribution to the U.N. amounts to a tiny fraction of our private-sector trade. And we should not forget that much of our $270 billion military budget goes to keep the peace around the world, which is in everyone's interest. 
<p>In a very imperfect world, our military and economic power is derived from the fairest, most humane system of government ever devised. This should be a source of tremendous confidence for a president, not confusion and embarrassment.
<p>As a trading partner, a military ally, and a beacon of democracy, the United States has a huge stake in world affairs. The successful candidate should affirm these roles and dispute any suggestion that our internationalism should be measured by the degree of our subservience to U.N. policies.

<p>Foreign policy without armed force is like sheet music without the orchestra. We must be concerned about the Big Questions, but we must not neglect what has been happening to the "orchestra." 
<p>General George C. Marshall once said, "The soldier's heart, the soldier's spirit, the soldier's soul are everything. Unless the soldier's soul sustains him, he cannot be relied on and will fail himself and his country in the end." Marshall understood the decisive military importance of the intangible moral factors. No doubt he knew Napoleon's dictum that "in warfare, the moral is to the material as three is to one." 
<p>	The Clinton administration appears bent on crippling the military's moral powers as well as its material strength. Though it's uncomfortable, Americans must face the fact that revolutionary social policies are undermining the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the forces. Political correctness is replacing military character.
<p>	Most uniformed people agree, but dare not say it openly. Thus the problem of women in combat roles or homosexuals in the ranks is compounded by an institutionalized lie necessary to inject social deconstruction into an unwilling organism. And it leaches away the ethic of honor and integrity that are the heart of an effective military. Junior ranks see their seniors denying what everybody knows and forcing others to lie. They see careers of fine officers ruined because they will not genuflect to falsehood. They see flag officers putting self-interest above the welfare of their people. The moral damage is potentially disastrous.
<p>	Since a soldier must be "obedient unto death," sending him into battle is a moral transaction. He must be certain his life will not be wasted because of moral blindness or character defects in his commander. If his leaders are contemptuous of his sacrifice -- as was the British commander who reportedly remarked in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in 1915, "Casualties? What do I care about casualties?" -- it breaks the vital link that enables him to do the bloody, terrifying work of grappling with and killing the enemy.
<p>	But mutual trust does not happen overnight. It takes attention and commitment. Commissioned and non-commissioned officers have to set good examples, displaying truthfulness and integrity as well as military competence. Any policy that undermines this process hurts national defense as surely as cutting the budget or canceling vital weapons programs. 
<p>	Liberals have a teleological compulsion to remake every institution in their own image, and politicize everything they touch. They love to get their hands on the military, largely because it is a command institution and can be reshaped with relative ease from the top down (just as the Left, which is antidemocratic despite its sanctimonious posturing, would like to do to our entire society). 
<p>	To be sure, most military men still cling to the martial virtues, the very antithesis of liberal enlightenment. The military may yet manage to remain resistant to alien transformation. But it may still be forced to undertake more "acceptable" missions, like nation-building and peacekeeping, even though the operations in Somalia and Haiti got men killed, hurt morale, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, without benefiting any vital national interest. Liberals hope thereby to drain away the ethos of the warrior and replace it with the ethos of the global welfare caseworker.
<p>	Social policy and defense policy intersect at this issue. It could unite conservatives concerned about national security with those worried about the moral health of the nation. But strangely, Republican presidential candidates haven't focused on it. They are missing a good bet. In 1993, Clinton's decision to open the services to homosexuals generated an unprecedented outpouring of opposition. That deep reservoir of concern about the welfare of the armed forces is still there, waiting to be tapped. 
<p>	Perhaps it is hard to believe that the force that triumphed so magnificently in the Persian Gulf War could ever lose its soul. After all, that extraordinary victory was due as much to superior motivation, morale, leadership, and training as it was to technological superiority. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to take these qualities for granted, for they require constant cultivation. Throughout history, complacency has always been the forerunner of military disaster. Because it occurs outside the material domain, damage to the military spirit can't be quantified. It is subtle, insidious, and generally not noticed until it is revealed in the unforgiving crucible of combat.
<p>	Every candidate who wants to become commander in chief had better make sure he will have reliable forces to carry out the nation's foreign policy and defend our vital interests. Otherwise he may one day find this now unmatched military instrument crumbling in his hands just when it is needed most.

<p>	In July 1992, members of the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces visited the carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, to hear what Navy men thought about the question of women in combat. In anticipation of the two-day field trip, the Kennedy's commanding officer recorded a videotape encouraging all crew members to express their opinions freely -- whether in favor or opposed --provided they were prepared to explain their rationale.
<p>	Since that time, a great deal has changed. Almost nothing remains of the laws and rules exempting women from service in or near the front lines, and candor about the consequences of unprecedented policy changes now in progress can end a military career.
<p>	The armed forces have become a prime venue for social experimentation because those most directly affected must follow orders, without visible dissent. Navy Secretary John Dalton's new policy regarding pregnant women on combat ships, for example, forbids "adverse comments" about deployability problems resulting from absences due to pregnancy.
<p>	At a time when international commitments are growing, defense budgets are shrinking, and the armed forces are carrying a heavy burden of social and cultural change, the next president must insist on complete information and objective evaluations throughout the chain of command. He must also be willing to reverse experimental policies that detract from morale, discipline, unit strength, and overall readiness.
<p>	A pro-defense administration should begin with sound priorities. Contrary to the notion that the volunteer force exists to provide job opportunities, the next president must recognize that the armed forces exist to defend the country, and the needs of the military must come first.
<p>	Technology and hardware are important, but money alone cannot buy a strong national defense. Wars are deterred, or fought, not by computers and weapons, but by people -- young men and women who volunteer to defend their country in a still-dangerous world, despite countless sacrifices and personal risk. To improve the recruitment and retention of qualified troops, we must avoid anything that makes military life more difficult or dangerous.
<p>	Current policies placing women in or near close combat units must be reevaluated -- not in terms of career opportunities, but in terms of military strength and readiness. Lives must not be sacrificed, nor missions undermined, because of front-line soldiers who are less strong, less deployable, and more vulnerable to wartime violence and capture. The definition of the word "qualified," as in "qualified to do the job," must not become flexible and therefore meaningless for the sake of women or any other favored group.
<p>	Affirmative-action quotas that subvert high training standards historically based on merit and wartime requirements should be ended by executive order. In the tradition of Harry Truman, who promoted social change by ending racial segregation in the armed forces, the next president should insist on policies that judge people as individuals, not as members of groups.
<p>	The next president must seek a more sensible balancebetween the interests of parents, field commanders, and children who stand to lose the most when their mothers are sent to fight a war. Overly generous pregnancy benefits offered without regard to marital status, for example, degrade cultural values while escalating family stress, child-care costs, and non-deployability numbers. Disciplinary problems must be addressed as well, since human emotions do not always respond to military orders.
<p>The Clinton administration has persisted in promoting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle, despite the law passed in 1993 intended to exclude homosexuals from the military. The next president should deny the gay agenda, which has gained significant ground in all branches of government, including the uniformed services.
<p>	Ronald Reagan, who enlisted but did not serve in the front lines, demonstrated that a pro-defense presidency does not depend on military background alone. In the tradition of Ronald Reagan, the next commander in chief must convey a deep respect for military values, and be willing to defend the interests of the troops against civilian activists with different agendas.
<p>	Clinton has tried to convey respect for the military by using soldiers, sailors, and aviators as backdrops for "photo ops." The next commander in chief must earn the respect of the troops by standing on principle, not public relations.

	The three most important foreign-policy and defense issues of the 1996 elections are America's vulnerability to nuclear missiles, foreign aid, and the extent of America's international engagement, including the use of force overseas.
<p>	    In a post-Cold War world, a nuclear attack against American territory poses the single gravest security challenge. Despite several strategic-arms control agreements signed over the last decade, Russia retains a large nuclear arsenal. China is also modernizing its nuclear forces. A number of other countries are aggressively developing small, but potent, nuclear forces.
<p>   America's failure to deploy ballistic-missile defenses doesn't just perpetuate our national vulnerability. It also greatly weakens our diplomatic prowess. Imagine how different the outcome of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait might have been if, just as the Bush administration was contemplating its options, Saddam Hussein had informed the world that he had already built a dozen or so nuclear-tipped ICBMs.
<p>	Contrary to the musings of traditional arms-control theorists, American ballistic-missile defense deployments are likely to discourage other countries from embarking on the path of nuclear proliferation. I suggest that the candidate inform the American public about our vulnerability to nuclear attack and explain the imperative, including costs, of appropriate solutions. I propose a measured missile-defense program that deploys "brilliant pebbles"-like weapons as its first phase.
<p>	The popularity of foreign aid with the American people has reached a nadir. Americans complain, correctly, that significant amounts of U.S. aid have been misdirected, and many object to providing any foreign assistance when we have urgent domestic problems. But foreign aid, if it advances specific U.S. national interests, can be a useful foreign policy investment. I recommend that the presidential candidate begin a candid dialogue with the American people about the merits of a judicious foreign-aid program. While streamilining our foreign aid delivery by merging AID into the state department and eliminating wasteful social and developmental programs, I would show how it serves America's interest to use foreign aid to promote democracy and free markets in other countries. Furthermore, U.S. aid should be provided directly to its intended recipients rather than funneled through international institutions.
<p>	Finally, the use of American troops in such places as Somalia and Haiti and the speculation that American ground forces may be sent into combat in the former Yugoslavia have reintensified the long-standing debate about the proper scope of America's international engagement and the role of force in support of our national interests.
<p>	Presented with these realities, I suggest reestablishing the basic public consensus on this critical national-security issue. The American people need to understand that we must remain a key international player and that our troops should be deployed for combat overseas only when vital American interests are at stake. Once deployed, our troops should be given all the resources they need to prevail in combat quickly and decisively. Nothing would be more harmful than the specter of American forces suffering casualties because they either lacked heavy armor (as in Mogadishu), could not engage in an air-defense suppression (as in Bosnia), or were commanded by bungling U.N. officials.

<p>
	There are two foreign and military policy issues that seem to me of greatest significance during the forthcoming campaign.
<p>	The first issue is missile defense. The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology can be slowed but not avoided, for primitive versions of the bomb and of delivery systems are, after all, 50-year-old technology. The bizarre theory of mutual assured destruction and the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty keep us defenseless against all logic, and the time has come to replace them with a policy of defending the country. The more plainly candidates speak about this, the more public support there will be.
<P>	The second issue is intervention: When do we risk the lives of our soldiers in crises overseas? This is obviously a complex issue and, with the Cold War over, many Americans (including some candidates) will be tempted to answer: "Never." I would like to see a candidate address this issue in more or less the following manner:<p><blockquote>
	"During the Cold War, we had to lead a coalition of nations against the twin threats of communism and Soviet power. We rose to that struggle and won it, and our victory saved our own freedom was well as the freedom of hundreds of millions of others.<p>
	"Now that it is over, we can do less and spend less overseas. There are places on the globe that simply don't matter enough to demand American involvement. But just as we had interests to defend before there was a Cold War, and just as there were threats to us before then, the same is true now.
<p>	"Some of these interests are very old: The first American statesmen saw what we had at stake in Mexico and the Caribbean; today, drug and migration flows are still major issues. Some interests are new: The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology now gives small nations and terrorist groups the ability to strike at America. But it is clear that a world in which every petty tyrant is armed to the teeth, and our foreign markets are in turmoil, and our own region is plagued by instability, will not be a very good gift to our children. America still has an irreplaceable role if the world is to be a less dangerous place.
<p>	"Why us? Because our wealth, power, and freedom grant us the leadership of the world's democracies. It is true that our power provides a continual temptation to meddle in situations where our interests do not require us to jump in, and one test of a president is to keep his cool and stay out of those.
<p>	"But if we are to keep the world moving toward freedom, and protect our freedom, safety, and prosperity, we cannot act as if we lived on some other planet. Another test of a president is to know when our interests really are at risk today, and the toughest test is to understand when they will be at risk tomorrow if we don't act now. We can pass those tests or fail them, but we cannot avoid them."</blockquote><p>

<p>	The overriding foreign-policy issue in the coming presidential campaign is the loss of the strong place America held in 1991the year of victory in the Persian Gulf War and the formal disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and the nation's progressive weakness in international affairs. Do the American people approve of this direction?<p>
	Presidential candidates would be wise to reject the conventional wisdom that Americans are uninterested in foreign policy, that their desire to address serious domestic problems comes at the expense of concerns about U.S. influence abroad. Voter confusion is understandable, since no national political leader has explained why Americans should be interested. The task of a challenger is to show plainly what a world bereft of American leadership looks like. This should be at the heart of any conservative presidential candidate's foreign-policy position.<p>
	At risk in Bosnia is America's historical commitment to the principle that employing force to seize another country is unacceptable. The current administration has effectively given the U.N. secretary-general veto power over the use of our forces in the Balkans. This failure has neutered U.S. policy there and promises to cripple it in the future.
<p>	Up to now, American weakness in Bosnia -- as evidenced by years of inaction, and demonstrably poor military advice -- 0has encouraged only one leader (Jacques Chirac of democratic France) to fill the void. But if this administration's incomprehensible Bosnia policy continues, it will eventually embolden some dangerous challenger armed with nuclear weapons. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia could also spread throughout the Balkans and beyond. Presidential candidates should remind voters of this century's brutal history and of America's immediate economic and security interest in maintaining a peaceful, prosperous Europe.
<p>	To underline the character of excessive multilateralism, the eventual challenger to Clinton in 1996 should use in a political advertisement the videotape of the U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi's press announcement on July 26. That's when he declared that "the secretary-general has decided to delegate the necessary authority [to conduct air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions] to commanders in the field." Insofar as Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali really holds the power to decide when American commanders may or may not use force, the challenger should make the current administration's responsibility for this plain. Voters will not be pleased.
<p>	America's gyrating policies in Asia for the past three years undermine this nation's general commitment to free trade, as well as its specific commercial and security ties to Japan and the future of its relationship with China. Asia has the fastest-growing economies in the world, and American exports there support more than three million jobs. Blown by domestic political winds, the current administration's policies in Asia have touched every point on the compass. Going to the brink of a trade war with Japan is, politically, perhaps unassailable. But if Japan is true to form, there will be no significant increases in imports of American auto parts by this time next year. 
<p>	The challenger should exploit this fact. He should call attention to the inconsistency between the administration's support for NAFTA and GATT, and its managed-trade policy towards Japan. He should also note that Japan is slowly becoming more democratic by itself, and that U.S. pressure for managed trade thwarts this evolution.
<p>	Finally, the candidate should demonstrate that he will take his responsibility as commander in chief seriously. A missile defense is only one thing that this administration is ignoring in order to keep the military as ready as it needed to be during the Cold War. America now has within its technological grasp the ability simultaneously to reduce defense spending and construct a military that can move swiftly to any part of the world, and from a safe distance wield decisive conventional power. This is the kind of force that we should be building, not a smaller version of the Cold War model. To achieve this, the defense department must shrink the huge and ungainly central bureaucracy it has developed over the years. The candidate will be on firm ground in arguing that the sound political principle of decentralization and returning authority to the states should apply equally to the wise management of the nation's defenses.
<p>	It has been years since a presidential candidate said anything about defense except that there should be more of it, or less of it. The candidate who breaks this pattern next year will add to his qualification as prospective commander in chief, and perform for the defense department a vital task that it may not be able to accomplish on its own.

<title>Missing: $13.5 Billion -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<center><h3><i>Missing: $13.5 Billion</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) wins my annual award for the most outrageous example of government bungling. If this isn't an example of why government should be entrusted with as little responsibility as possible, I don't know what is.
<p>
	A recently completed Inspector General's (IG) audit found that the department's Food and Consumer Services (FCS) division -- which is responsible for the school lunch and food stamp programs -- could not document what it did with $13.5 billion of the $36.7 billion it spent in 1994. That's right: 34 percent of what it spent was unaccounted for! Talk about waste, fraud and abuse!
<p>
	The auditors reported that at one point, when figures from the Treasury Department -- which writes the government's checks -- didn't match its own, FCS just "fudged" the numbers and forced a match. According to the IG, the employees made no effort to figure out why the discrepancies existed or what was done with the unaccounted-for money. In the private sector, this is called "fraud." 
<p>
	Even big-government liberals like Vice President Al Gore now agree that government is rife with waste and foolishness. For a good laugh -- rather, a good cry -- just read Gore's <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/npr/nptoc.html">"National Performance Review."</a> As I noted, the Agriculture Department is responsible for running two very costly and politically charged programs: school lunches and food stamps. These programs affect millions of American families and suck up billions of your tax dollars every year. And the bureaucrats responsible for running the programs don't even know where your money went!

<p>	Of course, the USDA bureaucrats have an excuse. They complain about a recent switch to a new automated bookkeeping system. In other words, everything was humming along just fine until somebody tried to make things work more efficiently.
<p>	Come on. Either Agriculture Department managers are incompetent and need to be replaced or the welfare state has grown so large that nobody can keep track of where our money is going.
<p>	
The so-called "War on Poverty" -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized school lunches, etc. -- has cost American taxpayers $5.4 trillion over the past 30 years. There really aren't enough "good intentions" in the world to justify spending that much money with basically no result. The percentage of Americans living in poverty is still around the same level it was in 1965, when the spending spree began. When something doesn't work, it should be fixed. Or gotten rid of.
<p>	Of course, conservatives like me are demonized when we suggest that the welfare state  undermines personal responsibility. Now, along comes this audit to suggest that welfare also affects the responsibility of the people running the system.
<p>
	Think about it. Wouldn't you get a little jaded about accountability after years of passing out billions of dollars for a system that doesn't work -- and the more it is seen as a failure, the more money you are given to pass out?
<p>
	It is probably a pretty safe bet that this particular agency is not unusual, that similar outrages would be found if the rest of the welfare system were audited.
<P>
	In fact, the auditors in this case had to give up before finishing because the bookkeeping was so sloppy. "We discontinued our review because we did not believe that we could complete our sample in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost," they said.
<P>
	At least someone was thinking of who was picking up the tab.

<h2>WHY "KING COTTON" IS TRASHING FARM REFORM</h2>
By John Frydenlund<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
9/21/95
<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	While most folks in Washington fled the summer heat and humidity for the August recess,  a little-known special interest stayed behind to plot strategy. And so far it's working like gangbusters.
<p>	The National Cotton Council of America lobbies on behalf of cotton producers, ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, cooperatives and manufacturers. During the recess, "King Cotton" declared war on Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And last week, it paid off.
<p>	The Council's efforts were instrumental in defeating in committee Roberts' attempt to end 60 years of failed New Deal agriculture policies. His farm-reform bill, the "Freedom to Farm Act of 1995," would have ended a special deal cotton producers enjoy. By allowing them to receive federal crop-support payments as three separate entities -- as individuals, corporations and partnerships, for example -- a mile-wide loophole in the current farm program lets cotton producers pull down two-and-a-half times the national average per-capita income. 
<p>	Roberts' plan was simple: Get the U.S. Department of Agriculture out of the business of deciding what farmers grow on their farms, and instead let individual farmers decide what they want to plant based on what they think they can grow profitably for markets around the world. The bill also would have eliminated the various government-reserve programs that encourage farmers to idle potentially productive farm land.
<P>	Of course, since the Roberts bill would have cut off the money spigot for the Cotton Council, an army of lobbyists descended on the capitol. The Council insisted that nothing less than keeping the status quo was "acceptable." In a recent "Action Request," the Council urged its members to tell their congressmen that Roberts' bill "abandons U.S. agriculture, will depress land values and will discourage new investment."
<p>	In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation estimates farmers would have actually gained more than $7 billion extra over seven years as a result of the Roberts bill than they would under the current farm program. This is because the Roberts plan would have provided generous transition payments to help farmers switch from the current system to a free market, and because of  increased sales as farmers were freed from federal limits on how much they can plant.
<p>	Of course, the battle isn't over -- the House Budget Committee may take up farm reform next. It's members should be interested in a report released earlier this year by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which characterized the cotton program as a costly, complex maze of domestic and international price supports that benefit a small group of wealthy cotton producers. Cost to the taxpayers: more than $12 billion since 1986.
<p>	A privileged 300 cotton producers received between $250,000 and $1 million apiece in taxpayer dollars in 1993, and about 2,000 got between $100,000 and $250,000, thanks to the cotton loophole, according to GAO. The rest of the cotton industry's 95,000 participants have little to show from this sweetheart deal with Washington.
<p>	In fact, if the majority of America's cotton farmers knew the truth, they would be outraged. It so happens that of the 35 board members who attended the Council's June meeting in Charlotte, N.C. --  the group pushing hardest for the status quo -- only five actually were cotton farmers. The rest were ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, heads of cooperatives, and manufacturers. In other words, 86 percent of the Cotton Council's top leaders don't even grow cotton. The processors and marketers who fill the majority of the board's seats want to keep nearly $1 billion in payments the Roberts bill would give to actual cotton growers to help them transition to a free market.<p>
	A simple question needs to be asked: Why does the government even have a price-support program for cotton at all? The argument typically put forward for having agricultural price-support programs is so that America will have "a stable food supply." But cotton isn't food. Besides, worldwide demand for cotton is at record levels. Cotton prices are higher than they have been at any time since the Civil War. 
<p>	Like so many government programs, the cotton subsidy, originally intended to help small farmers, has turned into another special-interest boondoggle. Pat Roberts took a courageous stand against corporate special interests who have wrapped themselves over the years in federal largesse, and lost. 
<p>	Now the House Republican leadership should give the Budget Committee a shot at deciding whether American farmers will be set free to compete in world markets, or stay chained to the special interests.

<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Congress is expected soon to consider legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the multilateral trade talks concluded successfully last
December. Among other provisions, the new pact for the first time
subjects trade in farm products to GATT's international trading rules.
(For a full discussion of the provisions of the Agriculture Agreement,
see Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.) 
<P>
     This means that U.S. farmers will face substantially lower trade
barriers when trying to export their products. Under the agreement,
the signatories agreed that all existing non-tariff barriers
(including import quotas) must be converted to tariffs, and every
agricultural product must be allowed at least some minimum level of
access to their domestic markets under low or minimal tariff rates.
Countries that export farm products will be required to reduce the
volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent and the amount of the
subsidy by 36 percent over six years. The agreement also calls for
reduction of all domestic agricultural subsidies (such as U.S. farm
subsidies) tied to production of commodities and significant reduction
of all existing direct agricultural export subsidies. (Specific
changes in U.S. law required by the GATT agreement will have to be
made in the implementing legislation. Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, which provides authority to impose quotas if imports
are undercutting price support programs, will be repealed and replaced
with authority for tariff rate quotas. The implementing legislation
similarly curtails restrictions on imported peanuts, in addition to
limiting subsidized exports of government-held dairy stocks and
repealing the Meat Import Act.)
<P>
     Along with the new regional market opened up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the prospect of expanding
free trade arrangements involving the United States, (See Michael G.
Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging a Free Trade Agreement with
Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991, June 27, 1994.)
ratification of GATT will open up a potential marketplace of six
billion customers for U.S. farmers -- compared with the U.S. domestic
market of only 250 million people. 
<P>
     The ability of American farmers to seize the opportunity provided
by this vast new market, however, will depend upon changes in U.S.
farm policy. America possesses the most productive land resources and
advanced agricultural infrastructure in the world, yet U.S. farmers
have been unable to capitalize on these advantages. Even though world
consumption of food and agricultural products has increased
substantially since 1981, U.S. agricultural exports have decreased
overall, and exports of unprocessed agricultural commodities have
fallen (see chart on page 3).
<P>
     One obstacle that must be removed if U.S. farmers are to take
advantage of GATT is supply-control policies, specifically the annual
acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP). These programs have removed on average over 15 percent of U.S.
acreage from production annually and thus limited the opportunity of
farmers to export. To appreciate what this means, it is as though
government policies had shut down 15 percent of the U.S. computer
industry while the international market for computers is booming.
Meanwhile, agricultural producers in the rest of the world have
increased their production to fill the void created by reduced U.S.
production. These foreign producers have sold their products at a
lower price, thereby making the United States the "residual supplier,"
or the last seller to be chosen in most markets.
<P>
     Another obstacle that stands in the way of farmers taking
advantage of GATT is the Export Enhancement Program (EEP), which
subsidizes the dumping of U.S. agricultural products on the world
market. Although EEP was intended to make U.S. farm products more
competitive, the program is counterproductive. In fact, U.S. export
subsidies depress world prices while domestic prices remain high,
creating a price differential that has made the United States an
importer of some agricultural products. (This was demonstrated earlier
this year when U.S. supply control programs contributed to a short
supply of durum wheat -- a specialty crop used in making pasta
products -- leading to increased imports of Canadian wheat in order to
supply U.S. pastamakers.)
<P>
     The United States has an opportunity to reverse these policies
and restore the competitive position of American agriculture when
Congress considers the 1995 farm bill. Because farm policy is
reauthorized only every four or five years in the farm bill, next
year's bill will be the first opportunity to revise these policies to
take advantage of GATT.
<P>
     For U.S. farmers to benefit from the world market opened up by
GATT, Congress needs to incorporate the following changes in farm
legislation: (Additional changes needed in U.S. agricultural policy
will be addressed in future papers.)
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction or set-aside programs.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program to include only highly
erodible acres.
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program.
<P>
     The U.S. policy of unilaterally idling massive land resources
already has led to a significant loss in America's share of the
expanding world market. This has shrunk farmers' ability to earn
income from the marketplace, held back the development of agribusiness
infrastructure, and caused economic problems for many rural areas. By
eliminating acreage reduction programs and modifying the Conservation
Reserve Program, Congress could make sure that U.S. agriculture once
again becomes the leading force in the world export market by enabling
U.S. farmers to take advantage of the promised benefits of GATT's
trade liberalization and reform. And by eliminating the Export
Enhancement Program, the U.S. will no longer be employing a trade-
distorting practice that actually undermines the potential of certain
export markets.
<P>
     The enormous export potential of American agriculture has been
held back for years by federal policies that largely ignore the huge
world market. GATT makes that world market potentially even larger and
attractive to U.S. farmers. If the 1995 farm bill revamps policies so
that farmers can make full use of agriculture's productive capacity to
compete in the world's market, U.S. farm income will increase and the
rural economy will receive an enormous boost, creating jobs, producing
greater prosperity, and reinvigorating distressed communities. But if
the farm programs are not revised, rural America will stagnate while
other countries exploit the new markets opened up by GATT.
<P>
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Implementing GATT will mark the beginning of a new era for world
agriculture and agricultural trade. Before the diplomatic breakthrough
which made the GATT agricultural agreement possible, trade
protectionism in agriculture was practiced throughout the world,
especially by such developed countries as the United States and the
nations of the European Union.
<P>
     This protectionism has not helped domestic producers, even in
developed countries. Explicit import restrictions, including quotas
and tariffs, and non-tariff trade barriers, such as unwarranted food
safety and quality regulations, merely have hindered the ability of
developing countries to penetrate the developed countries' markets. At
the same time, the United States and the European Union have been
waging a mutually destructive and trade-distorting bidding war, using
export subsidies to finance underpriced sales into the developing
countries. The costs of such distortions to agricultural production
and trade have been rising steadily while U.S. market share has
declined, as demonstrated in the chart on the preceeding page. The
GATT Uruguay Round agreement is significant because it reverses this
trend and reopens competition for markets based on productivity, not
protectionist policies.
<P>
     GATT will open up marketing opportunities for U.S. livestock
products throughout the world, including Japan and Europe (where
import barriers have been particularly restrictive). More
significantly, GATT will raise the incomes and standards of living in
the developing world because global economic expansion (the GATT
agreement is expected to expand the world economy by $6 trillion by
the turn of the century) will stimulate growth throughout the world.
This will lead in turn to more demand for higher-protein sources of
food. This trend is likely to be most pronounced in the fastest-
growing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where half the
population is under 15 years of age and the nutritional requirements
are greater than in older populations. By the end of this century, 60
percent of the world's population will be living in Asia, where
incomes are rising dramatically. And before the year 2050, it is
expected that world population will double and that, due to rising
standards of living, world food needs will triple. (Dennis T. Avery,
"Saving the Planet with High-Yield Farming," paper presented at The
Heritage Foundation's Agricultural Policy Roundtable, May 23, 1994.)  
<P>
     For U.S. farmers, this translates into an extraordinary
opportunity to increase the export of many agricultural commodities,
especially corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and livestock
products. There are also indirect opportunities due to a larger world
market. For instance, the new access into the fast-growing Asian
market for beef, pork, and poultry will mean increased domestic
consumption of grains by U.S. livestock. Thus, the U.S. grain sector
will benefit not only from direct sales of grain, but also from
greater sales of grain-fed livestock.
<P>
     Since U.S. agricultural productivity is rising faster than
domestic food demand, agriculture's well-being depends heavily on
international trade. If U.S. farmers manage to regain the competitive
edge internationally, the share of overall U.S. production going to
export will increase significantly; but if this historic opportunity
is lost because domestic farm policies hold back potential exports,
farming communities will suffer greatly.
<P>
     Existing U.S. agricultural policies already have hastened the
loss of much of the agricultural market in Western Europe. Rather than
concentrate their efforts on the daunting task of trying to regain
limited markets already lost, however, U.S. farmers stand to gain much
more from looking to the growing markets of the future. For instance,
farmers need to develop the Asian and Latin American markets and be
poised to move into Africa as that market awakens. U.S. agriculture is
now at a crossroads where it must use its advantageous position to
capture a greater share of these expanding markets stimulated by the
rising food needs of a growing population.
<P>
DOMESTIC BENEFITS OF GROWTH-ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND EXPORT POLICIES
<P>
     American farmers have much to gain if policies are amended to
take full advantage of GATT. First, however, U.S. policies will have
to be changed to raise output rather than curb it and to make prices
more competitive. U.S. farm programs today use non-recourse loans,
target prices, and deficiency payments to stabilize the income of
farmers producing certain commodities. "Non-recourse" means a farmer
can borrow money from the government on his harvested crop and then
either repay the loan and sell the crop or default on the loan and
forfeit the crop to the government. The farmer's credit rating is not
affected by his default, and the loan in reality is a minimum
guaranteed income from his crop. If a target price is established for
a particular commodity, the government pays the farmer a "deficiency
payment" (the difference between the target price and the average
market price) if the market price falls below that target. Again, this
means the farmer has a minimum guaranteed income.
<P>
     The loan rates also establish a floor under the commodity price
and signal to the rest of the world what a foreign producer must
charge for his product to beat the American price. Because the U. S.
product is usually the higher-priced product in the international
export market, buyers often turn to the U.S. market only after first
exhausting the supplies offered by other exporters.
<P>
     Increasing Farm Incomes. Periods of export growth historically
have been periods of large income gain for U.S. farmers. In the early
1970s, for example, U.S. grain exports doubled in just four years.
According to J.B. Penn, then Deputy Administrator for Economics at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, "net farm income reached the highest
level since World War II and parts of the agricultural sector enjoyed
nearly unparalleled prosperity." (D. Gale Johnson, ed., "Food and
Agricultural Policy for the 1980's," American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, 1981.)
<P>
     In the 1980s, on the other hand, the United States priced itself
out of international markets by setting too high a floor under
commodity prices in the 1981 farm bill. That legislation provided
automatic increases in loan rates to reflect the double-digit
inflation the country was experiencing at the time. These rigid
minimum loan rates effectively established a minimum export price.
(Farm legislation sets loan rates for major commodities which
establish a floor under the commodity price by allowing the producer
to choose to sell his crop and repay the loan or forfeit his crop to
the government and keep the money. The 1981 farm bill established
these loan rates with automatic escalators, which ultimately exceeded
the inflation rate. Rather than selling their crop which conceivably
could then have found their way to an export outlet, most producers
forfeited their crops to the government and kept the government loan,
which was higher than the prevailing world market prices.) Foreign
competitors undersold these artificially high prices, and U.S. exports
fell. 
<P>
     Domestic commodity prices fell even lower because the resulting
stockpile of surplus commodities continued to depress the markets.
Recognizing that the automatically escalating loan rates in the 1981
farm bill priced American agricultural producers out of the export
market, Congress provided flexibility to decrease loan rates in the
1985 farm bill. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, new mistakes were made in the 1985 farm bill.
Target prices were kept relatively high, which meant that U.S. farmers
became dependent on the federal government for an even greater share
of income. Rather than dealing with this budget concern directly, the
1985 farm bill called for a greater reliance on the use of acreage
reduction programs to control costs and created the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), also intended to reduce production available
for program eligibility, despite the fact that attempting to bolster
domestic farm prices by restricting supply severely limits the export
potential of U.S. farmers. Thus, after gaining a growing share of
world grain usage in the 1970s, U.S. farmers saw that share fall
significantly after the return to supply management policies in the
early 1980s.
<P>
     As in any other sector of the economy, a farm policy designed to
raise farm incomes should promote growth in world consumption and try
to capture a larger share of that consumption for U.S. exporters.
Fuller and more efficient use of production resources is the key to
this since it lowers unit costs and increases export revenues. In
short, greater and more efficient production increases total volume
and widens the margin of profit.
<P>
     A recent study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed
Foundation indicates that returning 38 million idled acres to
production could increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion and net
farm income by $4 billion. (Abel, Daft and Earley, an economic
analysis consulting firm, located in Alexandria, Virginia, conducted a
study on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture 20/20 Project of The National
Grain and Feed Foundation. The study "Large-Scale Land Idling Has
Retarded Growth of U.S. Agriculture," was released in May 1994.)
Taxpayers also would benefit from such increased production because
farmers would receive a greater share of their income from the
marketplace rather than from the federal government -- which for the
last 10 years has spent an average of some $14 billion annually on
commodity programs (see the above chart).
<P>
     Reinvigorating the Rural Economy. The federal government's supply
control policies have a widespread impact on the entire U.S. economy.
Stagnant economic activity in the U.S. agricultural sector leads to a
loss of jobs not just in farming, but also in the supply, processing,
and marketing industries. In addition, agribusinesses reduce their
investments of capital needed to replace obsolete equipment and fully
utilize technological advancements. This hits major businesses
producing such items as heavy farm equipment. Moreover, without
capital investment, the United States cannot be a dominant force in
processing and selling agricultural products internationally. 
<P>
     Changes in U.S. agricultural policy that stimulate greater
output, on the other hand, will give agribusiness the incentive to
invest in greater economic efficiency. Such a growth-oriented policy
would restore the United States as the world's premier farm producer
and exporter. It also would revive the vast and valuable agricultural
infrastructure, much of which -- though still surpassing that of other
countries -- has been allowed to deteriorate during the past decade. A
free market revolution thus would bring economic growth to rural
communities, generating jobs in businesses that provide inputs to
farmers and that process and market their crops. This expanded
economic activity could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs,
providing a much-needed boost to the rural economy.
<P>
     Increasing agricultural production also would have an impact on
the rest of the American economy. A multiplier effect would spread the
benefits of increased production from producers to processors and
distributors and would include the seed, fertilizer, chemical,
transportation, equipment manufacturing and construction industries.
Thus, the study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed Foundation
concludes that returning 38 million acres to production would not
merely boost farm income by $4 billion, but could "increase national
income by $28.9 billion annually and generate over 225,000 more full-
time jobs." (Ibid.)
<P>
A PRO-GROWTH FARM BILL IN 1995
<P>
     Ten years ago, the one significant reform in the 1985 farm bill
was based on a recognition that the United States, if it was to be a
successful agriculture exporter, had to allow farm prices to be
competitive. The 1995 farm bill could build on this by enabling
farmers to capture the benefits of agricultural trade reform.
<P>
     In order to capitalize on the future expansion of world trade,
the 1995 farm bill must promote and reward growth. The United States
produces more agricultural products than it can consume domestically,
and the gap between its production potential and its domestic demand
base is widening. Agricultural productivity will continue to advance
because of biotechnological breakthroughs and the use of such new
technologies as "site specific production." (When site-specific
production becomes available for commercial use, producers will be
able to use this satellite technology to maximize production by
applying the optimum amount of seed, fertilizer, and nutrients per
acre of cultivation.) 
<P>
     The first goal of the 1995 farm bill thus must be to enhance U.S.
agriculture's position as a competitive exporter. In an increasingly
competitive market, it is the low-cost producer that will capture new
markets and the resultant income. But supply controls and export
subsidies inhibit U.S. agriculture's ability to exploit its
competitive position. Specifically, in order to achieve a pro-growth
agricultural policy and realize the benefits that will flow from such
a policy, the following actions must be taken in the 1995 farm bill:
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction (ARP) or set-aside programs. 
<P>
     U.S. agricultural policy uses subsidy programs that rely
generally on supply control mechanisms instead of the market to
maintain farm income. For most of this decade, the United States has
been the only major farm producer to follow a policy of deliberately
idling productive land. More recently, the U.S. has persuaded the
European Union to begin similar supply control policies. This policy
does more than physically limit the amount of product available for
export, it also undermines the competitiveness of U.S. farm products
overseas because fixed production costs are spread across fewer
producing acres. This raises the farmer's cost of production per
bushel and leaves the established network of agricultural supply,
servicing, and processing industries to operate at a reduced capacity,
which raises handling costs and discourages maintenance and
reinvestment. Moreover, land idling tends to reduce demand for -- and
lower the prices of -- such things as seeds and fertilizers. When
these are exported because of limits on domestic production, the
result is lower production costs for America's competitors, who wisely
do not limit production.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
<P>
     The CRP, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, was intended to target
erodible croplands for removal from production and to encourage
conservation. It now includes over 36 million acres on which
landowners receive rental payments under ten-year contracts in return
for removing the land from production. Much of this acreage actually
is highly productive land that, through utilization of readily
available conservation practices, is not vulnerable to unacceptable
erosion. The CRP contracts will begin to expire in 1995, and about
two-thirds will expire by 1997. A modified CRP should include only
highly erodible acres. Based upon USDA's land capability
classification system, about 22 million of the acres enrolled in the
CRP are in the top land capability classes with relatively low
erodibility. Only 4 million are highly erodible, while the remaining
10 million are of debatable erodibility.
<P>
     In the last twelve years, acreage reduction programs and the
Conservation Reserve Program have removed a total of almost 650
million acres from production. This would cover an area about four
times the size of Texas and is some 45 percent greater than the total
area of U.S. cropland annually under production, which is
approximately 450 million acreas (see the chart on the preceeding
page).
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). 
<P>
     The EEP pays exporters to dump agricultural products on the world
market at discounted prices by providing the exporter a dollar subsidy
price for specified quantities of commodities to be exported. Since
its inception, the EEP has been used primarily on grains. Previously,
the EEP was provided in the form of bonus commodities from CCC stocks.
Then, at least, the program added to exportable supplies. Now, even
that marginal benefit has disappeared.
<P>
     Such a program cannot be justified in a post-Uruguay Round world.
For one thing, the GATT agreement requires governments to cut back
such subsidies. For another, because export subsidies tend to
encourage sales of certain commodities by making the purchase of those
commodities relatively attractive, regardless of actual demand, they
distort markets to the disadvantage of the exporter with the greatest
growth potential, which is the United States. Because the EEP allows
the United States to continue temporarily to export products based on
an artificial stimulus rather than on real demand, it makes the U.S.
agricultural system sluggish and unresponsive and wastes resources
that could be used better elsewhere. 
<P>
     Continued use of export subsidies will serve only to depress
world grain and oilseed prices while distorting buyer-seller
relationships between countries. The elimination of export subsidies
on grain in particular would improve the global competitiveness not
only of grain, but also of oilseeds and livestock produced in the
United States.
<P>
     If these changes in U.S. farm policy are made, U.S. producers
will be the best positioned to serve growing world demand. By using
the natural advantages that enable it to be the low-cost producer, the
United States once again can become a successful exporter of
agricultural products.
<P>
OBSTACLES TO REFORM
<P>
     These reforms will not happen automatically, however. Certain
sectors of U.S. agriculture, such as the National Association of Wheat
Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Farmers Union, do not
seem to recognize the economic and job-creating opportunities created
by the new global marketplace. They believe that GATT will make U.S.
farmers more vulnerable to competition from imports. In fact, in
hearings held this past summer, a number of commodity and farm groups
claimed that GATT reforms will make it even more important to keep
present farm programs with little or no change in order to protect
U.S. agriculture from competition. (The House Agriculture Subcommittee
on General Farm Commodities held hearings in June and July of 1994 to
review the general outlook for the farm economy and commodity
programs.)
<P>
     Such reluctance to change is natural, since very few farmers have
ever known anything other than a system of subsidies and supply
controls. But if this siege mentality prevails, it will condemn U.S.
agriculture to stagnation while other countries enjoy the fruits of
new markets. Fortunately, in a recent survey of readers conducted by
Top Producer magazine, when asked their opinion of a proposal to
reform farm programs that would eliminate deficiency payments and set-
asides, 26 percent responded favorably. Although 31 percent were
opposed, 34 percent were interested but said they needed more
information. (Top Producer, opinion survey, conducted in February and
March 1994.) Some farmers evidently recognize that dependence on
government subsidies also subjects them to a lackluster future.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Entrepreneurial farmers and agricultural groups should join
forces with those agribusiness concerns that led the fight for NAFTA
and GATT. Much of agribusiness understands the economic benefits of
agricultural trade liberalization and reform. Through past experience
with short supply situations, they have learned that supply controls
and export subsidies undermine their ability to do business, both here
and abroad, and to provide jobs and prosperity in rural America. 
<P>
     A strong voice for a future based on opportunity, not
protectionism, is needed now more than ever. U.S. agriculture faces an
historic opportunity, as a result of NAFTA and GATT reforms, to
reestablish its preeminence in the world export market. If Congress
takes the actions necessary to establish America's position as the
world leader in meeting the growing demands of this new market, the
result will be decades of prosperity ahead for farmers and greater
economic growth and stability in rural America. 
<P>
     The 1995 farm bill provides the opportunity to make the necessary
changes in agricultural policy. Four or five more years likely will
pass before farm legislation is considered again. By then, farmers in
the rest of the world already will have taken advantage of the
opportunity to meet the demands of the global marketplace. Thus, if
this opportunity is missed, rural America will face a future of
continued economic stagnation.

<P>
CONGRESS DECIDING FUTURE OF AMERICA'S FARMERS
<P>
By John Frydenlund
<P>
 
<P>
 Everyone who buys food or pays federal taxes should be interested
in the coming congressional battle over the 1995 farm bill. The
issue is simple: Whether Congress will unleash the unrivaled productive
power of U.S. agriculture or keep U.S. farmers plodding along
under a tired, worn-out farm program created during the Great
Depression.
<P>
 The right decision could produce significant savings for both
consumers and taxpayers, while producing an estimated $35 billion
windfall for rural America.
<P>
 Gradually doing away with the current farm program over a five
year period -- and letting farmers produce for customers around
the world without interference from Washington -- is the way to
get there. The farm bill is the place to start.
<P>
 The prospect of generating $35 billion worth of new farm income
ought to be a powerful incentive for Congress to act, especially
considering how the new prosperity would be spread throughout
the country, according to a detailed computer model we put together
at The Heritage Foundation to measure the impact of phasing out
the farm program.
<P>
 While all states would benefit in the long-run, from California
to Florida, the greatest short-term benefits would be seen in
the midwest farm belt.  Five heartland states -- Colorado, Kansas,
 Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota -- would receive a healthy
$5.7 billion chunk of the increased farm income. This is after
factoring in added production costs and decreased &quot;deficiency
payments&quot; in which the government pays farmers the difference
between the market price and a government-imposed &quot;target
price&quot; or loan rate, whichever is smaller. By the way, the
following figures are for net income after the end of all federal
deficiency payments:
<P>
 * Colorado -- The Centennial State's wheat and corn producers
would see an $82 million increase by 2000, and a total of $1.05
billion more by 2005.
<P>
 * Kansas -- The Jayhawk State's wheat, corn, oats, barley and
soybean growers would receive $158 million in added net income
by the year 2000, and a cumulative total of more than $2.5 billion
by 2005.
<P>
 * Missouri -- Thanks to increased farm production nationwide,
the Show Me State's food processors, as well as Missourians growing
corn, soybeans and wheat, would enjoy $43 million in added net
income in five years, and $709 million by 2005.
<P>
 * Nebraska -- Farm machinery producers would share $25 million
in added net income by 2000 with ranchers and grain producers
in the Cornhusker State. By 2005, the state's farm sector  would
have received nearly $1 billion in increased income.
<P>
 * South Dakota -- Oat, flax seed, sunflower seed and rye growers
here would receive $21 million in added net income by 2000, and
more than $546 million total by 2005.
<P>
 Texas is another big winner. By 2000, the Lone Star State's wheat,
cotton, rice and peanut producers would see a $13 million increase,
but by 2005 the total would skyrocket to $1.08 billion.
<P>
 With such a cornucopia available, one naturally wonders why farmers
failed to reap such benefits before now? The answer is because
the United States has never weaned itself off the current system,
which was created in the 1930s to protect farmers from the volatility
of a Depression-era marketplace.
<P>
 Reform opponents are defending a costly, bureaucratic maze of
special interest subsidies, deficiency payments, price supports,
acreage allotments and red tape. Everybody but the politicians,
Department of Agriculture bureaucrats and a few richly favored
farmers will be big losers if Congress protects this creaky relic.
<P>
 This is because under the current farm program 65 percent of
all federal farm payments go to a mere 16 percent of farmers,
those with gross annual sales of $100,000 or more. Small farmers
-- those who sell less than $10,000 worth of farm products each
year -- receive only 5 percent of the payments.
<P>
  Worst of all, the current system forces farmers to plan, invest
and plant as if their only customers are the 250 million consumers
here in America, thus ignoring a growing worldwide food market
of 6 billion hungry people beyond the United States.
<P>
 If our farmers were instead free to plan for the near doubling
population and rising living standards in Asia, Africa and Latin
America in coming years -- where demand for food is expected to
triple -- there is no telling how much prosperity could be ahead.
<P>
 Members of Congress should understand that, if the 1995 farm
bill begins the process of eliminating government subsidies and
controls, America's farmers will be able to out-produce and outsell
the rest of the world, with the expanded production fueling tremendous
increases in farm income and in farm-related businesses. If Congress
keeps the subsidies and controls, farm prosperity will wither
on the vine for years to come.

<h2>Abolishing the Department of Education In Order to Liberate Parents and Schools</h2><p>
<h3>A Joint Statement by Former Secretaries of Education</h3><br>
<h3>Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett</h3><p>
<i><b>Delivered before the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigation</i></b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: <p>
 
It is a particular pleasure for us to address this Committee with its 
new name, new majority and new chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to set forth our views on the federal role in education. 
You have an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history in this domain. <p>
 
In this statement we outline a fundamental transformation; namely, 
reversing the direction of a mighty river that, for the past thirty 
years, has flowed in the direction of Washington, D.C. We have 
long been convinced that this river -- of responsibility, authority and 
accountability for American education -- should instead flow 
toward our families, schools, communities and states we sketch in 
this statement, and the principles on which they rest, are not new 
for us, for the Presidents we have served, or for many more of our 
fellow Republicans. What has changed is that it is finally within the 
capacity of the Congress to put them into action. <p>
 

<center><h3>What's Gone Wrong </h3></center><p>
 
The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in 
Washington over the past several decades. The national government 
has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes 
more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is 
misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for 
their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of 
distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and 
teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to 
lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the 
renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, 
that Washington knows best and is taking charge. <p>
 
We and Presidents Reagan and Bush did all we could to reverse the 
flow, place the emphasis on states and communities, promote 
flexibility and choice, forge a true partnership with the governors, 
end discrimination against individuals without preferential treatment 
for any group, and halt Washington's growing regulatory apparatus. 
But every such effort was rebuffed by the Democratic Congress -- 
now aided and abetted by the Clinton administration -- which has 
pressed relentlessly in the opposite direction, encouraged in this 
endeavor by education's myriad special interest groups. <p>
 
To anyone who thinks we exaggerate, we recommend reading the 
full texts of Goals 2000 and "H.R.6", the administration's two main 
education bills -- particularly as these were finally enacted by the 
103rd Congress. Especially when they are taken in combination, it 
becomes plain that their authors 'want to substitute decisions made 
in Washington for decisions made by individual households and 
communities. They transform what had been a national movement 
into a federal program. They create new governance structures and 
regulatory mechanisms at both national and state levels. They use 
federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the 
behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 
"voluntary". They throw obstacles onto such promising reform 
pathways as school choice and private management of public 
schools. They strip the bi-partisan National Assessment Governing 
Board of much of its independence. And they do all this while pretending otherwise, by wrapping themselves in rhetoric of 
"helping" education and pasting friendly-sounding titles on the 
cover (H.R.6 was dubbed the "Improving America's Schools Act") 
while in reality their contents were written by and for lobbyists and 
interest groups to whom the skills and knowledge of children are 
not the top priority. <p>
 
Federal education policy has been moving in this direction since 
1965. It took a breather, at least within the executive branch 
between 1981 and 1992, but the past two years have seen the pent-
up "governmentalism" of that decade unleashed upon the land. For 
a time we supposed that it was possible to have a national 
education reform project that worked like a true and durable 
partnership and did not evolve into another rule-bound federal 
program. The last two years have proven us wrong. In addition to 
Goals 2000 and H.R.6, we have seen the executive branch give 
blanket endorsement to scholarships based on race; take the heat 
off those who would use "diversity" as a criterion for accreditation; 
propose the race-norming of state assessment results; and persecute 
states that employ test-based standards for high school graduation. 
It's now clear that the federal government will eventually break 
whatever it touches. Rather than tinker around the margins, 
therefore, the time has come for a great and thorough change. <p>
 

<center><h3>A Different Philosophy </center></h3><p>
 
The essential part of our proposal is not its particulars but the four 
principles on which it rests. It is these, above all, that we commend 
to the Committee's consideration. One can adjust the details that 
follow. Any comprehensive overhaul based on these principles, 
however, will represent fundamental redirection -- and an historic 
accomplishment, worth the new Congress. <p>
 
First, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of the 
states the social responsibility of communities, and the moral 
responsibility of families. <p>
 
Second, except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the 
federal government should never impede the capacity of families, 
teachers, communities and states to decide how best to provide 
education to their children, and should never substitute its judgment 
for theirs. <p>
 
Third, goals, standards, assessments, the dissemination of 
information and ideas, and the encouragement of bold innovation 
are legitimate leadership and "bully pulpit" activities of national 
officials, but they must always be truly voluntary on the part of 
states and communities. Nor should federal funds be used as 
"carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local 
control. <p>


Fourth, insofar as the federal government is engaged at all in the 
field of education, it should dedicate itself to (a) fostering family 
responsibility and local control; (b) assisting states to fulfill their 
responsibilities as they see fit; (c) providing sound statistics, prompt 
and accurate assessment results and other information; and (d) 
safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination. <p>
 

<center><h3>Repairing Recent Damage </center></h3><p>

In the 1,200 or so pages of the Goals 2000 and H.R.6 legislation 
enacted last year is considerable mischief that should immediately 
be defunded and then repealed. Ten leading candidates include: <p>
 
1. The National Education Standards and Improvement Council -- 
the "national school board" that is so vivid a symbol of education 
wrong-think in Washington, and the new state panels mandated by 
Goals 2000. Our states and communities have all the governments 
they need; they don't need new decision-making structures designed 
in Washington. <p>
 
2. Federal ''certification'' of national and state education standards 
and federal approval of state and local education reform plans. 
Those controversial new standards should make their own way 
through the marketplace of ideas without any federal "seal of 
approval." Nor do federal bureaucrats have any business second-
guessing state and local priorities for school reform. <p>
 
3. Prohibitions and disincentives for state/local testing programs 
and accountability systems. Among the most dismaying features of 
Goals 2000 (and recent actions by the Office for Civil Rights) is the 
effort to discourage the very tests that might actually encourage our 
students to learn more -- and give parents and taxpayers better 
information. <p>
4. New "gender equity" programs. The last thing we need is the 
federal government telling America's 15,000 communities how to 
teach little boys and little girls about one another -- or mandating 
how teachers are to handle such matters. Nor do we need a new 
"special assistant for gender equity" to enforce such mandates. <p>
 
5. Federal regulation of schools' weapons policies and sex 
education. That's why we have parents, teachers, principals and 
school boards. <p>
 
6. All references to "opportunity to learn" standards. If the 
experience of American education these past thirty years has taught 
us anything, it's the importance of maintaining a laser-like focus on 
student achievement and of creating accountability systems that are 
based on school results. The recent legislation deflects attention 
back toward such "inputs" as spending levels, class size, and 
degrees conferred by colleges of education -- and invites even more 
litigation based on such spurious gauges while discouraging true 
accountability for schools, teachers and students. <p>


7. Disincentives for states and localities that want to try such 
reforms as vouchers, charter schools and privatization. If we are 
ever to transform American education, we must give families -- 
especially poor families -- the right to choose their children's 
schools from among all the schools in their communities; give 
communities opportunities to create "break the mold schools" that 
are not regulated to death by the bureaucracy; and invite the private 
sector to help interested communities create the best schools in the 
world. Yet the recent legislation places obstacles in the path of 
states and communities that want to try such things. -What sort of 
choice program allows the sending" school to deny children the 
right to leave? The sort enacted in H.R.6. <p>
 
8. Extension of Davis-Bacon provisions to school construction and 
renovation. That means a principal in Moline who wants to hire a 
contractor to rewire his school for new computers must pay the 
prevailing union wage rather than getting the job done for the 
lowest cost. It's a big favor for the unions, but no favor at all for 
schools, efficiency or economy. <p>
 
9. The addition of two more national goals to the original six. 
Parent involvement and teacher training are fine, but goals should 
be limited to specific, measurable results, such as President Bush 
and the Governors (including then-governor Bill Clinton) 
established in Charlottesville. <p>
 
10. Weakening the National Assessment Governing Board. Our 
best source of reliable student achievement data at the national and 
state levels is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the 
integrity of which depends on the absolute independence and 
complete policy control of its Governing Board. H.R.6 undermined 
that board, giving greater influence to education interest groups and 
to a sluggish federal bureaucracy that is easily politicized. <p>
 

<center><h3>Reasons for Devolution</center></h3><p>
 
Mr. Chairman, here is the heart of our proposal for the long term: 
the Congress should take every single activity currently housed in 
the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) 
send it home to the states and communities; (b) entrust it to another 
federal agency that is suited to conduct it in harmony with related 
activities; or (c) abolish it on grounds that the federal government 
can no longer afford to spend money on programs that have 
outlived their usefulness or that can be handled satisfactorily by 
others. We will not endeavor here to fill in every detail or answer 
each question that might be asked about this far-reaching 
recommendation, but the examples that follow indicate its main 
features. <p>
 
<center><h3>Sending responsibility home </center></h3><p>
 
* Virtually all major programs assisting elementary/secondary 
education should be combined into a "block" and returned to the 
states and communities. This can be accomplished in several ways: 
the best, in our judgment, is a "responsibility swap" whereby the 
states assume full responsibility for education in return for federal 
assumption of other burdens now borne by the states; or a resource 
base transfer in which some federal tax is reduced by an amount 
equivalent to the programs in question, thereby leaving it to state 
and communities to raise and deploy these revenues as they see fit. 
A third approach is a no-strings "block grant" of federal fund to the 
state, though we like this least because of the well-known tendency 
of block grants to grow strings as time passes. <p>
 
The core of this block are programs under the headings of 
"education reform" (including goals 2000), school improvement, 
education for the disadvantaged, bilingual education, and vocational 
and adult education -- approximately $10 billion in all. That means 
upwards of a billion dollars a year for a big state like California and 
about $200 million for a smaller one like Tennessee, funds that the 
state and its communities would be free to spend it for any 
educational purpose, including such innovations as charter schools 
and vouchers. (The distribution formula can retain the equity-
conscious fiscal effects of today's programs.) The federal 
government would no longer define legitimate education reform, 
nor would states and communities have to submit their plans to 
Washington for approval. <p>
 
We will leave it to the budget-and-appropriations process to 
determine whether the block should equal the sum of its antecedent 
programs, but we note that a number of governors have made clear 
their willingness to endure a funding reduction in return for the 
freedom to deploy the remainder as their states see fit. We also note 
that eliminating the heavy overhead and "middleman" costs of 
current categorical programs (at both federal and state levels) will 
concentrate more resources on teaching and learning. <p>
 
A block grant to the states should also combine a number of the 
smaller higher education programs, with the exception of the main 
student financial aid programs. These deserve serious consultation 
with the governors and persons knowledgeable about higher 
education and finance. Today, one out of two college students in 
America has a federal grant or loan, and helping needy students 
attend college is a national function worth preserving. But these 
programs are poorly managed, needlessly costly, and full of 
middlemen, each of which takes its cut. In the near term, we 
recommend transferring the main student aid programs to a federal 
agency with greater competence in handling complex financial 
transactions with millions of individuals (and in collecting what is 
owed the government). An obvious candidate is the Treasury 
Department, with its Internal Revenue Service. Over the longer 
term, additional student aid strategies should be fully explored, 
including devolution to the states and privatization. <p>
 
* Special education and rehabilitation services also warrant 
consultation with the governors. This is by far the largest 
"unfunded" education mandate, i.e. federal regulations require the 
expenditure by states and localities of many billions more than the 
federal aid provided. It would, therefore, be reasonable to 
incorporate these programs into the main elementary/secondary 
block grant. Alternatively, they could become a smaller block grant 
of their own. (Total current value: approximately $5.7 billion.) Or 
these programs could be transferred to the Department of Health 
and Human Services. <p>


We want to be clear on this point: protection of the civil rights of 
disabled individuals would remain a federal responsibility, to be 
carried out by the Justice Department. <p>
 

<center><h3>Transfers </center></h3><p>
 
* All civil rights enforcement would move to the Justice 
Department, with the admonition that it be vigorously carried out 
when discrimination against individuals is involved, but not used as 
a tool for granting or withholding rights and benefits on the basis of 
group membership. <p>
 
The gathering, analysis and reporting of education statistics would 
be placed under the jurisdiction of the National Education Goals 
Panel, consisting of governors, legislators, members of Congress 
and senior officials of the executive branch. Assessment of student 
achievement at the international, national and state levels would 
become the unambiguous responsibility of a rehabilitated National 
Assessment Governing Board, overseen in turn by the Goals Panel. <p>
 
* As noted above, any student aid programs not devolved to the 
states would move to a fiscal agency such as the Treasury 
Department, while any special education and rehabilitation 
programs not turned over to the states would move to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. <p>
 
* Indian education programs would be transferred to the Interior 
Department. <p>
 
A small number of federal programs that assist specialized 
institutions (e.g. Gallaudet College, Howard University) and are 
now the responsibility of the Education Department deserve 
scrutiny to see whether the present subsidy arrangements should 
continue. Insofar as they do, any of a number of executive branch 
agencies can oversee future resource transfers. <p>
 
<center><h3>Abolition </center></h3><p>
 
The Education Department currently manages about 250 separate 
programs. Perhaps fifty of these have entirely outlived their 
usefulness, or support activities that the federal government could 
beneficially stop subsidizing, or provide marginal aid for activities 
that are fundamentally the responsibility of others but have been 
maintained as federal "categorical" programs due to the strength of 
special interest lobbies. Such programs should be abolished or "de-
funded" and the savings returned to federal taxpayers. (We estimate 
these at $2 to 3 billion annually, i.e. as much as $15 billion over five 
years.) We will not here provide a complete list, but illustrative 
examples include federal technical assistance centers of several 
kinds, regional "educational laboratories," library support programs, 
literacy programs for prisoners, women's educational equity, law 
school clinical experience, Olympic scholarships and "star schools." <p>


Savings would also result from dismantling the regulatory 
infrastructure, including most of the costs of Education Department 
management (about $444 million) and the National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council. <p>
 

<center><h3>Structural Implications </center></h3><p>
 
Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would 
leave  The Department of Education with nothing to do, there 
would be no need to retain it. <p>
 
Although any "news" coming out of our testimony may be that 
"two former education secretaries urge abolition of department they 
once headed," let us be clear that we did not come before the 
Committee to recommend a label change or symbolic beheading. <p>
 
Today's Department of Education has two essential failings. First, it 
has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless 
expenditures, obsolete programs, dysfunctional regulations and the 
depredations of special interests that care more about the well-
being of education's "producers" than for its "consumers." <p>
 
Second, it has an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its 
nose into areas where it has no proper business. Most of what it 
does today is no legitimate affair of the federal government. The 
Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief 
that American parents, teachers, communities and states are too 
stupid to raise their own children, run their own schools and make 
their own decisions. <p> 
Abolishing the Department will accomplish little if its meddlesome 
ways are transferred intact to another federal bureaucracy. Indeed, 
such a shift could even be harmful to the extent that it serves to 
"hide" those activities in less visible locations. In our view, the way 
to think about the Education Department is first in terms of what it 
does, then in terms of its structure and status. <p>
 
Because we believe that each of the Department's activities that is 
worth preserving in some form could better be handled elsewhere, 
we see no need for a separate federal education agency of any kind. <p>
 
Our purpose is not to reduce the attention that the nation pays to 
education. Indeed, there's never been a time in our history when 
education was more important -- or more in need of a complete 
overhaul. Whether one is concerned with developing virtue in the 
young, preparing tomorrow's adults for life in the information age, 
widening the shared core knowledge base of a diverse population, 
strengthening our economic competitiveness or enabling poor 
people to move from the back of the line to the front, we have few 
assets of greater value than effective education. <p>


"National leadership" can be helpful in focusing people on problems 
and opportunities. We look to the President, with the help of an 
education advisor housed in the White House, to the National 
Education Goals Panel to ensure that the national project of 
educational renewal continues apace. But true leadership means 
energizing people and communities change, not shackling them with 
mandates and regulations -- and calling it leadership. We do not 
need a raft of federal programs. We do not need a giant 
bureaucracy. We do not need a federal department. What we need 
is a national movement. We are convinced that the-- prospects for 
such a movement -- and for real educational renewal in America -- 
will be far brighter when the Congress signals unmistakably and 
irrevocably that responsibility rests with teachers and parents, with 
communities and states, not with federal bureaucrats. <p>
 
Reversing the flow of this river is no small undertaking. But it 
would do immeasurable good for our children, our schools, our 
communities and our future. <p>

<H3> CANDIDATES FOR RESCISSION IN THE FY 1995

Committee Brief #7<br>
          (published at 3 pages, February 24, 1995)
<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

 
     We are here today to determine ways to cut the 1995 education
budget. Let me say at the outset that, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only
a very small percentage of the over $31 billion the federal government
spends on education ever actually makes it into America's classrooms. Most
of the Department of Education's budget and programs go to fund technical
assistance, clearinghouses, information, and specific programs that educators
in our states and communities neither need nor want. I spend a good amount
of my time working with educators in these states and communities. When
asked what the federal government and the U.S. Congress can do to improve
their schools, they overwhelmingly reply, "Leave us alone!"
<P>
     Federal funding for education has tripled in constant dollars from
1965 to the present. Student performance, by contrast, has declined over the
same period. Clearly, additional federal spending on education is not the
answer. Yet, the Clinton Administration, in its 1995 budget, sought $26.1
billion in discretionary budget authority, a $1.7 billion increase over last
year. Similarly, the Administration sought $5.6 billion for mandatory
programs, an increase of $1.1 billion over the $4.5 billion spent in 1994.
They sought a total increase in budget authority from $28.8 billion to $31.7
billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 9.9 percent.
<P>
     The appropriation for the Department of Education has more than
doubled in the last fourteen years from around $15 billion to over $31
billion. From 1981-1992, the amount the U.S. Congress appropriated for the
Department of Education was actually greater than the amounts that
Presidents Reagan and Bush requested in their budgets every single year.
Since President Clinton has taken office, the President's request for the
Department of Education has exceeded the appropriation. It is also
interesting to note that the amount spent by the Department of Education for
post-secondary education (programs that include student loans, Pell Grants,
research grants, etc.) was greater than the amount spent on elementary and
secondary education from 1981-1990. This was because the original role of
the federal government in education was to ensure access to post-secondary
education and to fund research programs. The Clinton Administration has
reversed this historical breakdown and now spends more on elementary and
secondary education than on post-secondary education. This is unfortunate
since a greater percentage of federal spending on post-secondary education
actually helps individual students gain access to education. By contrast, most
of the federal money spent on elementary and secondary education goes to
fund the education bureaucracies and comes with burdensome mandates to
the state and local education agencies. Students benefit only from a very
small percentage of federal government spending on elementary and
secondary education.
<P>
     The goal of the 104th Congress, both in rescissions for the 1995
budget and in authorizations for future years, must be to evaluate each and
every one of the over 240 Department of Education categorical programs
(up from 140 programs in 1980) and determine whether these programs
actually improve the education of our children. The Congress also must
consolidate effective programs, eliminate ineffective programs, and stop
funding programs that benefit bureaucracies. To meet these ends, Congress
should make the following specific reforms:
<P>
End Several Programs. The Clinton Administration proposed cutting 34
categorical programs from the Department of Education. The 103rd
Congress cut only 13 of the programs. The 104th Congress should start by
rescinding funding for the remaining programs, including: the Ellender
Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation), Education for Native Hawaiians,
Foreign Language Assistance, Consumer and Homemaking Education, State
Student Incentive Grants, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program,
Cooperative Education, Assistance to Guam, College Housing and Academic
Facilities Loan Program, Public Library Construction, Library Literacy
Programs, Library Education and Training, Library Research and
Demonstrations, Foreign Periodicals Program, Impact Aid 3(b) Payments,
Educational Partnerships Program, Immigrant Education, Dropout Prevention
Demonstrations, Vocational Education Community Based Organizations, and
Civics Education.
<P>
Change Recently Enacted Programs. There were four major education
programs either created or reauthorized in 1993 and 1994. All of these
programs, including Goals 2000: Educate America Act, reauthorization of
federal elementary and secondary programs in the Improving America's
Schools Act, the Federal Direct Student Loan program, and the National
Service Trust Act of 1993 should be revisited.
<P>
Goals 2000: Educate America Act
President Clinton proposed spending $700 million in 1995 for Goals 2000,
an increase of $595 million over the 1994 level. He called for $1 billion a
year for this program, to continue indefinitely, beginning in fiscal year 1996.
Congress appropriated $403.4 million, up 298.4 percent from the $105
million appropriated in 1994. The Clinton Administration claims that states
must distribute 85 percent of their Goals 2000 grants to local educational
agencies which must then use the money to "create and implement content,
performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards in academic areas, improve
professional development and licensure, and improve curricula and teaching
practices in individual schools." Goals 2000 funds go to three new
educational bureaucracies: the National Education Goals Panel, the National
Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and a National
Skills Standards Board. None of these activities, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, will improve local schools. Many of these activities are merely
new mandates put on the states and localities. This ineffective program will
become much larger, more bureaucratic, and more expensive unless it is
downsized and eventually eliminated through the appropriations process.
<P>
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act
 <P>    There are many areas in which funding can be cut and rescinded in
this expansive program. President Clinton requested $10.281 billion in his
1995 budget, and Congress appropriated $9.94 billion, a $475 million
increase from 1994. Much of this money goes to fund bureaucracies and
should be cut, including: the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program, Arts in Education, Eisenhower Professional Development Federal
Activities, Women's Educational Equity Fund for Improvement of
Education, Indian Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Ready to
Learn Act, among others. Congress should also alter the expansive Title I
program, perhaps giving the money directly to poor parents in the form of
educational vouchers that they can then use at the school of their choice.
<P>
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program
<P>     This act has done nothing to reduce the complexity of administering
student loans, eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to
students and schools. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Department of
Education has hired 600 new employees to administer the direct loan
programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when the phase-
in of the program is completed. Congress should cap this program, which
has gone from being an "experimental" program when passed to a
"transitional" program. All new funding for this program should be
rescinded.
<P>
 The National Service Trust Act of 1993<P>
This act created a new bureaucracy, the Corporation for National and
Community Service, and a new entitlement for middle-class students. In
1995, Congress appropriated $575 million for National Service activities,
included in eight programs. This is an increase of $205 million from the
1994 appropriation. These numbers do not include the $791.8 million
appropriated in 1995 for the five programs operating under the Corporation
for National and Community Service. This amount is an increase of $216.4
million from the $575.4 million appropriated in 1994. These funds should
either be eliminated through rescission or merged into means-tested work
study and Pell Grant programs.<P>
Eliminate Institutional Aid. There are currently seven programs, totaling
$229.7 million, that aid specific institutions. Congress increased the
authorization for these institutions by $16.7 million in 1995. These programs
should be eliminated. Similarly, Congress currently appropriates $193
million to Howard University for the endowment and research programs. No
other university in this country receives such a high level of federal support.
The appropriations for Howard should be rescinded and eliminated, and the
university should rely on private sector support as do all other major private
universities.
<P>
     It is impossible, given the time constraints, to go into all of the other
programs that should be merged, eliminated, or rescinded. However, the
104th Congress should consider merging the many higher education grant
and campus-based programs into one grant, one loan, and one work study
program. It should reevaluate many of the programs falling under the
category of "Educational Research and Improvement" since many of these
programs do little to help educate children. It should privatize the student
loan collection program; revisit, eliminate, and consolidate many Chapter 2
block grant programs; and review and cut many of the categorical programs.
The appropriations committees will ultimately make many of the decisions
on which programs to eliminate. This subcommittee has the power actually
to improve American public education by eliminating many of the programs
containing the mandates and regulations that have strangled innovation for
the past 15 years.

<h2>Education Reform: Putting Power in Parents</h2>
<i><b>A column by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin</i></b> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As parents and members of a community, one of the greatest  
responsibilities we have is to educate our children. <p>
As the proverb goes, "It takes an entire village to raise a child." And there  
is perhaps no greater duty for that "village" than to make sure its children  
gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and  
contribute to their community. <p>
Yet as parents and as a community, we have surprisingly little control 
over how our children are educated. Parents and communities are not 
given the tools or the authority they need to make sure their children are 
succeeding in the classroom. <p>
Currently the power and control over educating our children rests in  
Madison. We have an antiquated, centralized system of education where  
faceless bureaucrats decide how your child should be taught, then place a  
plethora of mandates on local school districts. These mandates tie the  
bands of parents and community leaders who want to have a real voice in  
the education of their children, and they stifle innovation and creativity in  
the classroom. <p> 
In short, the current education system trusts government more than it  
trusts parents and communities. <p> 
Somewhere along the way, government responsibility replaced parental  
responsibility. Somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy became more  
important than the children. Somewhere along the way, defending the  
status quo took precedence over pursuing innovation and improvement. <p> 
No more. The challenge now facing our state is to make the needed  
changes to our education system to put power back into the hands of  
parents, school boards, classroom  teachers and local taxpayers. <p> 
We need to put our trust back into the "village," empowering our parents  
and communities to decide what is best for our children's education.  
trusting parents -- what a radical idea. <p> 
If Thorpe is facing a problem with its schools, I trust that the people of  
Thorpe are best equipped to resolve that problem, not a group of  
bureaucrats in Madison. <p> 
When it comes to education, one size does not fit all. We must give local  
communities the flexibility to meet the unique needs of their children. <p> 
My budget provides an array of initiatives that will facilitate the shift in  
power over education from Madison to our local communities. This starts  
with building a new education structure for the state. The current  
bureaucracy is too mired in the past to change and too self-serving to  
seriously pursue a better way.  <p> 
The new Department of Education proposal in the budget will serve as a  
catalyst for change to a system that cares more about the future of our  
children than about the future of bureaucratic jobs -- a system that trusts  
parents, not government. <p> 
The Department of Education's role will be clear: serve the public. The  
department will help set educational standards for the state and make sure  
our children are meeting those standards (via testing, etc.), but otherwise  
it will step aside and give local communities the flexibility to teach their  
children as they see fit. <p> 
Parents, school boards, teachers, community leaders and local  
taxpayers will work together to chart the best course for their children to  
meet the state's educational standards. The Department of Education  
will serve as a resource center, there to help communities when asked. <p> 
The budget also includes unique programs that meet the same goal of  
giving more control over education to the local community. <p> 
The charter schools initiative gives every community in the state the  
ultimate in flexibility to design schools to meet their unique needs. This  
initiative allows -- and encourages - communities to be innovative and  
visionary in meeting its children's needs. <p>
The public school choice proposal would allow every parent the choice of  
which public school to send their child. If a parent is unhappy with their  
child's school, they would now have a choice. There's no doubt that this  
will help improve the overall quality of all our public schools. <p> 
For Milwaukee only, we would allow low-income parents to send their  
child to a private school if they so choose. With nearly half of the  
students in Milwaukee Public Schools failing to graduate we need to try  
radical ideas that empower parents, particularly poor, minority parents.  
Remember, we all pay the consequences when a young man or woman  
fails to graduate and subsequently falls into a life of government  
dependence. <p> 
This budget is dedicatcd to the pursuit of excellence in education. making  
sure our children can compete -- and win -- in the global marketplace. <p> 
We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and that  
begins with returning power to parents and communities. <p>
When Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Howard Fuller resigned  
recently, he recited the words of William Daggett, who I believe puts our  
education priorities in the proper perspective.  <p> 
Daggett said, "We must love our children's hopes, dreams and prayers  
more than we love the institutional heritage of the school system." <p> 
In short, we need to return power to the village so its people can  
properly raise our children. We need to trust parents and communities,  
not government. <p>

<title>Heritage Lecture: Getting Gov't Out of Higher Education -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 533

<h3>Getting Government Out of Higher Education</h3>
<p>
By Jon Westling
Provost and President-elect, Boston University, delivered May 3, 1995
<p>

One of the pleasures of visiting Washington is the sense of reassurance which gleams from the limestone and marble buildings, the Capitol dome, and the sober monuments. Those of us who live and work far outside the Beltway sometimes need that reassurance, which is a little like the need parents feel when leaving a son or daughter in the safekeeping of a university. After eighteen years of the hard and loving work of raising a child, parents rightly expect a college to be vigilant, caring, and prudent. Nonetheless, as the station wagon pulls away from the curb in front of the dormitory, many a parent suppresses a shudder at what may actually lie ahead.<p>
That feeling is particularly familiar to me because less than a week ago, Boston University submitted an important set of forms to the Department of Education:  our application for continued certification to participate in "Title IV Student Financial Aid Programs."  Except in certain government agencies, of course, eight or nine pounds of paperwork is not the equivalent of a child, but I do feel a certain parental responsibility to this certification homunculus. Boston University labored over it for fourteen weeks and spent about 2,700 hours of employee time feeding it data. We stayed up nights when it had the colic, and we even changed it frequently, as we found that the bureaucrats at DOE who devised the 26 separate schedules hadn't bothered to consult over definitions such as what constitutes an "academic program." <p>

 Anyway, we have now entrusted our little bundle to the DOE and, like the parents in the station wagon, are putting a brave face on our fears. We have confidence that those DOE people are scrupulous and that it was somehow our own fault that it took 2,700 hours --       almost 1 1/2 man-years -- to complete the form, since those scrupulous DOE folk say right on page three of the instructions, "the estimated time to complete the application is three hours." <p>

 The instructions also say, "Most institutions will have the information required for the  application readily available."  This, I admit, is a little more worrisome. I grant that my experience as a university administrator is limited entirely to twenty years at Boston University, so it may be that other colleges and universities routinely permute data on admissions and financial aid according to six or seven disparate formulas. We don't, but Boston University will be able to catch up now that DOE has shown us this remarkable productivity-enhancing tool. <p>

Filling in this application helped Boston University accomplish one of the goals of education:  It made us a little more self-aware. We now know, for example, that of the 35,979 students who enrolled in at least one Boston University course in 1994, precisely ten did not possess a high school diploma. Thanks to the DOE, our cup runneth over with such factoids -- although, I admit, we are not entirely sure what most of them have to do with our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. One would think DOE would observe that our default rate on guaranteed student loans is 4.7 percent, which is 21.3 percent below the so-called "cohort-default rate threshold," and that would be that. <p>

The United States is, by any account, the world's leader in higher education. It has achieved that status by building in the last two hundred years a tremendously diverse array of independent colleges and universities which grew up with distinct educational philosophies and missions. Many were begun by religious denominations, others by self-educated visionaries, some by businessmen and entrepreneurs concerned with the need for educated workers. Typically, they adopted the form that Thomas Jefferson gave to the University of Virginia:  They were governed by boards of trustees charged with making sure the institution lived up to its educational mission. <p>

A lot has changed, little of it for the better. Higher education today is beset with self-inflicted problems. The wrenching of curricula to fit the bizarre doctrines of multiculturalism has left a dislocated and miseducated generation of college graduates. At all-too-many     supposedly elite campuses, students imbibe the theory of writing but can't write beyond a junior high school level. At more than a few universities, we have the shameful spectacle of students -- and faculty members -- shouting down speakers whose views they find exceptionable. Faculty unions, tenured layabouts, charging grant overhead for floral arrangements -- the sweet whiff of corruption -- all these derelictions of responsibility are now well-known, especially to this audience. Tempting as it is, however, I have not come here today to bury these faults deeper in obloquy. <p>

For, in addition to the self-inflicted wounds, higher education bears some other bruises. I draw your attention to the Good Samaritan who thrashes us with a club each time one of us staggers to his feet. I refer, of course, to the federal government and its handy cudgel, the Department of Education. <p>

The DOE no doubt means well. Congress has asked it to fix the problem of soaring default rates in the federally insured student loan program. The problem itself is not intractable, but the combination of experts and tools and instructions which Congress and DOE have assembled is cause for some apprehension. Imagine balancing your checkbook with the aid of three economists, a socket wrench, a can of spray paint, and a copy of Black's Law Dictionary, and you will have some sense of the situation. I'll come to the details in a minute. If matters proceed in this fashion, we still will not have a balanced checkbook, but government bureaucrats will be in charge of virtually every detail of what colleges and universities do. <p>

In speaking of threats, I do not mean to sound like the moping owl in the ivy-mantled tower who "does to the moon complain."  Along with the threats, there are some great opportunities, and this is an occasion to point those out too. If we can pull back from the brink, we will find that American higher education still has tremendous potential to contribute to the vigor, the intellectual and spiritual richness, and the prosperity of American life. <p>

But the brink is real. American higher education is on the verge of losing its most precious asset. It is abandoning or being forced to abandon its robust independence, and it will fade into something worse than mediocrity if the government's regulatory assault is not stopped. <p>

Before describing that regulatory rampage, I should say a word or two about my perspective. "Never confess, never, never confess," says Joseph Conrad's deeply observant man of the sea, Marlowe. I will nonetheless divulge that I was a civil rights protester in the early 1960s. I retain a strong conviction that society can change for the better and that government has an important part to play in that process. I agree with Edmund Burke that, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation," and that to criticize is one thing, but "at once to preserve and to reform is quite another." <p>

Until the 1960s, the federal government intruded very little into university management. The GI Bill and the research funding that followed World War Two were accompanied by surprisingly little red tape. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, however, changed this. By     establishing numerous programs designed to expand access to higher education, the federal government became enmeshed in the attempt to re-shape higher education. <p>

Many of these programs had broad bipartisan and public support. At first, the reams of new government regulations seemed a harmless enough price for programs that promised to benefit everyone, including colleges and universities. Few had the foresight to see that, over the next thirty years, Congress would transform programs meant to open doors to educational opportunities into welfare systems. <p>

Federally insured student loans, for example, were designed with the help of conservative legislators as a means of providing greater access to higher education with a minimum of government involvement. Initially, they expanded opportunity on an equal basis, assisting anyone who met the usual criteria for getting into college. Over these thirty years, however, they have been increasingly used by the government as a low-visibility way to  subsidize selected institutions. <p>

The program began with default rates comparable to those accepted by commercial    lenders. In 1972, the government lifted the ceiling beyond what any commercial lender would tolerate -- and, finding it was good, lifted it again in 1976, in 1978, and in 1983. It is now 25 percent for most institutions and more for "historically black colleges and universities [and] tribally-controlled community colleges."  The average default rate at proprietary schools is over 30 percent. <p>

At the same time, the government began lowering the minimum academic standards   necessary to qualify for loans. Today, neither a high school diploma nor equivalency exam is required for taking out a federally guaranteed loan for what is called "post-secondary" education. Finally, the default rates have soared partly because the government is unwilling to require "disadvantaged" members of society to pay back the loans. <p>

In short, today's student loan crisis is largely the result of permitted defaults by unqualified students who borrowed money to attend vocational schools which provided inadequate education and few job prospects. <p>

Neither universities nor private lenders would have, on their own, permitted the student loan crisis. The key ingredient was Congress, which insisted that the real decisions about who would receive the student loans would be made by the federal government. This is one instance of how the federal government's attempts to direct higher education have gone awry. I do not have time to present anything like a systematic account of the destruction Congress has wrought in this area in the last three decades, but I will try to give you a Cook's tour of the most monumental follies. Our first stop has been the Great Converge,  formerly known as the Great Divide. Rivers once flowed east and west from this point. Institutions, ideas, and people went their separate ways. But Congress, through some elegant diversions, has now ensured that everything flows to Washington. <p>

I should also like to suggest some ways in which these monuments to folly can be replaced with the verdant fields and pleasant vistas of good sense. In the case of federally insured student loan programs, good sense points in one clear direction. The programs should again be made commercially viable. The exemptions for those institutions which are allowed to exceed the 25 percent default rate should be abolished, and the tolerated default rate should be lowered to a commercially acceptable level. No student who is not a high school graduate or who has not passed a high school equivalency examination should be  considered qualified for federally insured student loans. <p>

New educational institutions or ones which have exceeded the default rate threshold should be required to put up an insurance bond to protect against future loan defaults. I would add to this that tuition refund regulations should be clearly defined; the current state of confusing formulae leads to abuse. <p>

We should take a close look at the patterns of abuse and respond accordingly. Physicians, for example, are close to the top in the rankings of those who default on student loans. This could be corrected almost overnight by barring Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to doctors who default on their student loans and who fail to make amends within one year. That principle can be extended. Loan recipients who default and fail to make amends within one year should be barred from receiving any federal funds or contracts. <p>

These initiatives will return student loan programs to what was originally intended:  expanded educational opportunity at modest cost. In 1970, the taxpayer's bill for guaranteed student loans was $2.3 million on a volume of $770 million. In 1993, the bill had grown to $5 billion on a volume of $18 billion. Adjusted to 1993 dollars, the cost to taxpayers per  dollar loaned has risen from about .28 cents in 1970 to 28 cents in 1993. That is a 9,900 percent increase. <p>

If we knew then what we know now, or if the clock could be turned back thirty years,  perhaps we would not choose to go down the road of federally insured student loans. In that case, there would be far fewer colleges and universities, and there would be far fewer students at those which remained. But this is like wishing for a United States with an agrarian economy. We can't undo the past. This society has made a commitment to mass higher education. The attempt to reel in the percentage of the young who attend college to a European or Japanese level is not politically feasible, even in the unlikely event that we   decided it would be a good idea. <p>

Besides, as we have seen, there are simple ways in which the federally insured student loan crisis can be -- and should have been -- solved. Unfortunately, Congress and the Department of Education had an entirely different idea. They responded by adding yet more bureaucratic regulation and by making the programs even less commercially viable. The most intrusive part of this misguided response involves university and college accreditation. <p>


I approach this topic with a little trepidation. H.L. Mencken once called the Bible Belt "the Sahara of the Beaux Arts."  Accreditation is something like the Death Valley of the life of the mind. It is a dusty plain, leagues below the sea level of normal human cogitation, inhabited by scorpions and sidewinders. I could tell tales of college administrators stranded in this desperate landscape and languishing after mirage oases labeled "the assessment movement" and "teaching portfolios."  But that's for another time. What I am concerned with now is the invasion of the dirt-bikers. <p>

Accreditation at its best puts quacks out of business, but it is more typically a technique used by professional interests to feather their own nests. The most egregious example is the American Bar Association, which has a stranglehold on American legal education. Many of the ABA accreditation rules have only gossamer connections to the quality of legal education, but all of them have a laser-like focus on the perquisites of being a law professor -- down to specifying the number of square feet in each faculty member's office. You can get a fair picture of the world of specialized accreditation by imagining 250 or so would-be ABAs, each carping for a finer grade of ivory in its part of the tower. <p>

When all is said and done, however, we university administrators have a certain grudging respect for the specialized accreditors. Some know their business, and at worst they are driven by old-fashioned greed. In any case, specialized accreditors do not come close to the other great branch of academic accreditation, the regional accreditation agencies, for exemplifying lassitude, incompetence, and day-to-day bewilderment, combined with a solemn sense of rectitude and, of course, a desire to augment their authority. I realize that that description could apply rather well to several government agencies, but the regional accreditation agencies are not -- or not quite -- part of government. They are part of that shadowy world of quasi-governmental agencies which enjoy governmental authority but are largely unaccountable. <p>

The six regional accreditation agencies, which accredit whole institutions rather than   specific programs, gain their prominence from the stipulation that only accredited colleges and universities can participate in federal financial aid programs, including the Title IV    student loan programs. <p>

In 1992, when Congress recognized that default rates had gotten out of hand, it observed, correctly, that some of the worst offenders were schools that it had exempted from the   loan-default rate ceilings, along with a small number of proprietary schools. You and I could probably think of several solutions to this problem. I've sketched some of those earlier. But it's unlikely that in our most demented fantasies we would come up with the particular answer that Congress wrote into the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992. Instead of merely shutting off the spigot to the offending institutions, Congress decided to turn the      regional accreditation agencies into an enforcement wing of the Department of Education. <p>

Instead of isolating problem institutions and kicking them out of the program, it told accreditation agencies that they would be responsible for fixing the problem, on pain of losing their ability to operate. This brings us to our current pass, in which the Department of Education and several of the accreditation agencies, operating under the curious but imposing title "The National Policy Board," have developed a proposal to nationalize accreditation. <p>

The arid landscape of accreditation is now roaring with joy-riding regulators, the dirt-bikers of Death Valley. Again, the solution is common sense. Congress must intervene to keep government from taking over accreditation. The linkage between accreditation and the    Department of Education must be broken, and the government-mandated monopoly of    accreditation agencies should be abolished. <p>

I can think of several very concrete things Congress could do to bring some sanity back to this process. First, Congress should change the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that higher education accrediting agencies themselves be accredited. This requirement is at the bottom of DOE's attempt to take over accreditation and of the National Policy Board's attempt to nationalize the system. <p>

Accreditation agencies should be, in effect, accredited by their customers. If they have anything worthwhile to offer colleges and universities, colleges and universities will pay them for it. Generally, colleges and universities will pay to be reviewed by the agency which has the strictest standards that the institution thinks it can pass. A free market in accreditation agencies will quickly stratify, with the toughest agencies attracting the best colleges and universities. The public will benefit from a genuine ranking system. <p>

Congress should eliminate the link between accreditation and eligibility for federal funds, including federally guaranteed student loans (Title IV). Accreditation should be about the quality of academic programs, not about the rate at which students default on government-backed loans. <p>

Congress should also stipulate that the Department of Education has no role to play in   accrediting institutions of higher education. The DOE has made clear that it is not a good judge on issues of academic quality, and the prospect of its telling others how to promote academic quality is grimly amusing. <p>

Let us leave Death Valley. I have a great deal of hope that the current Congress will undo the mischief of years past, but it is a vast and bleak landscape, and relief is long overdue. The next stop on this tour is the Old Growth Forest, a place of deep calm, even torpor, where the government has decided there will be no harvesting of even the most mature trees. The Old Growth Forest lies in pleasant Tenure County. The deep calm exists because those who live there know that no matter how feeble their performance, how desultory their efforts to keep up with the times, and how pressing the need to start new seedlings, Congress has determined they can stay put so long as they can breathe. <p>

As of January 1994, universities and colleges are no longer permitted to have a mandatory retirement age for faculty. This intrusion into the terms of faculty employment nominally makes professors like workers in any other sector of the economy. But in reality, it does nothing of the kind, because no other part of the economy is encumbered with the tenure system. This law has effectively given tenured faculty a lifetime appointment. <p>

The problem clearly has two sides. Universities and colleges should be seeking ways to  reform or abolish tenure. The traditional legs on which tenure stands are economic security and academic freedom. Economic security is a fine thing, but in universities it should never trump competence. And the major threats to academic freedom today come not from a repressive society but from repressive ideologies espoused mostly by those who live under the cover of tenure. Boston University successfully abolished tenure in its Medical and  Dental Schools in 1973, and we have been making some inroads in other areas since, most recently by offering some faculty members long-term contracts instead of tenure. It is,   however, a hard nut to crack. A single institution has to have powerful attractions to recruit individuals who have the possibility of guaranteed lifetime employment at a competing institution. <p>

By outlawing mandatory retirement for faculty, the government is making the effort to eliminate tenure even more difficult, and it is -- inadvertently -- closing opportunities for many other people. The life of most senior faculty members is generally not so strenuous. Many faculty members are willing to keep going in the absence of a stick or a carrot that gives them some incentive to stop. The result is that there is less turnover and fewer positions for faculty members who are attempting to establish their careers. <p>

 The Old Growth Forest is getting older. Congress must repeal the law which prohibits universities and colleges from setting mandatory retirement ages for faculty. <p>

The enxt stop on our tour is the High Plateau, the setting for a wonderful new institution, Learning Disabled University. LDU got its start from laws designed to prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are being used -- perhaps contrary to legislative intention, but nonetheless -- to force colleges and universities to lower academic standards. <p>

Children are now reaching college having been swaddled for years in the comforting illusions of learning disabled theory. Enormous numbers of students in grade school and high school have been diagnosed "learning disabled."  In Massachusetts, almost one in five      students is crammed into this category. The national average is twelve percent. Are we in the midst of a silent genetic catastrophe? <p>

LDU is trying to keep LD philosophy students safe from the perplexities of Aristotle, to accommodate foreign language majors who have foreign language phobia, and to comfort physics students who suffer from dyscalculia, which is, of course, the particular learning   disablement that prevents one from learning math. <p>

I do not wish to imply that Boston University has escaped all the moonbeams illuminating campuses coast to coast. A month or so ago, I discovered that our Office of Disability Services had, without permission, begun issuing exemptions from the language and math  requirements on precisely the bases I described. I put a stop to it, and now I await as intrepidly as a brewer of hot coffee the lawsuits that are sure to follow. I think, for example, of the suit against Tufts University, filed by a student who claimed that Tufts was required  under the ADA to accommodate her psychological disability, which consisted of an aversion to taking tests. <p>

Nor do I wish to mislead you by suggesting that Learning Disabled University is entirely the province of students and their LD counselors. I think, for example, of the former philosophy professor that Boston University fired after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting another faculty member and of forcing his attentions on three undergraduate students. He responded with the novel defense that his lecherous behavior was the result of a disability:  namely, inhibitions chronically lowered by his ingestion of prescription drugs. He is now   suing Boston University, claiming that his behavior was protected by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. <p>

The disability laws are sacred cows, but they must at the very least be tethered so that they cannot be used to force universities to lower academic and other standards. <p>

My tour of follies in higher education has concentrated on sites that have benefited, so to speak, from Congress's helping hand. The Great Converge of student loan programs, the Death Valley of accreditation, the Old Growth Forest of mandatory retirement, and the High Plateau, home to Learning Disabled University, could not have become what they are without the wise counsel of Congresses past. <p>

I am conscious that in this speech I have been finding a great deal of fault with existing  arrangements. Burke, whom I referred to before, also observed that "those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation.... By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little."  In fact, I do not think I am    habitually employed in finding fault; this is a rather special occasion. <p>

Also, by concentrating on the evils brought on higher education by the government, I do not mean to suggest that only government can solve the problems it has created. Boston University, for example, has a number of initiatives which show how universities can help get government off the back of higher education. <p>

We have sought to lessen our dependence on federal research funding through Boston University's Community Technology Foundation, a venture capital fund established to develop the commercial potential of the work of our own researchers. We have invested about $60 million in Seragen, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company based on a breakthrough by a researcher in our Medical School. Seragen is currently in Stage III Clinical   Trials for a promising treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <p>

Disregarding Conrad's advice yet again, I must also note that Boston University has received several large federal grants -- earmarked funds, if you will -- which paid part of the costs of very expensive science and engineering facilities on our campus. The Heritage Foundation is a place where one does not expect such a statement to be met with resounding applause, but I mention it for good reason. Our nation's universities are one of its major sources of commercially developable ideas and patents. The nation as a whole stands to gain a great deal economically and in other ways by treating some universities, in some respects, like venture capital firms. The public should invest in those who have the energy, the  know-how, and the overall promise to deliver -- and then wait and see. Government micromanagement of research grants is wasteful. Perhaps paradoxically, and certainly contrary to the assumptions of many, pork barrel projects often give the public its best return. <p>

That's my apostasy for the day. Boston University has taken some other steps that I am more confident you will agree are in the right direction. We have shown it isn't necessary to take a laissez-faire attitude toward drugs, toward uncivilized behavior in the dorms, and     toward bully-boy political behavior on the streets in order to attract students. <p>

We have shown that it is still possible to have a university that isn't kidding when it says that its principal mission is the pursuit of truth. <p>

I observed at the outset that leaving a child at college for the first time leaves a parent with some anxiety. I rather facetiously compared that to the anxiety a university administrator feels entrusting to the DOE the mounds of make-work the federal government now demands of us. There is, however, a more serious side to this anxiety. Most children learn to live responsibly with the freedom of campus life as a prelude to the responsibilities of full adulthood. With some trepidation, parents grant their children the independence to live up to the challenges. <p>

We'd like a government that has at least that much faith in its citizens. American higher education is one of this country's most outstanding accomplishments. A federal government that is prudently supportive is all we need. Most things we can do better on our own. <p>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Crime:</B></FONT><P>
Aside from a handful of federal responsibilities, most criminal justice issues are a local matter and the Congress in Washington should let state and local governments deal with them.  If the Congress wants to do more about crime, it should lift the federal tax burden on the states and let them raise money for law enforcement and prisons.  I'm in favor of truth-in-sentencing, but I think John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Bill Weld, and the other governors can run their own prison systems.  If Members of Congress want to set the length of state prison sentences, they ought to resign and run for state legislator.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Drug Legalization:</B></FONT><P>
The last thing we should do is make drugs legal.  That would only make them more available, dramatically increase the number of babies born having been exposed to drugs when their mothers were pregnant, increase the number of children and coworkers who use drugs, and make it almost impossible for addicts to quit.  We made great strides in the late 1980s in reducing drug use and we should keep at it.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  America 2000 v. Goals 2000:</B></FONT><P>
We need to send education back to states, communities and families -- where it belongs.  That was the idea behind America 2000.  The Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 goes in exactly the opposite direction.  They've turned a national movement into a federal program.<P> 
	* America 2000 was all about encouraging high standards in the core academic subjects.  Goals 2000 is about how much is spent on education.<P> 
	* America 2000 was about making schools more accountable for their performance.  Goals 2000 makes it harder to know how well schools are doing.<P>
	* America 2000 sought to give all families more choices of all schools.  Goals 2000 creates more obstacles for choice.<P>
<HR WIDTH=30%> 
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  The Federal Role:</B></FONT><P>
Abolish the Department of Education in order to liberate parents and schools.  On January 26, I testified before the U.S. Congress and argued that it should take each activity currently housed in the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) send it home to states and communities; (b) entrust it to another federal agency; or (c) terminate it and return the money to the taxpayers.  I've been looking at this issue for more than 15 years and I am convinced that the people in a position to know what is best for education are those closest to the child.  Education policy should be geared toward giving parents and teachers more control over what goes on in the classroom.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Gun Control:</B></FONT><P>
I have never thought gun control equalled crime control.  If we are really interested in controlling crimes involving guns, we should have stricter penalties against those who commit the crimes.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Health Care Reform:</B></FONT><P>
Our health care system is still in need of repair.  When President Clinton tried to fix it last year, he went in exactly the wrong direction:  a "one size fits all" plan, run by Washington, D.C., full of new rules, mandates, and penalties.  We shouldn't repeat his mistakes.  We need to involve all 50 governors to help advance some important reforms state-by-state.  A few basic insurance reforms would make health insurance more flexible and easier to keep when we change jobs or move.  We should also amend the tax code so that individuals who buy health insurance get the same break that companies and their employees now receive.  It is also time we started looking at medical IRAs, the most direct way of giving individuals control over their own health care costs.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>History Curriculum Standards Sponsored by the Administration:</B></FONT><P>
They are not standards Lynne Cheney and I had in mind when we encouraged school boards to adopt voluntary educational standards. The history panel ended up presenting a warped view of our nation's past.  President Clinton should condemn these standards and make sure they are not promulgated or endorsed by the federal government.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Medicaid:</B></FONT><P>
We would save money -- and deliver better medical care to the poor -- if we capped the growth of spending but gave governors the power to run Medicaid as they see fit.
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to reform Medicaid is the welfare "swap."  President Reagan tried a version of this in the early 1980s. The first step is to give the states complete responsibility  for welfare in exchange for the federal government picking up a comparable portion of state Medicaid expenditures.  The second step is to delegate responsibility for administering the program back to the states without the mandates from Washington.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>School Prayer:</B></FONT><P>
I signed a bill permitting a moment of silence in schools in 1981 and I would sign one again today.  We should remember that on the first day of the very first session of Congress, the House and the Senate adopted the Bill of Rights.  On the second day, they adopted a national day of prayer called "Thanksgiving."
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Welfare:</B></FONT><P>
Instead of fixing welfare in Washington for the sixth time, we should end welfare reform in Washington. Let's end welfare as a federal program and send responsibility for it back to the states, communities, and private agencies.  States are way ahead of Washington on this one.  Michigan requires all welfare recipients to get a job, go to school, or do volunteer community service.  Wisconsin says two years and you're out.  Massachusetts says 60 days.  California docks welfare checks when kids don't go to school.  New Jersey doesn't pay more to mothers on welfare who have more children.  I would add:  no marriage penalty, no added benefits for children born to unmarried mothers on welfare, a certain end to payments to able-bodied adults after a set time, jail time for deadbeat dads, no payment to anyone who commits a crime while on welfare, reduction of welfare for parents whose children quit school, privatize job finding programs.

<b>David Sacks and Peter Thiel</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number74</i></center><p>
	Recent revelations in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>'s annual college guide that the cost of a top undergraduate degree now exceeds $100,000 may represent a watershed. At more than $25,000 a year, many students and their families will have to think hard about whether an Ivy-League education is worth the expense. For some parents, the answer will be to send their capable child to a less prestigious university or college for about $50,000 less. Most parents, however, will decide to scrimp, save, and sacrifice -- and perhaps take out a second mortgage on their home -- rather than turn down that rare admission offer from a Harvard, Yale, Brown, or Duke.<p>	By no means unrepresentative of what is meant by a "prestige" school is Stanford University, consistently ranked in the top five in <i>U.S. News</i>'s survey and privileged by an ideal climate, sumptuous facilities, and a $2-billion endowment. The yearly competition for admission reflects this status: More than 15,000 applicants vie for 1,600 places in the freshman class. A year there does not come cheaply: $25,749 for tuition, room, and board -- about the cost of a new BMW 325i.<p>	For almost every year in the last two decades, Stanford's tuition increases have outpaced inflation and, more importantly, the rate of personal income growth in the United States. The increases primarily fund what Gerhard Casper, Stanford's president, has called a "mini-welfare state" -- an ever-expanding range of student services and new programs centered around the university's multicultural "experiment." In the 1980s, then-president Donald Kennedy declared that Stanford's multicultural venture was "a bold experiment that must succeed," and the university began spending with a vengeance to make sure it did.<p>	To administer its great experiment, Stanford employs nearly 7,000 staffmore than one bureaucrat for every undergraduate -- including a $50,000-a-year "Multicultural Educator." (By contrast, there are only 1,400 faculty members.) And there is a large assortment of new m
ulticultural departments (feminist studies, African-American studies, Chicano studies, Asian-American studies, Native-American studies), ethnic centers, "residential education" (which receives more than $3 million a year), and new classes and conferences. In 1991, the university established an Office for Multicultural Development as a cabinet-level department and invested it with sweeping powers to ensure the university's "transformation."<p>	You can't achieve transformation on the cheap. Stanford raised tuition by 5 percent this year, 7.5 percent a year ago, and a whopping 9.5 percent for the 1992-93 school year. A record two-thirds of undergraduates (and an even higher percentage of graduate students) now receive some form of financial aid. However generous this aid, the squeeze invariably falls on parents or the students themselves. And much of it is unnecessary: Last year, the <i>Stanford Review</i> examined the 1993-94 university budget for ways to cut costs and reduce tuition. The <i>Review</i> identified $10 million in savings by merging scaled-back gender- and race-studies departments with other programs. The paper saved an additional $1 million by eliminating "multicultural dorm programming." All told, the Review produced a plan to reduce Stanford's tuition by about 14 percent by trimming multicultural programs.<p>It would be welcome. Explains Patrick Callahan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy Center, "There is close to a middle-class panic in this country from increases in tuition by private and public institutions."<p>Such fear is hardly overblown. In the trendy world of academia, which covets the latest politically correct program like a shiny new hood ornament, there is competition to keep up with the Stanfords. Yet Stanford's tuition ranks only 41st of 106 private colleges and universities surveyed by Cambridge Associates. <p>Many parents may be shocked to learn that the extra expense has not increased the quality of a undergraduate degree at Stanford, but rather ha
s undermined it. Students can still receive first-rate training in engineering, the sciences, and economics, where results are more testable. But many humanities and social science students will find themselves awash in courses that trivialize logical thinking and seem incapable of taking history, ideas, or truth seriously.<p>The curriculum boasts of literature courses that filter Shakespeare through the lens of lesbianism, American history courses that find no time to teach about the Constitution, English classes that require students to write grant proposals for environmental groups, and psychology courses that give high marks for finding "gender discrepancies" in pizza parlors. In short, much of the undergraduate humanities curricula has been transformed into a vehicle for shameless politicization and indoctrination. Parents of these youngsters may begin to wonder why they didn't just keep the money and open up their very own McDonald's franchise.<p><b>The New Classics</b><p>With the now-notorious chant "hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture's got to go," Stanford's activists demanded in 1987 that the core reading list be dumped in order to make room for a new curriculum. Ever since the university capitulated to these demands, the humanities have been undergoing a quiet revolution. As a start, consider the multiple-track "Cultures, Ideas, and Values" (CIV) program, the relativist 15-unit requirement (about $8,000 per student) that replaced the Western Culture core:<p><ul>
<li>Required reading in the Philosophy CIV track includes works by Chief Seattlethe 19th-century Indian leader whose alleged writings were later judged to be just of a pale face. Although the instructors have retained Plato and Aristotle, they primarily use them to contrast the "logocentrism" of Western philosophers with the more holistic approach of Australian Aborigines (whose unwritten "philosophy" is explained by Western anthropologists). One of the class's feminist instructors, Carol Delaney, teaches that the American role in World War II is "phallocentric" because men invented the atomic bomb without women. She compares the Manhattan Project to Frankenstein, both evil attempts to thwart women's role in the reproductive process.<p><li>The Bible is still read in all the CIV tracks, but many classes teach that Genesis is rife with sexism, and some sections even make the Apostle Paul politically correct by saying he may have been homosexual. Shakespeare is also still studied in all the tracks, but <i>The Tempest</i> is now viewed from a "slave perspective" and is made to serve as a case study in Western imperialism.</ul><p>
	Although CIV is perhaps the single biggest waste of student tuition, it represents just the tip of the scandal. Multiculturalism has overrun most of the major humanities and social-sciences departments. The cumulative effect has been a kind of institutionalized silliness. Consider just some of the more blatant examples:<ul>
<p><li>"Black Hair as Culture and History," one of the new multicultural history seminars, addressed how black hair "has interacted with the black presence in this country, and how it has played a role in the evolution of black society." Lectures included "The Rise of the Afro" and "Fade-O-Rama, Braiding and Dreadlocks," and local hair stylists were brought in for a week of discussions. Enrolled students viewed the 1960s musical <i>Hair</i> and read the lyrics to Michael Jackson's hit single "Man in the Mirror." "I couldn't have taught this class 10 years ago," Kennell Jackson explains. "But people don't look at me like I'm crazy anymore. What history does has broadened considerably."<p>
<li>History 267, "The History of Rights in the United States," was so busy extolling 1960s protest ("rights") movements that the class never even studied the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.<p>
<li>"19th-Century American History," taught by Estelle Freedman, devoted half of class time to a study of women, because they had constituted half the U.S. population during that time. As a result of these priorities, the class did not have enough time to learn about the War of 1812. <p><li>"Religions in America," a religious-studies class that can satisfy three different graduation requirements, devoted whole lectures to Shamanism, the peyote cult, and the Kodiak sect, but not one to the Catholic Church. When discussed at all, Christianity was viewed from a feminist or gay "perspective" through such works as <i>Jesus Acted Up: A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto</i>, <i>A Second Coming Out</i>, and <i>Beyond the Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women's Liberation</i>.<p>
<li>Anthropology 1 (which can also fulfill three different graduation requirements) devoted lectures to "language imperialism" and criticized CNN for the phenomenon because the network broadcasts in English to non-English-speaking countries.<p><li>In Psychology 167D, students received academic credit for becoming "contraceptive peer counselors" and for demonstrating these skills by placing condoms on a plastic penis at dorm meetings. <p>
<li>In Stanford's mandatory freshman English classes, students are required to write grant proposals for their professors' favorite community-service agencies, including homeless advocacy projects, AIDS support groups, and environmental action leagues. Instead of focusing on reading and writing skills, these classes revolve around the "Community Service Writing Project," which assigns freshmen to such activities as answering telephones at Stanford's Center for Public Service and visiting East Palo Alto elementary schools. <p><li>Enrolling more than 100 students each quarter, Linguistics 73 is one of the most heavily subscribed courses fulfilling Stanford's new race-studies requirement. Entitled "African-American Vernacular English," the premise of the class is that inner-city slang (of the type heard in rap songs) is a legitimate dialect of the English language deserving scholarly attention.<p>
<li>"Interdisciplinary" courses provide the opportunity for politicization along several vectors. One example is "Peace Studies," taught by faculty from the departments of sociology, political science, psychology, history, and education. The class begins by defining "peace" as "collaborative well-being," a euphemism for a smorgasbord of the lecturers' pet policy choices -- nationalized health care, government-guaranteed employment, transfer payments to inner cities, radical feminism, and so forth -- all taught under the rubric of "peace." Meanwhile, the curriculum completely omitted the study of the origins of World War I, World War II, the War for Independence, or any other significant historical conflagrations. The Vietnam War and Gulf War were reviewed briefly, but only as they related to the "peace movement" and its (often unpacific) protests. The class's final lecture was entitled "Peace and You," in which the course's lecturers fondly recounted their own 1960s activism and exhorted students to join the "peace movement" and "to act responsibly and effectively on behalf of peace."<p><li>Comparative Literature 189, "Representing Sappho: the Literature of Lesbianism," sought, in the words of Terry Castle, "to resexualize lesbian history." Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i> was identified as a "<i>locus classicus</i> of lesbianism," and the remainder of the course readings -- books both new and old -- were probed for "male and female representations of lesbian desire" and for "lesbianism as 'symbolist,' 'decadent,' 'modernist,' and 'utopian' literary motif."</ul><p>Other courses addressing human sexuality:<p>
<ul>
<li>Feminist Studies 295, "How Tasty Were My French Sisters"; Comparative Literature 110, "The Politics of Desire: Representations of Gay and Lesbian Sexuality"; and Law 587, "The History and Politics of Sexual Orientation: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives."<p>
<li>"Representing Sexualities: Whitman to AIDS" (English 187D) is another of Stanford's X-rated English classes. The course syllabus warns that "sexually explicit materials, both hetero- and homoerotic, may be viewed and discussed in this class." Readings included articles entitled "A Posttranssexual Manifesto," "Capitalism and Gay Identity," "From Thoreau to Queer Politics," and "How to Bring Your Kids up Gay," in addition to two videos, "Voices from the Front," by the militant homosexual group ACT-UP, and "Tongues Untied," a pornographic gay film. Jay Grossman spent his first class session presenting an episode of the television comedy <i>Cheers</i> and then deconstructing the show as "homophobic." His first reading assignment was several weeks of a cartoon strip in which a teenage character reveals that he is gay. In Stanford's English department, if the material is trendy enough, it does not even have to be literature.<p>
<li>Psychology 116, "The Psychology of Gender," is based on the premise that gender discrimination is everywhere, and so, not surprisingly, the class tends to find it everywhere. In her Spring 1994 class, Laura Carstenson required students to complete a group research project. Her favorite project was entitled "Gender Discrepancies in Pizza Consumption." The student authors first conducted their laborious research by "observing couples eating at a local pizza restaurant and recording the number of slices each individual consumed," and concluded that "gender discrepancies exist not only in quantity, but also in rate of consumption." Because this class meets the new feminist-studies requirement, it is heavily enrolled each quarter; hundreds of students are enlisted in this kind of inane multicultural research. </ul><p>
Such anecdotes do not simply exist on the fringes of an otherwise terrific Stanford education. Many involve core classes that fulfill graduation requirements, subjects at the heart of a liberal-arts education. All students must take CIV and Freshman English. In addition, the university has imposed a number of "distribution requirements" (DRs) which can only be fulfilled by classes in certain areas. While there is no requirement in American History, for instance, all students -- including science majors -- are now required to take at least one course in feminist studies, one course on race theory, and one course on Third World cultures. There are three additional social-studies requirements, usually satisfied by classes from such departments as anthropology, English, and sociology where the multicultural revolution has been pushed furthest. "Psychology of Gender," "African-American Vernacular English," Anthropology 1, and "Religions in America" are all classes that fulfill Drs.<p>
	The DR system limits the flexibility of conscientious students who wish to avoid swallowing large quantities of academic junk food. Of the 180 units necessary for graduation, distribution requirements in new or revamped subjects like CIV, Freshman English, race studies, feminist studies, and multicultural social studies now constitute almost 60 units. As a result, even those students who pursue majors in economics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, or engineering will spend close to one-third of their four years at Stanford -- at a cost of about $25,000 per year -- studying thoroughly politicized multicultural requirements.<P>Just in case these requirements do not suffice, however, Stanford's multiculturalists provide powerful incentives to take their electives. The average grade in Stanford's humanities departments is above an A-. Many of the most radical multiculturalists are also radical egalitarians who give everyone As, so from a student's point of view their classes are not necessarily the ones to avoid. What student wouldn't be attracted to a class like Peace Studies, where a "take-home" midterm and an "open-book" final exam guarantee an easy A? Science majors are particularly prone to building "trophy transcripts" by taking multicultural courses whenever possible, because they face the stiffest competition in admission to graduate programs and medical schools. <p>For those students pursuing a degree in the humanities or social sciences, there are even fewer options. The numerous examples already mentioned -- all fairly indicative -- represent just the beginning of an indoctrination into New Age thinking. For these hapless students, being principled or conscientious about course selection simply does not make much difference: Instead of "Black Hair" or Feminist Studies 101, such a student might find himself in "19th-Century American History" or "History of Rights," where the course title falsely advertises the subject matter. While there are, of course, still many solid courses (and good teac
hers) at Stanford, especially in engineering and the hard sciences, Stanford's activists have largely succeeded in killing the core undergraduate humanities curriculum. <p><b>The Multicultural Waste Land</b><p>The death of the humanities at Stanford does not imply that institutions like it will serve no function whatsoever. In the hard sciences, economics, and engineering, our top colleges and universities will graduate people who have amassed an impressive array of scientific knowledge and technical skills. At the same time, business, law, and medical schools will continue to churn out trained professionals. From the outside perspective of companies seeking to hire new computer engineers, biochemists, or investment bankers, everything will continue as before.	<p>	But in the process, Stanford risks becoming a technical school, along the lines of MIT or Caltech -- highly esteemed in narrow areas of expertise and not much more. Behind the facade of normalcy, much may be lost. The university may be transformed into a multiversity, no longer capable of providing a universal framework for students to integrate a wide assortment of knowledge into a coherent whole. That kind of framework, so essential for thinking about the larger problems facing individuals and societies, simply cannot be provided by science; it must be gleaned from the humanities, and can be reached only after rigorous study -- in philosophy, literature, and history. <p>	Most students have only the vaguest notion of what some of the alternatives might be -- what Socrates, Jesus, or Jefferson said that might be relevant to the contemporary situation. They have only a minimal understanding even of the ideas that built the American regime. Most have not read John Locke or Adam Smith, much less <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville, or Abraham Lincoln. Though the loss of this framework cannot readily be translated into dollars and cents, it will be felt keenly nonetheless, by a generation of students increasingly alienated from an inc
oherent and senseless world, unable even to diagnose the source of their troubles.<p>The scope of this loss has been hinted at, indirectly, by one of Casper's most sweeping proposals. He has suggested replacing the four-year undergraduate degree with a three-year degree. His proposal is particularly heretical, because it suggests that students are not getting much added value out of a fourth year at Stanford and that the university's distribution requirements might need to be scrapped. "If resources were available, I'd say four years are wonderful, the more the better," he says. "On a cost-benefit analysis, there will be more questions as to whether these four years are sustainable in the long run." <p>In a narrow sense, Casper was clearly right: If there was no real humanities program left, then a three-year professional education would represent a sensible change. At the same time, however, the call for such a drastic remedy indicated how much had been lost and how little else could be done about this loss.<p>If higher education in America is not altogether finished, then perhaps it is in the midst of a massive and unprecedented displacement. An intellectual renaissance in our traditional centers of higher learning may be a long time coming, but this does not necessarily imply that people simply will stop thinking in the intervening years. To the extent that it continues, intellectual life will likely shift from elite universities to historically less significant colleges that have survived the multicultural transformation, or move altogether outside the academic context.<p>New educational venues may arise and meet demands no longer being satisfied by existing institutions. One promising area involves new computer networks in which people connect with one another from all parts of the country to discuss matters of common interest. Not surprisingly, a number of these networks focus on areas that no longer have much of a place in the multicultural academy, such as free-market economics or Thomistic theology
. Because learning need not take place in the classroom, this sort of technological breakthrough may in time undermine the near-monopoly on higher education currently enjoyed by America's elite universities.<p>Admittedly, that distant prospect offers small solace to students who are eager to attend prestigious schools like Stanford, but are hard pressed to find there academic mentors to guide them toward answers to ancient and modern questions: What constitutes justice, rather than political propaganda about the size of welfare payments; what the Bible teaches about man's political nature, rather than radical speculation about the Apostle Paul's sexual orientation; or the Founders' view of slavery and race relations, instead of courses on hairstyles. At $100,000 for a degree, is that really asking too much?

Lecture 536: Downsizing Government, by Senator Abraham
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 536</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and Seminars</h2></a>
<hr>
<h3>Downsizing Government:  Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3>
Senator Abraham addressed a meeting of The <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage">Heritage Foundation</a>'s Washington Policy Roundtable on July  26,  1995.
<p>
<br>
As the Co-Chair of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov/">Senate</a> sponsor of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our efforts to eliminate the <a href="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</a>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank The Heritage Foundation for putting forward detailed proposals for eliminating several Cabinet departments; many of your suggestions have found their way into the four Cabinet elimination bills that the task force has developed.
<p>
In my mind, no issue better symbolizes the dramatic changes that have occurred since the November elections than the ongoing efforts to eliminate departments of the federal government.  Just a year ago, members walking the halls of Congress were discussing the merits of making the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> a Cabinet-level department.  Today, Morton Kondracke is predicting on "The McLaughlin Group" that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the Department of Commerce will not be eliminated this year.  I don't agree with his prediction, but I like his choice of topics.
<p>
Our task force was set up to examine ways to dismantle four Cabinet departments:  Commerce, <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>. These four departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have combined budgets of $70 billion -- 133 times more than the entire federal government spent at the turn of the century. We must target these departments if we are truly to restrain the growth of government, reduce the tax burden on American businesses and workers, and balance the budget.
<p>
The goal of our task force is not simply to "zero out" these Cabinet departments, but rather to examine rational approaches to consolidate, privatize, and/or devolve back to the states their functions.  In our efforts, we adopted the following four principles as our guide:
<ul>
<p>
1) Those programs deemed unnecessary or wasteful are terminated;
<p>
2) Those programs duplicative of other departments or agencies are consolidated;
<p>
3) Those programs that serve a valid purpose are transferred to more appropriate agencies; and
<p>
4) Those programs which can be better performed outside the government will be privatized.
</ul>
<p>
By applying these guiding principles, our Cabinet proposals both reduce the federal spending on, and increase the effectiveness of the truly vital functions of, each department. 
<p>
Now let me turn to our efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department -- the only department slated for elimination in the congressional budget resolution.  As former Commerce Secretary Mosbacher notes, the department is "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  In my judgment, no other department better symbolizes the waste and duplication prevalent in the federal government than Commerce.
<p>
First, many of the department's functions are either duplicated or outperformed by other government agencies and private industry. Its own Inspector General notes that the department has evolved into a "loose collection of more than 100 programs," while the GAO states that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities," sharing its "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."
<p>
Second, its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and more than 60 percent of its resources are dedicated to noncommercial activities. For example, almost 60 percent of the department's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> -- the nation's weather and ocean mapping service.
<p>
Third, many of its programs are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.  A prime example is the notorious Economic Development Administration.  At some point in its history, 40 percent of the EDA's loans were in default, while economic assistance grants were being distributed to such economically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, Florida.  Even when it is effective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in other departments.
<p>
Today's Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented." Its problems can be solved only if it is dismantled. Using the four guiding principles I mentioned earlier, our Commerce legislation would do the following:
<p>
First, we would eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and wasteful programs such as the EDA, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a>.
<p>
Second, we would transfer the various functions of NOAA -- which comprises the lion's share of the department's budget -- to more appropriate agencies and departments, or to private institutions.  For example, seafood inspection would be transferred to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, which already carries out most food inspection programs.  Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be transferred to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/avads/index.html">Interior Department</a>, which already manages some fisheries.
<p>
Third, we would transfer many of the Commerce Department's trade programs to agencies where their functions may be better performed.  Nineteen distinct federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. exports, but only 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. Secretary <a href="http://www.doc.gov/misc/BrownBio.html ">Ron Brown</a> may argue that Commerce leads federal efforts at export promotion, but almost three-quarters of the export promotion funds go to the Department of Agriculture, not Commerce. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the very traits that make Commerce a likely target for elimination -- its hodgepodge of unrelated agencies -- also make navigating its elimination through the legislative process extremely difficult.  Commerce offers something for everyone, and our efforts have stepped on a lot of toes. In the end, however, I believe we will prevail for the simple reason that, while one can justify many of the programs under the Commerce umbrella, there is no justification for the umbrella itself.  It's an accident of political evolution, not the product of sound policy.
<p>
For that reason, dismantling the department presents us with the unique opportunity to rationalize many of the functions currently under its jurisdiction, including those functions related to trade.  Let me say at the outset that I am a big proponent of free and expanded trade.  During my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I endorsed the <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/nafta.html">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, a politically difficult position to take coming from an industrial state like Michigan.  In fact, I was the only candidate from either party to do so.  Expanded trade does increase American jobs and living standards.
<p>
Clearly, establishing contacts and building trade relationships is important.  But just how effective is the current structure of our federal trade programs?  Opposition to dismantling Commerce comes from two sources -- bureaucrats in the Department who stand to lose their power and prestige, and certain portions of the business community who are concerned about our proposed reforms of the department's trade functions. Their principal concern is that Commerce is essential to promoting American exports abroad.  In fact, in testimony before a House committee the other day, Secretary Brown claimed that the Commerce Department is a "job creator" that builds the economy by increasing exports.
<p>
You might have heard the claim that trade advocacy and counseling efforts by the Commerce Department "returned $10.41 to the federal Treasury for every dollar invested in export promotion."  According to the Department of Commerce, this number and others like it are based upon undefined estimates.  As the Heritage Foundation's Joe Cobb pointed out in testimony Monday before the House Commerce Committee, "estimate" means "made up." Other economists agree. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute and former economic advisor to Bill Clinton argues that there is "no economics" to the notion that export promotion creates jobs. Shapiro states, "All you can do with them is increase jobs for companies with the clout to get the subsidy. But that's at the expense of industries that don't have the clout. You're just shifting things around."
<p>
None of this is to say that the federal government has no role in promoting international trade.  My legislation begins the important process of consolidating our trade functions by transferring them to more appropriate agencies, thereby increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. As former Commerce official Wayne Berman points out, "You shouldn't negotiate open markets in one department and then try to exploit those open markets in another department. It ought to be a focused, well coordinated effort."
<p>
The Commerce Department Dismantling Act embraces this view by transferring over 70 percent of the International Trade Administration, including the Import Administration and the Foreign Commercial Service offices, to the USTR, creating one office where our trade agreements are negotiated and enforced.  In addition, the legislation creates a series of Industry Advisory Boards composed of representatives from the private sector to provide advice to policymakers and to ensure that industry has a "voice" in any administration.
<p>
Another trade-related agency my bill affects is the Bureau of Export Administration.  As it is currently situated, the Export Administration is criticized for two failings.  According to the defense community, it does a poor job of analyzing risks and protecting U.S. security interests.  Meanwhile, businesses criticize the Administration for being unresponsive to many requests by industry, often sitting on applications for extended periods of time instead of notifying the exporter of possible problems.
<p>
Given these criticisms, I see legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce as an opportunity to make the Export Administration more responsive through two basic reforms: First, setting a time limit for granting export licenses and second, formalizing, either legislatively or through report language, the inter-agency process by which licensing concerns are raised.  These two reforms would make the BXA a much more effective partner with businesses while protecting our national security.
<p>
In conclusion, let me say that the 104th Congress has a historic opportunity to stop the growth of government and move us toward the limited central government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Given this opportunity, it would be a tragedy if one of the flagship efforts of the new leadership, the effort to eliminate the Department of Commerce, is defeated.  It will be impossible, in my judgment, to successfully address the massive growth of government and balance the budget if we cannot even address dismantling this department and redesignating its core functions to other agencies.  If we lack the will to do this, it will be virtually impossible to implement the reductions in social service programs that will be necessary to achieve balance.
<p>
My point is this: If we cannot dismantle the Department of Commerce simply because 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion must be spent by the department, then where can we cut spending? In my judgment, if we don't dismantle one of the least defensible Cabinet departments, then we won't make the tough decisions to limit spending for other sympathy-engendering spending programs.
<p>
In closing, I believe the goals of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and those of American industry are the same -- limited government, efficient regulation, low taxes. In that sense, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is more than just a symbol for eliminating government waste;  it's a  key step in downsizing government for the benefit of all Americans. I hope that we can work together to make the elimination of this department a reality.

<title>Abolish The Department of Commerce -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Abolish the Department of  Commerce: <br>
Move the Undersecretary for International Trade to the Treasury Department</h3></i>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #425<br>
August 14, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>
	The legislation in Congress to dismantle the Department of Commerce (DOC) has raised concerns about how necessary functions currently performed by the department will be preserved. Business leaders in particular have expressed concern about protecting U.S. interests in international trade. Although the idea of creating a new Cabinet-level Department of International Trade is gaining momentum, it would not reduce the size of the Cabinet. Responding to the concerns of the business community about U.S. trade policy need not conflict with the initial goal of dismantling Cabinet agencies and reducing the size and scope of government. A more effective solution is to transfer international trade functions to the Treasury Department.
<p>
	<b>Re-examine the Initial Proposal.</b> Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act transfers international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees. It conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place more than 2,500 Commerce Department employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's role as a world economic leader, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports.
<p>
	The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation to establish a new U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, like the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
	Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. Insulating trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
	<b>Create an Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade.</b> Congress should transfer Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
	The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department now has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy, so the Secretary of Commerce is perceived abroad as a minor Cabinet officer. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring.
<p>
	To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements -- which is a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries -- the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department is currently responsible for all enforcement relating to taxation of transnational corporations, which has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department. As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct invoicing of these imports and exports both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.
<p>
	Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the administration.
<p>
	<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to a new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had not corrected a number of problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer -- without substantial reorganization -- of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<P>
	<B>What Congress Should Do.</B> Export and import concerns should continue to occupy a priority position in the President's Cabinet, and the role of the USTR should not be diminished by any administrative reorganization. Congress should reject any proposals to create a new Cabinet-level international trade department. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet and would not carry the same authority internationally as the Treasury Department. The American people would see through the "shell game" nature of any such exercise and question the commitment of Congress to reducing the size of government. The Clinton Administration would be handed a strong argument for vetoing the entire reorganization proposal. Establishing a new Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade responsible for all current functions of the Commerce Undersecretary would address these problems and strengthen the administration of U.S. trade policy.

<h3>First Step Toward Budget Sanity:<br> Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. federal government will spend an 
estimated $1.52 trillion.  By the year 2000, President Clinton's budget would see total outlays reach $1.91 trillion.  Even the more frugal House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution on the Budget -- Fiscal Year 1996 calls for spending to rise to $1.78 trillion by 2000.
<p>
This seemingly relentless march toward a $2-trillion federal budget 
needs to be halted.  The United States should be moving in the opposite direction -- downsizing the public sector and freeing up resources for productive, private-sector ventures.  A public-sector retreat -- making room for substantial tax cuts -- will allow the private sector and entrepreneurship to advance.  Real spending reduction means reversing course toward a $1-trillion federal government.
<p>
  Despite the cries from big-government and special-interest circles, much can be cut from the U.S. federal budget.  The Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, bloated welfare programs, and so many other areas of federal largess offer fertile ground for savings opportunities through considerable downsizing or outright elimination.  As the first major step, perhaps no other department deserves to be dismantled more than the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
<b>The Grand Delusion</b>
<P>
Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown recently declared: "The work of this department is essential to the economic growth and well-being of this country."1  The Secretary even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also declared that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Project would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  After all, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, a productive role for the government is limited to lowering trade barriers.  The Commerce Department should not be acting as the international marketing department for certain American businesses, with taxpayers, including other businesses, footing the bill.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
In addition to its bankrupt industrial-policy mission, the Commerce Department also serves as a "catch all" federal department.  It houses large governmental undertakings that have absolutely nothing to do with "commerce," such as the Bureau of the Census and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
<P>
<b>Commerce Budget</b>  
<P>
The taxpayers' price tag for the Commerce Department is by no means cheap.  Federal outlays for the Commerce Department in 1995 are estimated at $3.6 billion.  Figure 1 shows Commerce Department outlays since 1980 and Clinton Administration estimates for 1995 through 2000.
<P>
<b>Dismantling the Commerce Department</b>  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce 
offers a clear opportunity to save taxpayer dollars.  The Commerce Department should be closed, with most of its duties terminated or privatized, and the remaining moved to other departments.  
<ul>
<li> The Bureau of the Census and all other economic and statistical analysis functions at the Commerce Department, at the very least, should be moved into an independent statistical agency, along with other statistical and data-collection functions undertaken by the federal government.  
<p>
However, Jim Miller, former budget director under President Ronald Reagan, offers an intriguing alternative for the Bureau of the Census.  He notes that while the Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, it does not say a government agency has to perform it.  Why not contract it out to a private firm?2  
<p>
<li> All economic development, travel and tourism, and technology programs should be privatized if possible, or otherwise terminated, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration,  Technology Administration, the National Technical Information Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.
<p>
<li> End the federal government's roles as international marketing department for multinational firms, and a center for raising protectionist trade barriers against foreign goods.  The International Trade Administration should be closed.
<p>
<li> Legitimate trade activities -- such as negotiating, implementing, and enforcing free-trade accords -- should be moved to the Treasury Department.  The Bureau of Export Administration, though, with its responsibility for overseeing the export of goods that could impact national security, should be moved to the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li> The Patent and Trademark Office should be shifted to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li> As for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of this $2-billion behemoth should be privatized, with remaining duties shifted to other departments.  For example, the largest part of the NOAA's budget goes toward the National Weather Service.  Heritage Foundation economist Joe Cobb reports that roughly 300 private companies prepare and disseminate weather forecasts, with 85 percent of the American public receiving its weather forecasts from private meteorologists and for-profit companies.  The opportunity for substantial privatization is at hand.
</ul><P>
<p>
<b>A Revolution Needs Real Commitment.</b>  
<p>
The Republican Congress is sending out mixed signals on the Commerce Department.  Some only want to cut the Commerce budget, but leave the department in tact.  Others want to replace the Commerce Department with another, smaller cabinet-level agency, such as a Department of International Trade.  These half-measures should be abandoned.  
<p>
If our federal elected officials are serious about downsizing government, then the Commerce Department truly must be eliminated.  An inability to make the easy cuts -- like eliminating Commerce -- would bode ill for the more politically difficult, but clearly necessary cuts down the road.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a statement on July 26 declaring their "firm commitment to incorporate the [Commerce Department] dismantling legislation into the reconciliation bill."3  
<p>
This commitment to eliminate Commerce needs to be unequivocal if we are ever to bring some sanity back to the U.S. federal budget.  Otherwise, failure to kill the Department of Commerce would signal severe weakness and perhaps the end of a shortlived revolution.  <P><hr>

<br>
INTRODUCTION
<p>
The congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1996<i>1</i> calls for elimination of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). With its many sweeping changes, this resolution is both symbolic of the change in philosophy of this Congress and a very practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to dismantle the Department of Commerce,<i>2</i> and both the House Commerce Committee and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have held hearings.<i>3</i> The congressional leadership has indicated that the FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill will include language to close down the Commerce Department.<i>4</i>
<p>
The idea of closing the department comes entirely from Congress. The Administration's reinventing government initiative barely touches the Department of Commerce, which indeed cannot be "reinvented."  The proper course of action is to dismantle the agency, which is little more than a collection of disparate programs. The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments.
<p>
To close the department, obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated, and duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments. Commercial activities should be privatized or ended -- leaving private corporations to pay for their own research, advertising, and other costs of doing business.
<p>
Specifically, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration.
<p>
<li>Use the staff of the Inspector General as the core for the transition work but abolish the office upon completion of this work.
<p>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, with outstanding loans to be collected by the Treasury Department.
<p>
<li>Consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistics Administration, within a single new independent agency.
<p>
<li>Transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department.
<p>
<li>Close the domestic offices of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the Minority Business Development Agency.
<p>
<li>Close down the Travel and Tourism Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the major part of the Commerce Department -- to other Cabinet departments that perform similar functions and close down the NOAA Corps.
<p>
<li>Establish the National Weather Service as an independent agency, with commercial services privatized.
<p>
<li>Establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation.
<p>
<li>Close down the Office of Technology Policy (Technology Administration).
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology and transfer residual functions to the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and privatize electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
</ul>
A Cabinet department reporting directly to the President of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies. Defenders of the Commerce Department argue that its various activities are valuable and useful, but no case has been made that these functions cannot be performed in the private sector or elsewhere in government, or that they are more valuable than the budgetary resources consumed.
<p>
Because Commerce would be the first Cabinet department in U.S. history to be dismantled, the absence of clear precedents and procedure presents a challenge for the House and Senate task forces chaired by Representative Dick Chrysler (R-MI) and Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Title I of both their bills establishes a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. An administrator of this temporary agency, appointed by the President, would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function" according to "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency" that the President must submit to Congress within six months. The agency would have three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property.<i>5</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>THE "DEPARTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS AFFAIRS"</b>
<p>
According to its own Inspector General, Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."<i>6</i>  The General Accounting Office reports the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" and shares "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<i>7</i>
<p>
Most of the department's resources have little or no relation to its purported mission:  "encourag[ing], serv[ing], and promot[ing] the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement."<i>8</i>  For instance, nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget (about $2 billion per year) and some 37 percent of its staff are in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts a number of environmental programs, including weather-related activities and research programs in marine and atmospheric sciences. Meanwhile, export promotion programs are distributed among ten different federal agencies:  "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<i>9</i>
<p>
Not only are many of the department's other activities -- especially its commercial operations  questionable as federal functions, but most badly need modernization and capital investment. Due to political and budgetary pressures, much of its capital stock is in disrepair. The GAO reports that departmental infrastructure -- "federal laboratories, a fleet of ships, weather satellites and radar, information systems, and other facilities and equipment -- will require investments of at least $7.4 billion over a 15-year period."<i>10</i>  The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>11</i>
<p>
The Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented."  The optimal course of action is indicated by the congressional budget resolution:  The department should be dismantled. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments, and its commercial activities should be privatized or closed.
<p>
The following analysis examines each organizational unit in the Commerce Department and recommends how to terminate or transfer its activities. For reference, data from the President's budget<i>12</i> are included in tables at the head of each section, with full-time employment levels and budget outlays in millions of dollars for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. In addition, major programs are detailed with obligated spending in millions of dollars.
<p>
<br>
<b>Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration</b><br>
The position of Commerce Secretary was established in 1913 when Labor was separated from the original Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established in 1903. The new agency was supposed to foster modern industrial production, rather than agriculture (which already enjoyed its own Cabinet department for 41 years). 
<p>
The Secretary of Commerce often is portrayed as the advocate of pro-business policies in a President's cabinet.<i>13</i> But public policy decisions affecting business generally are not made in the Commerce Department. Rather they come from such agencies as the President's Economic Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Commerce, in recent administrations, has served more often as an important fund-raiser for his President's election campaigns than as the architect of policies to help the nation's commerce.
<p>
</b>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
The administrative and coordination functions of the Secretary of Commerce and supporting bureaus under his immediate authority should be assigned to a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency, as provided in Title I of the legislation introduced by Representative Chrysler and Senator Abraham. The President would submit to Congress within six months "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency," and an administrator appointed by the President would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function."  This temporary agency would have no more than three years to execute the legislative mandate:  terminating programs, reassigning civil service personnel, and disposing of surplus property.<i>14</i>
<p>
<b>Inspector General</b><br>
The Office of Inspector General was established in 1978 to provide agency-wide audits and investigations and to recommend corrections for waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b> 
<p>
Congress should close the Office of Inspector General, although its personnel could form the core staff for the temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency established by the Chrysler-Abraham legislation.
<p>
<b>Economic Development Administration</b><br>
During the Johnson Administration, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 established a program of grants and other financial assistance to targeted cities and rural regions identified as "economically distressed."  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) also operates the Revolving Loan Fund, lending money to state and local governments that they in turn lend to businesses. The EDA will spend roughly $362 million in fiscal 1995 and $401 million in fiscal 1996.<i>15</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should close down the Economic Development Administration and direct the U.S. Treasury to collect all outstanding loans.<i>16</i> Congress approved $408 million in EDA spending for fiscal 1995, including $202 million for public works, $26 million in planning grants, $120 million for defense economic conversion, and $45 million in economic adjustment grants.<i>17</i> The EDA's development functions duplicate the activities of programs within the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.<i>18</i> On these grounds alone the program should be terminated.
<p>
Throughout the EDA's history, grants have been used by Members of Congress to distribute favors to constituents by "earmarking" funding to projects, bypassing the formal hearing process. This often means EDA grants go to locations with healthy economies that do not need federal assistance. In fact, the 17 states represented by the members of the relevant House and Senate subcommittees received $1.10 per capita in EDA grants during 1994, compared with 68 cents per capita in those states without representation, despite the fact that the average unemployment rate for the states represented was only 5.2 percent, compared with the national average of 5.4 percent that year.
<p>
The pork-barrel projects funded in the FY 1995 appropriation bill include:
<p>
<b>Egegik, Alaska.</b> The small fishing village of Egegik, with a population of 101, rests on the western shore of Alaska. Egegik has a per capita income of nearly $20,000 and is home to 23 families with an average family income of more than $60,000. Yet, in 1994, EDA granted the village $826,000 for the construction of a public dock. This is the equivalent of $8,178 for every person in Egegik.
<p>
<b>Key Biscayne, Florida.</b> A town of 8,854 residents, Key Biscayne is located in the middle of one of the most popular vacation spots in the country. Taking advantage of its beautiful climate and year-round influx of tourists, the local population enjoys a per capita income of more than $37,500. Yet Key Biscayne was awarded a 1994 EDA grant of $750,000 for the installation of a storm sewer system.
<p>
<b>St. Cloud, Minnesota.</b> St. Cloud University was awarded $91,512 in 1994 for the rehabilitation of its university center. According to EDA guidelines, these centers "must focus on service areas with significant economic distress."<i>19</i>  But this area hardly qualifies as distressed; St. Cloud has an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent and an above-average per capita income. Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.2 percent, the fourth lowest in the nation.
<p>
Almost all federal development programs, moreover, have proven to be expensive failures. Federal public works, job training, and regional development programs create few new jobs for the considerable amounts of money they cost to administer.<i>20</i> As a typical example, the General Accounting Office noted that no more than 35 percent of the beneficiaries of the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983 actually had been unemployed.<i>21</i> Another analysis suggested that only 84 previously unemployed people received jobs under the program at a cost of some $307,000 per job. The average private-sector job costs only about $40,000 to create.<i>22</i> Congress could do far more to spur economic development by closing down the EDA and using the savings to reduce the tax burden faced by private-sector employers, who are in a better position to create jobs.
<p>
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has  jurisdiction over the sections of the Commerce Department Dismantling Act that abolish EDA, voted instead on August 2 to support a measure that would preserve all of the pork barrel substance of the program.<i>23</i> It creates a new Undersecretary of Commerce and an Office of Economic Development to "replace" the current EDA and authorizes funding of $340 million per year for five years. Section 605 of the legislation even contains a provision to assure that EDA's functions will survive the elimination of the Commerce Department.
<p>
The proposed substitute bill adopts the model of the Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965 as a temporary response to poverty in 13 states, which today continues to provide highway construction grants and other financial aid to those states and local governments. The House committee not only reauthorized the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years, it created eight additional regional commissions as independent agencies, administering grants and loans for spending on government-financed projects. Up to 45 percent of the United States would qualify for pork barrel spending based on the following eligibility criteria:  per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; or an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period; or sudden and severe job loss; or "a pocket of poverty."<i>24</i>
<p>
This effort by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is extremely ill-advised. The proposal for a group of regional commissions to hand out grants and below-cost loans will only perpetuate and expand the unsound practices of subsidizing construction projects for political gain. 
<p>
<b>Bureau of the Census</b><br>
The Bureau of the Census was established as a permanent office in 1902. In addition to conducting the decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution, the bureau continuously gathers and tabulates a wide range of economic and demographic statistics.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer the U.S. Census Bureau to a new independent agency, a Bureau of National Statistics, which would house all data collection functions of the government. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood, in her recent <i>Organizing to Count:  Change in the Federal Statistical System,</i> puts forth a practical and detailed proposal for such reorganization.<i>25</i> A centralized statistical agency for the United States, similar to that of Canada, also was recommended in The Heritage Foundation's <i>Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America 26</i> and by the National Association of Business Economists.<i>27</i>
<p>
Section 207 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation would transfer the Census Bureau to the Treasury Department, which already performs substantial data collection in administering the Internal Revenue Code and collecting customs duties. The House and Senate task forces set out to reduce the size of government, not merely to rename existing bureaucracies (although Census would remain under their bill), so they call for no new independent federal agencies. But the benefits from establishing an independent Bureau of National Statistics are substantial. One of the most important would be to take statistical functions out of politicized bureaucracies and place them in an agency with no policy functions, thereby helping to insure that data collection is not influenced by political considerations.<i>28</i>
<p>
<b>Economics and Statistics Administration</b><br>
The Bureau of Economic Analysis was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1953. It reports to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who also oversees the Census Bureau. The two agencies together are known as the Economics and Statistics Administration, although the much larger Census Bureau is always identified separately. The agency draws upon the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and other data collection sources to compile the national income and product accounts and prepare forecasts and indicators of economic activity, widely followed by the news media and economists.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (along with the Census Bureau) within an independent Bureau of National Statistics, which would be responsible for all economic and demographic data collection and analysis for the federal government. Statistical functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health, and Labor also should be merged within the new agency.
<p>
Section 208 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation provides for transfer of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to the Federal Reserve System, which already performs substantial data collection as part of its banking regulation and monetary policy functions. As with the Census Bureau, sponsors are reluctant to establish any new federal agencies. The independent Federal Reserve, however, should not be assigned functions by Congress only tangentially related to its central role of monetary policy and policing the nation's payments system.
<p>
<b>International Trade Administration</b><br>
The International Trade Administration (ITA) was established in 1980 by the Secretary of Commerce and also encompasses the Bureau of Export Administration. The ITA is charged with promoting U.S. exports, both through "export promotion" advocacy and diplomatic intervention by Commerce officials. It also processes petitions by U.S. industries seeking antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory weapons to erect trade barriers against foreign producers and products.<i>29</i>
<p>
The Undersecretary for International Affairs also runs numerous other programs, such as the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service, which target a handful of industries for export development. The Undersecretary has a Deputy Undersecretary and a Director of Administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and three other Assistant Secretaries, plus the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (which has offices in 68 countries throughout the world as well as 47 district offices and 21 branch offices in the United States).
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer all Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, including direction of the Import Administration, Trade Development, and the Foreign Commercial Service (see chart above). The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy. Outside the United States, the Secretary of Commerce is perceived correctly as a minor Cabinet officer. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for U.S. currency exchange rates, U.S. policy in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and macroeconomic coordination among the G-7 industrialized countries. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring to the task.
<p>
To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements, a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries, the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department currently is responsible for all enforcement relating to matters involving taxation of transnational corporations, and this has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department.
<p>
As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct pricing of these imports and exports, both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.<i>30</i>
<p>
Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, which has been considered in hearings before the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, transfers all international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective but small agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees, which conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place all trade functions and more than 2,500 additional employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's economic leadership among world leaders, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports. Most witnesses at the recent congressional hearings expressed concerns about this change.
<p>
The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation<i>31</i> to establish a U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, along with the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. The insulation of trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the Administration.
<p>
<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to the new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had failed to correct a number of organizational problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer  --  without substantial reorganization  --  of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<p>
<br>
<b>Bureau of Export Administration</b><br>
The seven-year-old Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) administers export controls and coordinates the 17-nation Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The BXA's primary mission, therefore, is to safeguard the national interest by monitoring the export of potentially dangerous "dual-use" technologies.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department. Controlling the export of militarily useful commodities is a national security matter. If such technologies proliferate, the burden falls on the military to solve the problem. The Department of Defense deserves to be involved directly in the export licensing process because it is in the best position to judge the military utility of particular technologies. Putting the responsibility for export controls in the hands of the USTR or the Treasury Department implies that export controls should be treated as a trade issue, not a national security issue. It would be appropriate, however, for controversial licensing decisions to be appealed to the presidential level.
<p>
A special interagency report issued by the DOC with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State drew attention to the duplication of export control programs by the BXA. The four-agency report concluded:  "Consolidating these functions under the appropriate official will provide not only the proper oversight but also a more efficient and effective approach for tracking referred applications and examining export trends."<i>32</i>
<p>
The bill introduced by Senator Abraham transfers BXA functions to the Defense Department, but the version introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Chrysler transfers export licensing to the State Department.<i>33</i> The legislation introduced by Representative Mica transfers all export licensing functions to the proposed new Cabinet department for trade.<i>34</i> Both the Chrysler and Mica proposals would introduce greater uncertainty for key U.S. export industries such as aircraft, chemicals, and computer technology. Transferring all BXA responsibilities to the Defense Department would correct the problem of administrative conflicts between agencies, but exporters will object that dual-use technology sales will still be made by other countries. New procedures for review of the Defense Department's licensing decisions at the presidential level are needed to address this concern. The USTR, as the President's trade envoy, would be able to address these problems in trade policy and work to stop foreign export sales of dual-use technology.<i>35</i>
<p>
<b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><br>
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created by executive order in 1971 to help promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to show these businesses how to secure government contracts. The MBDA also provides funds for numerous Minority Business Development Centers (MBDCs) and American Indian Development Centers (IBDCs). Congress appropriated nearly $45 million for this program in fiscal 1995.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should close down the Minority Business Development Agency.<i>36</i> Although hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the MBDA since 1971, it has never been authorized formally by Congress. The MBDA's stated objective is to show businesses how to get government contracts, which is hardly the best way to encourage minority business development. Its approach merely duplicates the efforts of the failed 8(a) loan program of the Small Business Administration. Numerous reports have criticized this kind of preference program lending, finding that many of the small businesses favored by these kinds of programs are never able to stand alone without government assistance.<i>37</i>
<p>
In recent years, Congress has altered the MBDA's mission toward what is best described as corporate welfare, subsidizing high-technology firms and university research projects. These questionable expenditures duplicate dozens of other wasteful federal programs and seem little more than an attempt to justify the existence of an agency whose only rationale is dispensing special-interest funds.
<p>
The most effective way for Congress to help small minority-owned businesses would be to repeal labor regulations that generally frustrate small start-up firms and to amend the tax code to encourage investment in new small enterprises. In addition, minority firms serving the public sector would be helped by repeal of such discriminatory laws as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965. These laws raise the costs of government construction and service contracts by requiring companies that bid for such contracts to file mountains of paperwork documenting that they pay their workers above-market wages. Larger firms, which tend not to be minority-owned, have the advantage in bidding on such contracts. Repealing these laws would create a level playing field, instantly making smaller firms more competitive.
<p>
<b>Travel and Tourism Administration</b><br>
Created in 1981, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) spends nearly $20 million per year supposedly to promote tourism and recreational activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material, and running regional marketing shows. The USTTA administers the Disaster Relief Financial Assistance Program, which supports tourism for states recently hit by natural disasters. A new program is "developing a regional and global understanding within Governments on the relation between tourism and the environment."<i>38</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should close down the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.<i>39</i> There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in an activity already well handled by a vast private travel and tourism industry. In 1992, over 45 million foreign travelers visited the United States. These tourists spent more than $55 billion in this country, including $17 billion in fares to U.S. air carriers. 
<p>
Private industry thus has a significant financial interest in promoting tourism and does not need taxpayers to pay its advertising costs. The agency often works with private-sector organizations, including the Travel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the "Discover America International Pow Wow" or the "Pow Wow Europe."  There is no justification for federal involvement in such commercial promotional activities, with taxpayer funds used to pay for normal business marketing costs. Tourist promotion should be organized by private-sector interests without taxpayer assistance. The federal government does not belong in the travel industry.
<p>
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</b><br>
The $2 billion-per-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed in 1970 to consolidate commercially oriented ocean resource activities housed in other government agencies. NOAA's non-weather-related programs include a broad range of unrelated activities, such as commercial fisheries management, endangered species protection, habitat management, and research projects.<i>40</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should (1) separate the National Weather Service from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishing it as an independent agency with its functions reduced to specialized data collection and emergency warning activities,<i>41</i> and (2) reduce by 50 percent all non-Weather Service NOAA funding over five years. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should be transferred to the current Department of Interior. Most functions of the National Ocean Service should be privatized, and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet should be closed down. To accomplish this, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Return the functions performed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to what are now the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Coast Guard.<i>42</i>
<p>
<li>Impose fees on commercial and recreational fishing interests for fishing in federal waters. These fees should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with managing federal fishing stocks.
<p>
<li>Privatize most National Ocean Service functions.
<p>
<li>Terminate the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet.<i>43</i>
<p>
</ul>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consumes nearly 60 percent of the budget of the Department of Commerce and about 37 percent of its staff. NOAA oversees three significant non-Weather Service agencies:  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet. Many functions of these programs can be moved to other agencies, terminated, privatized, or turned over to the states.
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency managing marine mammal and commercial fisheries resources in federal marine waters. Savings can be achieved by transferring NMFS fisheries and protected species management activities to the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. NMFS fisheries monitoring and enforcement activities can be transferred to the Coast Guard, which already has policing powers over federal waters. Specific fisheries management functions can be transferred to the regional councils in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf states. Federal funding should be ended for state fisheries grants, commercial fisheries promotion and development programs, and aquaculture research. The seafood inspection program could be transferred to the FDA inspection program.
<p>
Currently, unlike commercial interests that use public lands and extract minerals, the commercial and recreational fishing industries pay nothing for the right to fish in federal waters. Because these resources are considered free, and because the industry is overcapitalized as the result of government loan and fishing vessel construction programs, the federal fishing stock is rapidly becoming depleted. Indeed, the government has paid millions in income supplements to Northeast fisherman who have seen their profits fall due to depleted stocks. It also spends millions on fisheries recovery programs, stock surveys, and hatcheries. The industry that benefits from these programs contributes nothing to their cost.
<p>
Charging commercial and recreational fishing interests a fee or requiring them to pay a royalty to the federal government would place a premium on fishing in federal waters. Such a fee system would help defray the cost of resource management and a smaller fishing fleet would reduce the stress placed on federal fishing stocks that has forced a moratorium on fishing from many ports.
<p>
The National Ocean Service (NOS) engages in such diverse activities as mapping and charting, oil spill research, coastal monitoring, and marine sanctuary management. Savings can be achieved by privatizing the agency's navigational and aeronautical charting and mapping activities currently performed by its National Geodetic Survey office.<i>44</i> The Geodetic Survey has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to chart navigational routes. There already are private companies drafting and marketing aeronautical services. Those activities that cannot be privatized should be transferred to the Coast Guard.
<p>
In addition, all regional coastal management programs, such as the $45 million Coastal Zone Management grant program and the $1 million Charleston area management plan, should be terminated and continued by state authorities if they choose to do so. Marine sanctuary programs can be merged into the Department of Interior or transferred to state governments.
<p>
The NOAA Corps also has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Today the Corps operates a fleet of 18 research vessels, as well as ten fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters. All of these functions should be terminated. The NOAA Corps is outmoded, and its research fleet, reports the GAO, is "old and technologically obsolete."  NOAA is calling for a 15-year, $1.9 billion program to modernize and purchase 24 vessels but "has no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represents the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements."<i>45</i>  Many of the Corps' charting activities are duplicated by private companies or the Coast Guard and need not be continued; its ships should be given to universities and marine research centers, and its aircraft to the Air Force. Hurricane research now can be performed entirely through satellites.
<p>
<b>National Weather Service</b><br>
The primary function of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to issue warnings of severe weather and floods in order to minimize life and property loss. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service -- an NWS adjunct -- operates the satellites producing the data the NWS uses to conduct its forecasts. The combined budgets of these programs comprise over half of NOAA's nearly $2 billion annual budget.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should reduce funding for the National Weather Service by 50 percent over three years. The Weather Service should reduce its role by specializing in data collection and emergency warning efforts. NOAA's satellite program could be merged with the redundant Air Force weather satellite program. An assessment then should be made of the possibility of privatizing polar-orbiting satellites and information distribution functions.<i>46</i>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and bureaucratic inefficiencies, the reputation of the National Weather Service is under fire. For example, according to the General Accounting Office, its modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>47</i> The only way to salvage this program is to reduce it to its core functions and introduce a significant dose of competition and private-sector capital.
<p>
Many functions of the Weather Service should be contracted out to private firms or simply transferred to the private sector. There are now approximately 300 private companies in the U.S. preparing and disseminating weather forecasts to businesses and the public on a commercial basis. According to the Commercial Weather Services Association, "private meteorologists and for-profit companies provide the public upwards of 85 percent of its weather forecasts, through television weathercasts, in newspaper weather maps, and on radio."<i>48</i>
<p>
The Weather Service should turn over to private firms its specialized services, such as fruit frost and agricultural forecasting, aviation forecasting, and fire weather forecasting, and privatize or close the regional climate centers that compete directly with private firms.<i>49</i> In addition, the Service spends about $200 million per year in "fringe" weather operations -- such as Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts and Decadal to Centennial Change -- which have little scientific validity and no practical value. These should be terminated.
<p>
The Service's field structure should be consolidated. The NWS has five headquarters offices, six regional offices, four national centers, and 334 field offices. This field office structure was designed when technology did not allow instant communication. Little has been done to alter this outmoded structure. Reducing these offices to no more than 25 facilities would save millions each year.
<p>
The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes privatizing such specialized NWS services as aviation, marine, and agricultural forecasting. The Office of Management and Budget projects these measures will save $40 million over five years. These recommendations are a small but good beginning.
<p>
<b>Patent and Trademark Office</b><br>
The patent system was established by the first Congress "to promote the progress of the useful arts" under Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. The registration of trademarks was first authorized in 1870. About 110,000 patents and about 69,700 trademarks were registered for fiscal 1992 alone, and 5,700 trademark registrations were renewed. A substantial portion of the annual Patent Office budget is funded by fees and other payments for publication and services by the public.
<p>
<br>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
Section 205 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation places the Patent and Trademark Office under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Other alternatives also have been proposed. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA) has introduced legislation<i>50</i> to establish an independent government corporation, an idea favored by the American Bar Association's Section on Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law.<i>51</i> An independent corporation, as proposed by the ABA, is clearly superior because this function can be fully self-financing. Documenting the ownership of patent and trademark rights is an activity that provides specific economic value to private parties, who can enforce these rights in civil lawsuits.
<p>
<b>Technology Administration (Office of Technology Policy)</b><br>
The Technology Administration (TA) was created in 1988 as a successor to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. This program oversees the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which are intended to promote commercially useable technology through research grants and subsidies. The office of the Undersecretary for Technology is an example of administrative overhead that can be eliminated by dismantling the Department of Commerce. The Undersecretary for Technology exercises executive and policy direction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technological Information Service, which is one of the largest publishing firms in the United States. The principal functions of the office, however, are to send representatives to interdepartmental meetings throughout the federal government and to supervise public relations activities, such as the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should close down the Technology Administration. The National Technical Information Service should be closed or privatized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, in addition to the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships program,<i>52</i> also should be abolished. The technology programs represent most clearly the failed theories of government-industry "partnership," in which bureaucrats pick projects to subsidize and encourage private-sector interests to pursue government funding rather than to invest in entrepreneurial research. The House of Representatives has voted to discontinue funding for the Advanced Technology Program.<i>53</i>
<p>
<b>National Technical Information Service</b><br>
The National Technical Information Service is a publishing firm within the federal government which collects and disseminates scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by government and foreign sources. It provides databases and other computer services to private-sector and governmental clients and essentially covers its costs by setting prices for its publications and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should privatize the National Technical Information Service. The NTIS is required by law to pay its own costs and usually does so. This Commerce Department program is essentially a publishing business which already prices its products and services to those who benefit from them. Since it has proven itself able to operate in a businesslike way on its own, it should be privatized immediately.
<p>
<b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b><br>
Most of Commerce's recent growth in spending is due to increases in the budget for industrial policy funding of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Overall, outlays for NIST are scheduled under current law to skyrocket from $167 million in FY 1994 to $466 million in FY 1995 -- a 180 percent increase in one year. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes that outlays for NIST nearly double by FY 1997, to $1.02 billion.
<p>
NIST's primary role is to promote commercial research and development projects. It carries out this mission through research projects and grant programs such as the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships(MEPs).<i>54</i> In FY 1996, the Clinton Administration proposes a 622 percent increase in budget authority for ATP, when compared with 1993 levels. MEP budget authority will jump by 716 percent over the same period under the Administration proposal. NIST, once called the National Bureau of Standards, also sets industry standards for various technological goods and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br>
Congress should close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This means ending NIST's Advanced Technology Program and its Scientific and Technical Research and Services, in addition to halting construction of new NIST research facilities. Weights and measures and other standards can be supervised by the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
Although the Clinton Administration and many in Congress believe industrial policy initiatives like NIST are the key to America's competitive success, the exact opposite is true. Industrial policy programs rarely encourage the development of vibrant new industries, and when they do it is usually at very high cost. More important, NIST already shows signs of becoming one of the federal government's leading high-technology pork-barrel programs, replacing highway and other infrastructure programs. 
<p>
NIST should be abolished before any more harm is done to the economy and before any more taxpayer dollars are distributed wastefully to favored interest groups. Its research programs and facilities could be privatized very quickly. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, notes that such transformations have been proved successful even for organizations funded exclusively with federal money. White argues that privatization of federal R&D labs makes sense because, "With their new freedom to pursue research in whatever areas the market demands -- rather than just fulfilling government missions -- these laboratories might, if successful, spin-off companies and attract new businesses at a far greater rate than they do today. Research universities and private R&D companies with less governmental direction of their activities tend to contribute significantly to their region's economies."<i>55</i>
<p>
<b>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</b><br>
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) jointly manages the electromagnetic spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The NTIA also gives Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants to public television and radio organizations to help expand the audience for public programming. The newest NTIA promotional effort, the National Information Infrastructure (NII), hopes to channel funds into various "information highway" projects. Although an estimated $70 million - $100 million is to be spent on such projects in 1995, the Administration has set higher funding goals of $1 billion - $2 billion annually for future years.<i>56</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should cut by 75 percent the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and transfer the remaining functions (those concerning oversight of public bands of the radio spectrum) to the Federal Communications Commission.<i>57</i> These functions then would be phased out with the FCC as the entire spectrum is privatized.
<p>
Efforts like the Public Telecommunications Facilities and Information Infrastructure programs are little more than high-technology pork projects. But whether it is spectrum management or public programming promotional efforts, the NTIA has little reason to be independent from the FCC. Communications policy should be embodied in one agency to minimize duplication and cut costs. Hence, all current NTIA tasks, after funding has been reduced 75 percent, should be transferred to the FCC. In addition, Congress should not allow the FCC to use the transfer of authority as an excuse to increase its budget. This should encourage the FCC to reform and simplify federal spectrum management policies, which are inefficient and discourage the advance of telecommunications competition.<i>58</i> Congress's goal should be to place all spectrum into private hands as rapidly as possible, abolish the FCC, and transfer responsibility under international spectrum management treaties to the State Department.

<title>Commerce Department Funds Blatant Lobbying -- Heritage</title>

No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any...printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to favor or oppose...any legislation....</blockquote>
<center>											18 USC 1913</center>
<p>
Opponents of the effort to end 40 years of political corruption manifested in a system of taxpayer-subsidized lobbying often state that existing federal law already prohibits using grant funds for advocacy.  They cite the above section of the U.S. Code to defend this view.
<p>
	It appears, however, that the law is irrelevant.  In recent weeks, the Department of Commerce has provided $200,000 to HandsNet, Inc., a California group which operates an online computer service focused on lobbying and available on the Internet.  According to its own Internet-based documents, HandsNet links "5,000 public interest and human service organizations across the United States."  Among the services offered: "the latest Action Alerts."
<p>
	A description of the grant award1 prepared by the grant provider, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (part of the Commerce Department), specifically mentions that the grant will allow "National organizations [to] help local ones keep up to date by publicizing action alerts...."  A recent selection of alerts includes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>"Istook Amendment--Call Your Representatives 10/30/95"</b><br>
"Now is the time to turn up the heat.... So Call, E-Mail, or Fax Your Representative Today!"
<p>
<li><b>"Give President Clinton a Wake-Up Call"</b><br>
"If President Clinton signs immoral welfare and Medicaid 'reform' bills, the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for children will be destroyed."
<p>
<li><b>"Stop English-only Proposals in Congress 10/24/95"</b><br>
"Call and write to your Representative and Senator. Ask to meet with them directly."
<p>
<li><b>"Congress Yields To Traditional Values Coalition"</b><br>
"The hearing, dubbed 'Parental Involvement in Social Issues in Education'...is likely to become a tax-funded platform for gay bashing."
</ul><p>
Each of the alerts is supported by information to describe what action needs to be taken and what arguments can be used to lobby Congress most effectively.

<p>

<b>About the Grant to HandsNet</b>
<p>
	The $200,000 awarded to HandsNet, Inc., of California was to be used for the nationwide training of public interest organizations on how to use the Internet more effectively. The NTIA award summary states that HandsNet "will train 250 organizations in Internet skills, so that they can publish information on the new system."	In addition, HandsNet will "conduct a national outreach campaign" to introduce human services groups to the Internet.
<p>
	The major component of the grant appears to be a new training center in Washington, D.C. The center will be fully functional around January 1, 1996, according to HandsNet documents, but is housed temporarily at the headquarters of Families USA (funder of the 1994 Clinton health care bus caravans).  The national center will be operated in conjunction with the Institute for Global Communications, also of California.
<p>
<b>About HandsNet</b>
<p>
	In reviewing the HandsNet site on the Internet, it appears that its principal purpose is explicit political advocacy.  The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, among many other issues.  The three key information components provided are Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest (a summary of the alerts), and daily updates on key issues.  According to its Internet site, HandsNet is affiliated with the Institute for Global Communications, an arm of the Tides Foundation.  Members of HandsNet include the major opponents of the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort, including OMB Watch and the Alliance for Justice.
<p>
<b>About the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure 
Assistance Program (TIIAP)</b>
<p>
	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program is operated by NTIA in the Commerce Department.  Under the Clinton Administration, this program has mushroomed in cost, from $10 million in FY 1994 to $25 million in FY 1995.  In 1994 there were 92 grants; in the most recent round (to be announced in mid-November, but already awarded), there are 120.  There also are indications that the TIIAP may subsidize other lobbying activities, in addition to those of HandsNet, Inc.
<p>
	According to NTIA documents, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America received $300,000 in 1994 to set up a "nationwide on-line information system" for itself and all 164 affiliates.  Also in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet received funding to "establish a network of regional field representatives" and "demonstrate a model for building a national grassroots information system," among other things.
<p>
	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, ACORN (which led noisy demonstrations in Congress earlier this year), the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Citizens Fund (an affiliate of Citizen Action, an active grassroots lobbying organization).  It is unclear which, if any, will receive funding.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Commerce Department, through NTIA, has awarded a grant to an online lobbying organization for the specific purpose of engaging more groups in its Internet advocacy efforts.  The $200,000 gift to HandsNet, Inc., to train people in the publishing of action alerts and other lobbying materials represents a blatant misuse of taxpayer funds.
<P>
	Supporters of taxpayer-funded political patronage argue that the current system is designed to prevent abuses.  The case of the Commerce Department and HandsNet, Inc., provides a serious test of this claim. The fact that such a significant grant could be made with no effort to hide the fact that it directly funds lobbying activities clearly demonstrates the need for Congress to reform this costly and irresponsible form of political corruption.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Energy -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1061<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> was created as a Cabinet-level department in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter as part of the federal effort to address the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Fearing that international energy shortages were the wave of the future, the President felt a highly visible national agency was necessary to promote energy conservation, control federal supplies of power, and develop alternative sources of energy. However, the OPEC oil embargo then collapsed -- without any assistance from the DOE -- and international oil supplies stabilized. 
<p>
And yet, the department remains. In fact, DOE has grown in tax dollars spent and functions performed -- the result of 15 years of searching for something to do. As Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office has testified, "DOE's mission and priorities have changed dramatically over time so that the Department is now very different from what it was in 1977. While energy research, conservation and policy-making dominated early DOE priorities, weapons production and now environmental cleanup overshadow its budget."<sup>1</sup>  Thanks to this continual empire-building, the department's budget has increased by 235 percent, and 85 percent today is spent on activities other than energy resources. For instance, nearly $12 billion is budgeted annually for environmental quality and nuclear waste disposal, with close to another $3 billion earmarked for fundamental science research.
<p>
The Department of Energy not only has strayed from its original mission of energy oversight, but also has failed to conduct efficiently the services it now provides. Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review reported that due to inefficiencies as high as 40 percent within DOE's Environmental Management program, more than $70 billion could be lost over the next 30 years.<sup>2</sup>  Victor Rezendes testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management... to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight.... "<sup>3</sup>. These management problems and the inefficiencies that flow from them have been caused largely by DOE's continual efforts to re-align itself and justify its existence.<p>It is time to close the Department of Energy. Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) have developed legislation that would dismantle the department.<sup>4</sup>  Title I of both bills redesignates the Department of Energy as the "Energy Programs Resolution Agency," modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. Both bills would establish a three-year limit for closing DOE, privatize Energy's valuable oil reserves and other assets, establish a commission to recommend DOE laboratory privatizations, set new guidelines for toxic waste disposal, and transfer control over the nuclear weapons stockpile to the Department of Defense.
<p>
Under a plan developed by analysts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, DOE's defense-related programs would be transferred to an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and its primary research functions would be transferred to universities or the National Science Foundation.<sup>5</sup>  Federal funding for commercially oriented energy supply, research, and development projects would be terminated, and the research responsibility would be transferred to the private sector. All commercial energy functions, including the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), Petroleum Reserves, and Uranium Enrichment activities, would be denationalized and sold to the private sector.
<p>
Specifically, under the Heritage Plan, Congress would:
<p><ul>
<li> Transfer all defense-related nuclear weapons functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. This new agency would have primary management and oversight responsibility for environmental cleanup activities.
<p>
<li> Decrease the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.em.doe.gov">environmental management</a> budget by 30 percent and adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
<p>
<li> Establish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as a federal corporation with the ultimate goal of full privatization.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Supply Research and Development programs and privatize the government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Conservation funding, including state grants and research programs.
<p>
<li> Phase out federal funding for General Science and Basic Research and transfer the laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them.
<p>
<li> Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the five Power Marketing Administrations to the private sector, using a variety of stock sale approaches.
<p>
<li> Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency.
<p>
<li> Close down or privatize the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a>.
</ul><p>
Closing the department and making the related reforms would save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five years, including $16 billion in asset sales. By contrast, Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "re-invention" plan would save only $14.1 billion over five years, including $5.7 billion in asset sales. The proposals to close the department developed by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would save more than $17 billion over five years.
<p>
There are two ways to close down a federal department. The first is simply to shift the department's responsibilities to other agencies and throw the old letterhead into the trash. The alternative is to eliminate, devolve, or privatize responsibilities whenever possible, and transfer only essential responsibilities to other departments. This latter approach is the one that should be used with the Department of Energy. DOE's history of failure and ineffectiveness demands nothing less.

<p>
<b>CHANGING MISSIONS AND BUREAUCRATIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
Created in 1977, the Department of Energy has changed missions numerous times over its almost two decades. Its original mission -- administering the complex set of regulations, price controls, and allocation laws established in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 -- was a dismal failure that actually resulted in higher energy costs and increased dependence on foreign oil.<sup>6</sup><p>Ronald Reagan promised during his 1980 campaign to eliminate the Department of Energy. Instead, he changed its mission from energy conservation, imposed through a centralized structure of regulations, to energy promotion by means of market mechanisms. The department also gained responsibility for the production of nuclear weapons during the 1980s because of a belief that production and stockpile management should be controlled by a civilian agency.
<p>
DOE's central mission changed once again with the end of the Cold War. The high level of weapons production was no longer necessary, and world energy supplies remained constant. Ever vigilant about finding a purpose, DOE began to concentrate on environmental remediation of past actions, including cleaning up its own contaminated weapons facilities. DOE's fiscal 1996 budget request makes this change in mission clear. Thirty-nine percent of the $17.8 billion budget request is earmarked for "Environmental Quality," while only 15 percent is for "Energy Resources."<sup>7</sup>  Another large portion of Energy's budget is dedicated to research and development of alternative-source energy supply, including solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power generation (see <a href="bg1061c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Despite this massive effort, petroleum and coal remain the dominant sources of power in America.
<p>
DOE's newest initiative, the fourth change in mission, is the creation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). These "agreements" are contracts whereby the Department of Energy allows individual companies to use federal laboratories, and even conducts research and development, all at taxpayer expense. CRADAs are meant to increase the competitiveness of American companies and support quality jobs at a time when much of the defense-related work completed at DOE's laboratories in the past is no longer seen as necessary. CRADAs thus offer the dual advantage of providing private companies with free research while preventing the closing of federal facilities -- or so proponents argue.
<p>
The Department of Energy's CRADA initiatives are among the most egregious examples of corporate welfare that benefits individual companies at tremendous expense to American taxpayers. According to a recent series on "High-Tech Handouts" in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, researchers who once worked for a private company are now employed by DOE but continue to do the same work. The only thing that has changed is that taxpayers are picking up the tab.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, when this research is successful, individual companies can earn protected trade secrets or patents that often are not available even to the federal government. Millions of American taxpayers thus may be underwriting a single company's market position. <p> The results of most efforts are both disappointing and expensive. For example, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> notes that DOE has spent some $792 million on CRADAs between 1992 and 1995. The result has been 46 new companies at a cost of $17 million per company.<sup>9</sup>  Even more disappointing, many recipients of DOE assistance are reducing their research and development budgets and trimming their workforces. General Electric, which earned $4.7 billion in profits in 1994, received $25.4 million in federal assistance between 1990 and 1994. Over the same period, GE cut 80,000 positions from its payroll. Clearly, DOE's CRADA program is not meeting its stated goal of job creation.
<p>

<b>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<p>
There is no legitimate rationale for a Department of Energy. Centralized planning of energy production and distribution, including operation of the Power Marketing Administrations, has proven ineffective and expensive. Mass-scale nuclear weapons production is no longer needed with the end of the Cold War. Environmental remediation efforts have been inefficient and often impractical. And efforts to bolster private industry through CRADAs are expensive, ineffective, and fast becoming a primary source of congressional earmarking and corporate welfare. All defense-related functions now being administered by DOE, including environmental remediation, should be transferred to the Department of Defense. All assets that are commercially viable should be privatized. Whatever remains should be terminated (see Table 1).
<p>
<b>Environmental Cleanup</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy was responsible for the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and the pressure of competing with the Soviet Union prevented environmental protection from being a top priority at weapons production facilities. Today, although production has ceased, the environmental remediation of DOE's facilities remains. The vast majority of contamination problems at the department's nuclear weapons plants involve some level of radioactivity. Since 1989, the department has managed, stored, and cleaned up hazardous wastes produced at the plants under the Environmental Management (EM) program, which has three basic components:  Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, and Facility Transition and Management (created in 1992).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Move the Department of Energy's environmental management responsibilities to a new independent agency within the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li>Adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Since its inception in 1989, DOE's Environmental Management program has almost quadrupled its budget to a fiscal 1996 request of $6.6 billion. The General Accounting Office estimates that the total cost of remediation at federal nuclear waste disposal sites will run as high as $200 billion.<sup>10</sup>  However, given DOE's poor performance in the past, this could be only a fraction of the eventual total. DOE also should re-evaluate its original goals and strategies for dealing with this problem. This is not to imply that contamination of these sites is insignificant. To the contrary, the amount of radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex is so great that more effective action is absolutely essential.
<p>
The Environmental Management program was supposed to clean up all sites within 30 years. Agreements signed by DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulatory agencies specify requirements and set milestones for achieving those requirements. Unfortunately, however, the costs of cleanup have escalated rapidly, breakthroughs in technology have not occurred at the pace originally estimated, and the nature and scope of the contamination problem simply are not known. "As a result," notes the General Accounting Office, these cleanup "agreements taken together do not reflect a national strategy of targeting resources based on the highest risks to human health and the environment."<sup>11</sup>  It is now clear that DOE will not be able to clean up the sites either within the 30-year time frame or any time soon thereafter.<p>Much of the problem lies with the assumptions that were made in setting these goals. The focus has been on timelines for reducing contamination rather than on the more sensible goal of reducing risk to human health and safety to the maximum extent possible for any given level of funding. This "biggest bang for the buck" approach would save far more lives at far less cost. For instance, if a site poses little threat to the local population, it may be better to delay cleanup until it becomes a higher priority. This would allow funds to be spent on sites that pose a more likely threat. Additionally, since the value of money is a function of time (how far in the future it is spent), cleanups would cost relatively less in the future -- especially if new technologies are invented. Alternative strategies such as land use controls also might encourage more effective cleanup decisions.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills contain solid provisions for prioritizing remediation actions at the various contamination sites. First they would transfer cleanup responsibilities to a civilian office within the Department of Defense. Then clear goals for reducing overall risks to public health would be adopted to ensure that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first. These sensible reorganization and prioritization plans would ensure an efficient yet effective process of remediation.
<p>
<b>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</b>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is charged with constructing a permanent repository for the nuclear waste generated at civilian nuclear power plants. In the past, this material has been stored "on-site."  Realizing the danger to residents of surrounding areas, Congress in 1982 passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which mandated the construction of a single storage site that could hold all of the nation's nuclear waste beginning in 1998.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Reconstitute OCRWM as a mixed government-private corporation as a first step toward full privatization.<sup>12</sup><p><li>Redefine the new corporation's mission to concentrate on interim rather than permanent storage.<p><li>Establish concrete goals leading to the commencement of storage in 1998.<p></ul>Rationale:  The Department of Energy's efforts to create a safe and permanent repository have been dismal from the start. DOE has spent more than $4 billion just to study the viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada and estimates that another $2.3 billion will be necessary over the next 15 years. The construction, maintenance, and operation of the future repository will cost an estimated $30 billion. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office now estimates that storage cannot begin until 2023.<sup>13</sup>  In other words, for every year OCRWM has been in existence, it has fallen a year behind schedule.
<p>
These inefficiencies are attributable primarily to two factors. First, the National Waste Policy Act specifically requires the permanent, rather than temporary, storage of nuclear wastes. This has added great costs to the investigation process and will add even more to the future cost of storage and maintenance. Several proposals over the years, including Senator Grams's legislation and this year's House-passed appropriations bill, require the federal government to consider interim storage.<sup>14</sup>  This would allow storage and waste consolidation to begin in the near future. It also would allow for more detailed research and development into viable options for permanent storage.<p>Second, the program's organizational structure reflects many of the inefficiencies that haunt the Department of Energy in general:  excessively high expenses, scheduling lapses, poor contractor management, and a politically charged environment. Numerous studies over the past decade have commented on these problems and suggested that their cause is OCRWM's position within the Department of Energy. As early as 1984, only two years after the office was created, a report to the Secretary of Energy found that "Location of OCRWM within the Department of Energy makes it vulnerable to changes of policy and senior management as Administrations come and go."<sup>15</sup>  Studies generally have suggested that OCRWM be moved out of the Department of Energy and given the freedom to operate without political constraints.<sup>16 </sup><p>It is widely felt that the dangers presented by the transportation and storage of nuclear waste justify both stringent federal oversight of OCRWM and the timely and cost-effective construction of a nuclear waste repository. In the short term, both goals can be accomplished by creating a mixed government-private corporation. Such an organization would retain government oversight to ensure safety while allowing for efficiencies associated with private-sector incentives. In the long run, full privatization w
ill encourage the most efficient waste disposal by eliminating government interference in day-to-day operations. Safety standards could still be enforced through stringent congressional oversight.
<p>
Neither congressional proposal addresses the future of OCRWM privatization. Instead, control over civilian nuclear waste disposal is given to the Army Corps of Engineers. Given the long history of failure within the Army Corps,<sup>17</sup> it is disturbing that both Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would give it such a sensitive responsibility. It also does not seem likely that simply transferring its responsibilities to another government organization will solve the office's structural deficiencies.
<p>
High-Energy Science Research<sup>18</sup><br>The Department of Energy spends over $1.1 billion per year on basic research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and other general science programs. Many of these projects, such as the recently terminated <a href="http://www.ssc.gov">Superconducting Super Collider</a>, are considered "big science" because they require large and expensive facilities and teams of researchers.
<p>
The department owns nearly 30 research facilities around the country, nearly all of them managed and operated under contract by universities and private organizations. Of these facilities, 17 direct most of their programming to basic science and technology, high-energy physics, or nuclear physics research. Five are multi-program laboratories like <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne</a> near Chicago; <a href="http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/bnl.html">Brookhaven</a> in Upton, New York; and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore</a> in Berkeley, California. Another 12 are specialized, or "program-dedicated."  These include Fermilab near Chicago; the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> near Stanford, California; and the Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (formerly known as the Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences) at the University of California at Los Angeles.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Phase out over three years all federal funding for general science and basic research.
<p>
<li>Transfer the federal laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them or sell them to private-sector operators. 
<p>
<li>Shift any remaining funding for basic research to the National Science Foundation. 
<p>
<li>Award all funds based on competitive bids.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Many of the laboratories now owned by the Department of Energy were established during World War II in conjunction with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the world's first atomic bomb. Since then, they have "expanded their missions to encompass civilian research and development in many disciplines -- from high-energy physics to advanced computing," reports the GAO; but because of DOE mismanagement, "the multi-program laboratories -- both individually and as a group -- do not have either clearly defined missions or specific implementation strategies that bring together laboratory resources to focus on accomplishing departmental objectives or national goals."<sup>19</sup>  With no defined mission, other analysts report, these laboratories often compete directly with the private sector.<p>More surprising is the amount of money DOE has spent subsidizing private companies. For instance, the department has spent more than $5.2 billion on "technology transfer" programs. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary defends this by stating, "It's about jobs; it's about creating jobs. If we don't create jobs, then it's a failure."  As two <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reporters note, "By O'Leary's own measure then, it's a flop."<sup>20</sup>  Between 1990 and 1994, for example, the federal government, largely through the DOE laboratories, transferred $293.1 million to eight large companies with annual revenues of $700 billion. Yet, over the same four-year period, these eight firms reduced their U.S. payrolls by 329,438 positions and their research and development budgets by $516 million (two dollars for every dollar of government subsidy).<sup>21</sup><p>Numerous studies, including the recent Galvin Commission report, have made recommendations to DOE on how to focus the work of these laboratories, but the department has failed to do so. Indeed, many laboratory managers report that the Energy bureaucracy often stands in the way of scientific progress. These managers "view DOE's day-to-day management as costly a
nd unproductive in meeting the laboratories' missions."<sup>22</sup> <p>The only way to free these laboratories from DOE's bureaucratic micromanagement is to sell them to private research firms or transfer them at nominal charge to the universities currently operating them. This would allow these facilities to forge partnerships with other private technology interests or to pursue basic research independent of the political or budgetary process. 
<p>
Federal funding should be phased out over a three-year period to give these facilities time to find other sources of funding. One option would be to use the $1.6 billion realized from selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve to establish an endowment for university basic research facilities, freeing them permanently from the uncertainties of the budget process.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals would establish a laboratory closure commission, similar to the present military base closure commission, to study the problem and recommend which DOE laboratories (except for those engaged in defense-related activities) should be closed, privatized, or downsized. It is important that Congress establish strict guidelines for the commission so that facilities which remain within the structure of the federal government engage solely in research directly applicable to federal functions. Such guidelines would mandate that all laboratories, regardless of stated mission, are investigated for inefficiencies and wasteful programs.
<p>
<b>Power Marketing Administrations</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) which sell wholesale electricity generated by 131 dams built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These PMAs (Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area) sold nearly $3 billion worth of electric power in 1994 -- just under 8 percent of all power generated in the United States.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>End all federal assistance to the PMAs, including direct appropriations and the authority to borrow from the Treasury.
<p>
<li>Sell the Power Marketing Administrations to private investors through a variety of privatization schemes by the end of 1998. 
<p>
<li>Sell the hydroelectric power plants by the turn of the century.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  After nearly 50 years of taxpayer subsidies, it is time for the five Power Marketing Administrations to become fully private enterprises. Customers have enjoyed hidden subsidies for years because these government-owned utilities have been able to borrow from the Treasury at below-market interest rates and take as long as 50 years to pay back the loans. Of the more than $16 billion lent to the PMAs by the Treasury, only about 25 percent has been repaid.<sup>23</sup><p>PMA electricity is not sold to the highest bidder. Instead, it is sold at varying rates to municipal utilities, cooperatives, industrial users, other government facilities, and investor-owned utilities. Municipal utilities and rural cooperatives are "preference customers," which means they pay for electricity at cost -- often as little as half the rates paid by customers in other parts of the country. Industrial users have a different rate schedule. Aluminum companies, for example, consume as much as one-third of Bonneville's power, and "the rate they pay is, by contract, tied to aluminum prices."  Thus, when aluminum prices fell over the past five years, Bonneville was buying power "for as much as 3.5 cents a kilowatt hour, [but] it had to sell it to those utilities for 1.8."<sup>24</sup> <p>Selling the PMAs is the only way to bring sound business practices to these government-owned utilities. Congress should follow the example of countries around the world that are moving to privatize their state-owned utilities. In 1993, for instance, Argentina, Germany, and the United Kingdom raised a total of $4.4 billion by selling state-owned electric utilities to private investors -- including U.S. investors. 
<p>
The British experience is particularly relevant to the United States. In 1991, the British government restructured its government-owned electricity-generating facilities into four regional corporations and sold them to the public in a stock offering. These companies compete to offer electricity through a national grid system. They also compete with various small producers. The stock offering included preferential pricing for employees as well as discounts and incentives for electricity customers and small investors. Stock also was offered for purchase on foreign exchanges. This strategy of building support for the sale among employees, customers, and small investors made the sale very popular. The stock offering was heavily oversubscribed and yielded over $6 billion for taxpayers.
<p>
When the Reagan Administration failed to get Congress to act on its 1987 proposal to sell the Alaska and Southeastern PMAs, it tried unsuccessfully to reform the PMAs' debt repayment schedules. This effort has continued under the Bush and Clinton Administrations. This year, the Clinton Administration also is renewing the effort to sell four of the PMAs (excluding Bonneville) for a total of about $3.7 billion. The White House says it will work with Congress to develop specific proposals to privatize these assets. President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget projects that the Alaska sale could generate $83 million. This sale has been in negotiation for more than six years and could be completed quickly if Congress acts to authorize it.
<p>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that the relatively small Southeastern and Southwestern PMAs could be sold for $500 million each.<sup>25</sup>  The Southeastern PMA, which sells less than 2 percent of the power in its region, could be sold swiftly to regional utilities because it does not own or operate any transmission facilities. It simply pays a fee to various utilities to market power through their transmission lines. The Southwestern PMA, which accounts for 4 percent of the energy sold in its region, also could be sold to regional investor-owned utilities.
<p>
OMB estimates that selling the much larger Western Area PMA (WAPA) headquartered in Golden, Colorado, could generate some $2.6 billion. According to the Department of Energy, while WAPA markets about 9 percent of the power in its region, its service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its wholesale customers provide power to 16 million consumers in 15 central and western states. Because of its large distribution area, WAPA should be broken up and sold in manageable pieces to investors.
<p>
Selling Bonneville (BPA) would be more complicated because of its size and the fact that it provides about 65 percent of the electric power in the Northwest. One method, used successfully by such countries as Britain, would be to sell through a broad-based stock option plan in order to neutralize opposition from the interests served by Bonneville and win popular support from public investors. Stock could be sold at favorable prices to employees, residential customers, environmentalists, fishing and agricultural interests, or others who may feel they stand to lose from privatization. Such a move also might bring support from the many investor-owned and public utilities in the region which reportedly have threatened to build their own power generators to free themselves from BPA's near-monopoly status.<sup>26</sup><p>Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals call for immediate sale of the Alaskan, Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations. This would result in savings of roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In addition, both plans transfer control of the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration to the Department of the Interior and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study outlining future courses for Bonneville.
<p>
<b>Energy Supply Research and Development</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $3.7 billion per year on research designed to develop or improve sources of energy. Initiated in response to the OPEC oil embargo to free U.S. consumers from dependence on foreign oil, these projects involve research on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear power, and such non-renewable sources as fossil fuels. Appropriations approved by Congress for fiscal 1995 include, among others, $442 million for fossil energy R&D, $288 million for solar energy research, $37 million for geothermal research, $293 million for nuclear energy research, and $49 million for wind energy systems.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all federal funding for energy supply research and development, including fossil fuel R&D.
<p>
<li>Privatize all government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In today's dollars, the federal government has spent over $70 billion on energy research programs since the Department of Energy was created in 1977 and has little or nothing to show for it. The United States imports 30 percent more petroleum now than before the oil shock of 1973, and alternative energy supply methods account for only one percent of all energy produced in this country.<sup>27</sup><p>Much of this DOE-funded research is already conducted by private firms or simply irrelevant to market needs. Electric utilities, for instance, voluntarily fund the $240 million-per-year Electric Power Research Institute at no government expense. Moreover, "the major new technologies for enhanced oil recovery... have come from private industry, not DOE," according to the Congressional Budget Office, and DOE's $9 billion investment in nuclear fission research has gone to waste because the private sector has no interest in building new nuclear power plants. Thus, Energy "has little in the way of commercial applications to show for its investment."<sup>28</sup>  All the federal government's attempts to outguess the energy market have produced are such expensive failures as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.<sup>29</sup>  Federal funding for renewable and non-renewable energy research and development should be halted immediately.<p>There are seven federal laboratories engaged in Energy Supply R&D research:  one multi-program laboratory (the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) and six program-dedicated laboratories like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. These facilities consume over $1 billion of total Energy Supply R&D funds. Congress should move to sell all seven to the private firms which currently operate them or transfer them to the universities with which they are affiliated. Private firms then can choose to continue funding for any research they decide is commercially relevant.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills include a review of these research and development activities by a laboratory closure commission. The Tiahrt plan is bolder because it establishes specific spending reductions for each of the next five fiscal years (a 25 percent reduction in fiscal 1997 and 50 percent reductions in each following year); Senator Grams proposes to leave any reductions to the discretion of the commission. The problem with allowing a commission to review DOE's research activities is that, while it helps remove political pressures from the process, it also fails to take into account the dismal record of these activities. DOE's energy supply research and development should be terminated, immediately and completely.
<p>
<b>Naval Petroleum Reserves</b>
<p>
Established in 1912, the federally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) is comprised of two commercial oil fields at Elk Hills (near Bakersfield, California) and Teapot Dome (near Casper, Wyoming) and oil-shale reserves (near Rifle, Colorado).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the highest bidder.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no longer any compelling national, strategic, or commercial reason for the federal government to own the Naval Petroleum Reserve. These oil fields were set aside by Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson to assure fuel for the Navy as it converted from coal to oil. By and large, they sat idle until the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974, when Congress decided that NPR oil should be pumped and sold and the proceeds used to ready the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Department of Energy owns 78 percent of the Elk Hills facility, and a private oil company (Chevron) owns the remaining 22 percent. Overall, the NPR is the equivalent of less than one percent of total U.S. domestic output -- hardly enough to be vital to national security interests.
<p>
Although the NPR generates more than $400 million per year in revenue to the government, studies have found that these fields are operated far less efficiently than comparable privately owned oil fields. The NPR was targeted for privatization by the Reagan Administration in a proposal endorsed by the President's Commission on Privatization in 1988. The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 budget also proposes selling the NPR, but Congress so far has failed to act. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the government's interest could be sold for some $1.5 billion, netting roughly $321 million after deducting the more than $400 million in revenues the NPR produces each year.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should embrace this effort and remove any legislative obstacles to selling these assets as quickly as possible.<p>The Tiahrt bill would transfer responsibility for the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the Department of the Interior and mandate the sale of a significant portion of the reserves to the private sector. The Secretary of Interior would then conduct a study to determine the best course of action concerning the remaining reserves. The Grams proposal, on the other hand, calls for sale of the entire reserve. This approach is preferable because it would result in much larger savings and serve taxpayers better.
<p>
<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b>
<p>
Created by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the nearly 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stockpile of crude oil available for release in the event of market disruptions such as the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The Department of Energy operates six underground salt dome storage sites on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserve immediately.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has become an expensive and obsolete vestige of the regulated oil markets that existed before the Reagan Administration deregulated them in 1981. Over the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States has spent about $4 billion constructing the SPR storage facilities and another $17 billion to fill the reserves. Although Congress has not approved funds to expand the reserve beyond its current level of 592 million barrels, the annual cost of operating these facilities is some $200 million. 
<p>
Since deregulation, the oil market has become increasingly diversified and the futures market, which hedges against price fluctuations, has become highly sophisticated. As a result, interruptions in the world oil supply of the sort that occurred during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991 do not have the same impact on the economy they once did. Moreover, the CBO notes, while the market responded efficiently to the Gulf War interruption, "both the process of deciding to use the SPR and the mechanism for selling the oil may have actually contributed to market uncertainty at the time."<sup>31</sup>. <p>The CBO estimates the SPR's current market value at $10 billion, or about $17 per barrel. However, the sales value may be less because the SPR is suffering water leakage as well as heat and gas buildups, which may present difficulties in extracting the oil. But even a more reasonable purchase price of $7 to $10 per barrel would generate revenues of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
<p>
Both congressional plans to terminate DOE call for partial sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, principally those held at Weeks Island, Louisiana. Representative Tiahrt proposes to transfer control over the other portions to the Interior Department, with the Secretary of Interior responsible for determining whether there is justification for selling further reserves. Senator Grams proposes to transfer responsibility for the SPR to the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense then would be responsible for determining what portion of the reserves should be maintained and what portion sold. Whoever is responsible, the goal should be to privatize the maximum amount of SPR possible. The final bill should set strict guidelines to ensure this.
<p>
<b>Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b>
<p>
For some 40 years, the U.S. government ran two uranium enrichment facilities, one at Portsmouth, Ohio, and the other at Paducah, Kentucky. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act transformed this federal program into a wholly owned government corporation (similar to Amtrak) called the United States Enrichment Corporation. The USEC currently produces and markets uranium enrichment services to more than 60 private utilities that own and operate commercial nuclear power plants in this country and abroad. The corporation generates revenues of approximately $1.5 billion annually and, after expenses, returns a "dividend" of roughly $30 million to the Treasury.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<ul><p>
<li>Sell the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to the private sector in FY 1996.
</ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no reason for the U.S. government to operate a commercial business, especially one that returns only a small profit to the Treasury while maintaining effective market control over the industry. According to its own promotional material, the USEC serves "approximately 90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the world market."<sup>32</sup>  Its annual revenues of $1.5 billion would rank it 286th on the <i>Fortune</i> 500 list of industrial firms. <p>Congress should remove the many needless obstacles and impediments placed on the corporation by the 1992 Act so that it can be made more attractive to private buyers and investors and sold in FY 1996 for top dollar. A businesslike enrichment corporation could bring bids of at least $1 billion if freed from oppressive congressional restrictions. Ideally, the two facilities should be sold to different buyers to avoid creating a private monopoly.
<p>
The House already has passed legislation to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
<p>
<b>Energy Conservation Research and Grant Programs</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $800 million per year for energy conservation and research. This research is targeted toward improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, industry, private and public buildings, and utilities.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all DOE conservation research and grant programs.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  This program funds research and grants that should be financed by the private sector and state or local governments. For FY 1995, for example, Congress approved over $430 million for research targeted toward private industry. This funding includes some $20 million for building systems, $2 million for heating and cooling technology, over $25 million for industrial co-generation, $22 million for materials and metals processing, over $50 million for alternative fuels utilization, $1.2 million for "engine optimization in alternative fuels utilization," $1 million for vehicle systems materials, $1.5 million for light duty engine development, and some $3 million for international market development.
<p>
Congress also earmarked $226 million for state-based weatherization programs, $22 million for state conservation programs, and an additional $29 million for the "institutional conservation program."33  However important these conservation measures may be, they are not properly a function of the federal government. Congress should get out of the business of funding and micromanaging purely private research and purely local responsibilities. <p>Energy Information, Policy, Regulation, and Departmental Administration<br>Some $400 million of the Department of Energy's $18 billion-per-year budget is dedicated to departmental administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Energy Information Administration, and the Office of Economic Regulation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
<li>Close down or privatize the Energy Information Administration.
<p>
<li>Eliminate all funding for non-defense departmental administration while closing down the Department of Energy. 
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In testimony before a congressional subcommittee earlier this year, the General Accounting Office warned that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management of the nuclear weapons complex to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight of contractors, inadequate information systems, and work force weaknesses."<sup>34</sup>  Although the department has reorganized many times over the years to correct these deficiencies, those efforts have failed. The only recourse for Congress is to close the agency.
<p>
To dismantle the Department of Energy, Congress will have to complete various housekeeping duties such as eliminating over $400 million per year in departmental overhead funding and spinning off entities which can stand alone. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is charged with regulating certain interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydropower, and electric industries, easily could be made an independent agency like the Federal Communications Commission. FERC is basically self-financed by the fees paid by regulated industries. Congress should begin a serious debate, however, over the extent to which the federal government should continue to regulate the private energy sector.
<p>
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is a quasi-independent agency within the Department of Energy intended to collect and disseminate data on petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, electricity, alternate fuel sources, and energy consumption. All of the activities and functions performed by the EIA are carried out by private firms, newsletters, trade magazines, and industry associations. The EIA should be privatized and all federal funding eliminated.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The proposals by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would close down DOE, not just re-invent or re-organize it. This is important because it would prevent future Congresses from simply re-inflating the department's funding. In contrast, Secretary O'Leary's re-invention plan maintains DOE's inefficient bureaucracy and perpetuates some of the department's most unnecessary functions. And, although O'Leary's plan would "save" a reported $14.1 billion over five years, a significant portion of these savings are from asset sales. Once these sales are complete, the Department of Energy -- re-invented or not -- will continue to exist at little or no savings to taxpayers. The two congressional termination plans, on the other hand, ensure large savings well beyond the next five years.
<p>
Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Energy does not fit this description. There is no role for DOE in energy supply or regulation with the fall of OPEC and a stable international flow of oil. There is no need for massive nuclear weapons production with the end of the Cold War. All that remains of the Department of Energy's core missions are environmental remediation and research and development. The first could be managed more efficiently by the Department of Defense. The second should be the responsibility of private-sector energy providers. Thus, while DOE still performs a few functions that are likely to continue as federal responsibilities, these functions in no way justify continuing the U.S. Department of Energy as an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<li>The Civilian Nuclear Waste Management program is financed by the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). The NWF is financed by a per-kilowatt tax on nuclear power producers. There currently is more than $10 billion in the NWF (of which $4 billion has already been spent).

Any savings achieved through corporatization should be returned to energy providers as a tax reduction or credit. Once OCRWM is privatized, the complete balance of the NWF would be returned to the energy producers, who then would pay OCRWM directly through disposal prices.

<title>Time To Permit Oil Drilling In the Arctic Refuge</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO PERMIT OIL DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 432<br>
October 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is the subject of heated debate as some Members of Congress, led by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Representative Don Young (R-AK), attempt to open a small fraction of the area to oil exploration and production. A provision included in the budget reconciliation would open the Coastal Plain area of ANWR. This effort is a sensible approach that could dramatically expand much-needed domestic oil production with negligible impact on the environment.
<p>
	ANWR is an enormous area of land located in the Northeast corner of Alaska within the Arctic Circle. Contrary to the image evoked by opponents of oil production, that ANWR is the last small pristine area left in Alaska, the state has an abundance of hardy ecosystems. In addition to the healthy ecosystems existing on millions of acres of private and state land, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 set aside 100 million acres of land as parks, refuges, and preserves, including 57 million acres of wilderness. ANWR itself covers 19.8 million acres. While eight million acres of ANWR were set aside as wilderness, 1.5 million acres were designated for review by the Department of Interior (DOI) to recommend future management of high potential oil resources. In 1987, DOI recommended that this 1.5 million acres, known as the Coastal Plain, be leased for oil and gas exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive manner.
<p>
	The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would implement DOI's recommendation. But only a tiny fraction -- far less than one percent -- of the Coastal Plain area would be affected. Advancing technology over the last 20 years has reduced the necessary size or "footprint" of drilling operations to less than one-fifth of what was required, say, at Prudhoe Bay. So exploration and production would affect only about 2,000 acres. To put this in perspective, that is an area about one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., and about 0.01 percent of the total area of ANWR. Even in this very limited area, modern sophisticated operations adopt many environmentally sensitive methods which further limit any ecological impact.
<p>
	Expanded oil production is badly needed. The United States currently imports more than half its oil consumption, and reliance on foreign oil is growing. That raises national security concerns and is an unwelcome factor in foreign policy considerations. This reliance caused a $51 billion oil trade deficit last year -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Foreign energy dependence would be eased considerably if the Coastal Plain produced oil. The area potentially could produce 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least a quarter of a century, thereby increasing domestic production by almost 25 percent. Allowing limited drilling in ANWR also would reduce the trade deficit by about $14 billion per year. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal revenues from lease sales would be $1.3 billion over the next seven years, helping to trim the budget deficit.
<p>
	Alaska's residents would be big beneficiaries of lease sales. Alaska has agreed to split the estimated $2.6 billion revenue from lease sales evenly with the federal government (rather than take the 90 percent to which the state otherwise would be entitled), so the state still will receive $1.3 billion. This partially explains why three-quarters of Alaskans support the plan.
<p>
	Not only will Alaskans and the federal treasury benefit from increased oil production, but an estimated 222,000-732,000 jobs will be created throughout the country. There will be new hires in the oil industry and manufacturers, suppliers, and transporters of oil-related equipment will increase hiring dramatically, with fully 98 percent of these jobs in the lower 48 states. Based on a mid-range estimate of job creation, this one action would drop the unemployment rate by 0.36 percentage points.1
<p>
	The only potentially legitimate objection to opening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil drilling would be on environmental grounds. But these concerns are without merit because of the very limited impact of modern drilling and production techniques. Even the "pro-environment" native Inupiat Eskimos, who live in or near the Coastal Plain and opposed oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay 60 miles away, support onshore oil development in the area. As Inupiat Mayor George Ahmagak of the North Slope Borough wrote last June, "Our whalers and hunters make maximum use of our few resources, always taking care not to harm the land so their grandchildren may in turn carry on their culture.... As Mayor, I can state unequivocally that the people of the North Slope Borough enthusiastically support the presence of the oil industry in our land.... The wisdom of our Elders teaches us the value of hunting where game is most plentiful. Likewise, it makes sense for our nation to seek oil in an area that even [DOI] has identified as the country's best prospect for new petroleum deposits."2
<p>
	Exploration is opposed by the Gwich'in Indians, who live 120 miles south and have strong ties to the environmental lobby. They are concerned about protecting their hunt of 300-350 animals from the 152,000 porcupine caribou. While the herd size has fallen from its high of 180,000 a few years ago, oil drilling is unlikely to have any negative impact. One reason for this confidence is that the Central Arctic caribou herd living in the Prudhoe Bay area already has increased its population over sevenfold since oil production began 20 years ago, despite dire warnings at the time that the herd would decline sharply if oil drilling was permitted. In fact, the second-largest oil field in the U.S. is the favorite place for caribou to give birth. 
<p>
	 The facts are clear. Permitting oil production in ANWR would spur economic growth, cut the trade deficit, and ease national security concerns. Moreover, it poses virtually no threat to the environment. It is time for Congress to give the green light to limited exploration and production.

INTRODUCTION

<P>   After eighteen high-level hearings, and a review of 29,000 pages
of written material and hundreds of proposals, the Energy Department
earlier this year released its National Energy Strategy. Known as the
NES, this is a wide-ranging list of particular recommendations for
every type of energy and just about every energy issue.
<P>   The report comes at a time of much confusion about America's
energy situation and the policies that will best guarantee America's
energy security. For example, figures recently released by the Energy
Department show the country's oil imports dropping by around 1 million
barrels per day or 12 percent of the country's total use. While some
observers might thus assume that there is no energy problem, in the
long term America's energy needs will increase. More energy will have
to be produced domestically or imported from overseas. In addition,
Congress is considering a higher gas tax. Such a tax would increase
costs for consumers and businesses, reducing American competitiveness
and lowering American living standards. At the levels of taxes being
discussed, perhaps ten cents per gallon, oil consumption would not be
significantly reduced. A tax of, say, 50 cents per gallon would reduce
consumption dramatically -- by bringing the American economy to a
halt. This is hardly a result acceptable to most policy makers.

<P> Sound Recommendations. On the whole, the report is well balanced
and its recommendations sound. Its major dual message is the need to
reduce or eliminate government regulations that discourage energy
production and the need to free entrepreneurs to meet America's energy
needs. 

<P> As important as what the NES does, however, is what the NES does
not do. In particular, it avoids many of the disastrous errors of the
1970s, when the federal government believed that it could control
America's energy supply and demand. The results of this are well
known: soaring energy prices, block-long gas lines, and uncertainty
about America's energy and economic future. To be sure, there are
shortcomings. The NES does tend to call for government research in
energy areas that might best be left to the private sector. And in
some cases the report could be more emphatic about the need for market
reforms. But if policy makers do follow the NES roadmap, in general
they will be taking America down the path to energy security.

<P> Among NES topics and recommendations:

<P> Energy Production and Efficiency. To promote both production and
efficiency, the NES suggests more deregulation of local electrical
monopolies, strict market pricing for electricity, and federal
government purchases of natural gas vehicles.

<P> Domestic Oil. To increase the domestic oil supply, the NES
recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer
Continental Shelf to oil exploration.

<P> Western Hemisphere Energy Security. To reduce America's reliance
on oil from the politically unstable Middle East without raising costs
to consumers, the NES emphasizes negotiating freer energy trade and
investment in the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Natural Gas. To make maximum use of this clean energy source,
found in abundance in America, the NES suggests, among other things,
deregulating pipeline construction and pricing and removing
restrictions on imports and exports of natural gas.

<P> Domestic Coal. To make better use of this resource, also found
in abundance in America, the NES recommends a consistent and
predictable, rather than arbitrary, application of environmental laws,
using coal slurry pipelines and preventing the Environmental
Protection Agency from mandating specific technology and production
methods for coal plants.

<P> Nuclear Energy. The NES points out that this is a safe, non-
polluting energy source, and suggests research to develop better
designs for nuclear plants, to reform licensing procedures, and to
increase the potential sites for nuclear waste disposal.

<P> Renewable Energy and Electricity. The NES recommends removing
licensing restrictions on hydroelectric plants and continuing research
into nuclear fusion.
<P> A major NES failing is the scant attention that it gives some
key issues. For one thing, tax policy needs an overhaul. While the NES
suggests modest changes in the tax code, what is needed is a
restoration of all those tax code pressures dealing with the energy
industry that Congress has eliminated since 1969.

<P> For another thing, the NES should be more emphatic about
developing a Western Hemisphere common market for energy to diversify
supplies and reduce dependence on the Middle East. 

<P> These deficiencies, however, are dwarfed by the achievement of
the NES in presenting, for the first time, a comprehensive review of
America's energy situation and in offering many market-oriented
proposals for America's future energy security. 

<P> The NES already is prompting action on Capitol Hill. On June 4
the Senate Energy Committee approved S.1220, the National Energy
Security Act, co-sponsored by Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana
Democrat, and Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican. Essentially
similar to the Bush Administration's NES, the bill faces an uncertain
fate. Many amendments could be added to it that would make America
less energy secure. The House of Representatives is working on its own
version of a comprehensive energy bill. 

<P> The Free Market Acts. When Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait about a
year ago, crude oil prices shot to record levels. Some lawmakers urged
a return to the interventionist energy policies of the 1970s. The Bush
Administration wisely resisted this. Although the Iraqi crisis reduced
world crude oil production by 4.1 million barrels per day, roughly the
same as the 1973 Arab oil boycott and 1979 Iranian oil embargo, thanks
to the Bush Administration's response, the results were entirely
different. In both 1973 and 1979, emergency government controls
greatly aggravated the effects of the disruption. In 1990, the
Administration allowed the market to operate freely. As a result, the
oil price rise was brief, peaking last October. By this February oil
prices fell to below prewar levels. There were no 1970s-style gas
lines.

<P> History demonstrates that the best government role in the energy
sector is to assure that markets operate without hindrance. Markets,
as even East European leaders now recognize, are the most efficient
means of allocating resources. Yet federal government restrictions
continue to impede the market's function in energy. Removing these
obstacles deserves a high priority if America is to achieve energy
security. 
<P>
AMERICA'S ENERGY SITUATION

<P> The United States is a country rich in energy. Domestic coal,
natural gas, and oil are pillars of America's energy base. Still,
current patterns of production and consumption will have to change in
the future as known resources are exhausted. 

<P> Fossil fuels account for 89.2 percent of all energy used in the
U.S. Oil is America's most important energy source. Last year, oil
accounted for some 40 percent of American energy use. Next came
natural gas, accounting for 24 percent of consumption, followed by
coal at 23.3 percent. Nuclear energy contributed 7 percent of
America's needs, with the rest coming from hydroelectric dams, and
alternative energy sources. 

<P> Even these figures, though, understate the importance of oil.
Some 97 percent of all transportation energy comes from petroleum.
While alternative fuels have made modest inroads in the transportation
market, it will be a decade or more before they can offset oil
consumption significantly.

<P> This May, Americans used an average of 15,844,000 barrels per
day (b/d) of oil, roughly one million less than in 1990. During this
period, America's oil imports fell by 7.2 percent, from 8,649,000 b/d
to 8,027,000 b/d. Still, America relies on foreign oil for more than
half of its needs. More disturbing, America's oil production fell from
around nine million b/d in 1985 to roughly 7.3 million b/d in 1990, a
decline of almost 19 percent. 

<P> Though the Persian Gulf crisis spurred higher American oil
output, the boost was small and as it turns out, temporary. Of more
fundamental importance is the fact that America's "proved reserves" --
essentially the oil that America has on the shelf -- have declined by
over 27 percent since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.

<P> That America imports great quantities of oil is not, in itself,
a problem. The real concern is whether the level of imports leaves
America vulnerable to severe economic dislocation should foreign oil
supplies suddenly be disrupted. This was the case in the 1970s, when
two sudden and sharp price hikes rocked the American economy. When all
factors are taken into account, the combined effects of the 1973 Arab
oil embargo, and 1979 Iranian oil boycott cost America an astounding
$1.5 trillion between 1974 and 1984. 

<P> And the 1970s oil shocks occurred when U.S. oil imports were far
lower than they are today. America now imports over half its oil
compared with 34.8 percent in 1973. Some 27 percent of imports, or
11.8 percent of American consumption, comes from the Persian Gulf,
primarily from Saudi Arabia. The price hike that followed the invasion
of Kuwait cost American consumers nearly $39 billion in higher oil
prices. 

<P> To hedge against abrupt interruptions of oil supplies from
abroad, the U.S. government maintains 587.5 million barrels of crude
oil stored in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). If all imports
from all sources were cut off, the SPR would last about 75 days at
current rates of consumption. Not much more oil could be obtained at
short notice from American sources. The Energy Department estimates
that even under the most favorable circumstances domestic oil
production in the past year could have been increased by only about
100,000 b/d -- and this would have taken about a year. 

<P> Thus security of supply is a fundamental consideration in
American energy policy. This is recognized by NES. Its recommendations
aim at a secure energy future achieved through market-based actions
that improve efficiency, enhance security of supply, assure a clean
environment, and fortify the foundations of America's energy economy. 
<P>
INCREASING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY

<P> The NES devotes 42 of its 189 pages to energy conservation,
attained by boosting energy efficiency. While it is true that the
document does not call for the sorts of mandates, regulations, and
subsidies that were in favor during the 1970s, the dismal failure of
those measures readily justifies their absence. Instead, the NES makes
concrete suggestions for energy efficiency improvements for
electricity generation, residential and commercial buildings use,
industrial use, and transportation.
<P>
** Electricity

<P> Most electricity is generated by utility companies, which are
local monopolies closely regulated by state and federal authorities.
This system stifles competition and is inefficient. The NES addresses
these shortcomings by seeking increased competition within the
electricity market. To do this, the NES proposes amending the 56-year-
old Public Utility Holding Company Act to permit utilities to build,
own, and operate power plants outside their traditional service area.
The NES also would eliminate size restrictions on so-called
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) -- firms that are not part of a
public utility, but that build and operate plants that sell
electricity to utilities. Current size restrictions prevent IPPs from
competing with traditional utilities for the construction of new
generating capacity. 

<P> The NES also supports efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to allow IPPs to use existing electricity
transmission lines owned by local electric utility monopolies.
Currently, local monopolies need not permit IPPs access to such lines.
To expand operations, IPPs must have access to transmission
facilities.

<P> The NES also recommends eliminating subsidies to the federal
Power Marketing Authorities -- or PMAs. Established in 1906 to
distribute the electricity generated by federal water projects, the
PMAs sell power to their customers at prices below market cost; the
taxpayer absorbs the difference. To date, PMAs have cost the Treasury
$4 billion. As a result, PMA customers predictably waste "inexpensive"
electricity. Phasing out the huge subsidies to PMAs would encourage
conservation and promote general economic efficiency, ending the waste
of taxpayer dollars. 
<P>
** Commercial and Residential Energy Efficiency

<P> Residential use accounts for around 20 percent of American
energy consumption. Each year, 90 million American households spend
around $100 billion for heating, lighting, cooking, and other uses.
Commercial buildings account for about 15 percent of total energy
consumption, and about $70 billion in annual outlays.

<P> Residential use of energy dropped by about one-third between
1962 and 1986 because of efficiency improvements in appliances, and
investments by homeowners in energy-saving measures. Yet the use of
the various kinds of fuel consumed to generate power for homeowners
increased as they shifted away from oil and coal for space heating and
water heating. The fastest growing end users of primary energy,
meanwhile, are commercial buildings, as a result of the spread of air-
conditioning and the proliferation of computers, copiers, printers,
and other office equipment.

<P> A main obstacle identified by the NES to improving residential
and commercial energy efficiency are government regulations that
prevent energy prices from reflecting fully the real costs of
generating the energy. Another obstacle is that government-owned
housing is insulated from market forces and public housing authorities
feel no competitive need to increase energy efficiency. 

<P> NES recommendations for commercial and residential energy mainly
aim to spur research and development and education. The NES recognizes
that conservation must be market-driven. One flaw in the NES
recommendation, however, is the call for government efficiency
standards for residences and commercial buildings. Mandating
efficiency in buildings was attempted in the 1970s without success. 
<P>
** Industrial Energy Efficiency

<P> The industrial sector accounts for about one-quarter of American
energy consumption. Industrial energy conservation as a response to
market forces is one of the great success stories of the American
energy economy. Between 1973 and 1989, the value of goods and services
produced in America rose by 50 percent in real terms; the amount of
energy required to produce these actually fell by 6 percent. Private
industry reflexively responded to high energy prices by conserving
energy. 

<P> The NES's primary recommendation to improve industrial energy
efficiency is additional funding for research and development to help
firms find new ways to use waste as a fuel. Yet industries already
spend an estimated $46 billion annually for pollution control. Thus
industry already has a strong financial incentive to find ways to use
waste as a fuel. This is because the process of using waste products
to generate energy consumes many pollutants. NES also recommends
increased use of energy audits by industry. Such audits permit firms
to identify areas in which they can reduce energy consumption and thus
save money with existing technologies. The federal Department of
Energy's help in this is particularly important for small - and
medium-sized firms, which often lack the technical capability to
perform such audits themselves. 
<P>
** Transportation Energy Use

<P> The greatest opportunity for improving American energy
efficiency is in transportation. Last year Americans spent $200
billion on transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of
petroleum use and one-fourth of total energy consumption. Since 1976,
the amount of oil consumed by transportation has exceeded American
domestic production. Petroleum use for transportation is expected to
continue growing, rising to more than 42 percent of total energy use
by 2010, and to 66 percent by 2030.

<P> For transportation, the most important NES recommendation
encourages the use of alternative fuels. In principle this is sound.
Yet the NES shies away from evaluating specific alternative fuels. The
only exception is the NES recommendation to extend an already existing
tax credit to oil companies for using ethanol. Because of this tax
break, "gasohol," a blend of 10 percent ethanol/90 percent gasoline,
accounts for about 10 percent of the gasoline supply. This means that
ethanol is replacing about 1 percent of the gasoline, a very tiny
amount. The NES should have evaluated the merits of alternative fuels.
Had it done so, it probably would have concluded that natural gas is
the most promising alternative.
<P>
FLEET CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS

<P> For America, natural gas is a good substitute for gasoline for
transportation. First, America has an abundance of natural gas. Were
it used in place of oil in all domestic fleet vehicles, current levels
of consumption could be maintained for more than a half-century.
Second, natural gas is clean burning and, as a gasoline substitute,
would reduce air pollution. 

<P> Natural gas would be best suited as a gasoline substitute in
fleet vehicles operated by a single owner such as a taxi company, a
delivery service, or a local government. Although comprising 6.5
percent of the total vehicle population, fleet vehicles consume
approximately 10 percent of all motor fuel. The $2,000 to $3,000 cost
for converting an engine to burn natural gas is currently a deterrent
to fleet use of this fuel. Were there greater demand, however,
vehicles could be equipped at the factory to use natural gas. This
would cut costs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Chrysler Corporation
and General Motors plan to establish experimental production lines for
alternative fueled cars and trucks. United Parcel Service and other
firms are converting part of their fleets. Local governments too may
want to buy natural gas vehicles to help meet air quality regulations.
Even at the current prices, the cost of converting fleets to natural
gas, the amount can be recovered in slightly over three years thanks
to lower fuel and operating costs. 

<P> Fueling Federal Fleets. The NES wisely calls for more public
education on the benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. Better still
is the NES suggestion that the federal government buy natural gas
vehicles for its fleets. The federal government owns more than 200,000
motor vehicles, and in fiscal 1990 alone purchased 49,188 civilian
vehicles. Federal purchases of natural gas vehicles would create
enough demand to justify the mass production lines that significantly
reduce costs. 

<P> This April 17, George Bush issued an Executive Order requiring
federal agencies to purchase as many alternative-fuel vehicles as
possible, and to compute cost/benefit ratios for the purchases on a
"lifecycle costing" basis. This means that the total cost of owning
and operating the vehicle over its useful life, rather than just its
purchase price, will be how a vehicle's cost is reckoned.

<P> Local governments, meanwhile, also could spur use of natural gas
by permitting gas utilities to supply natural gas for the vehicle fuel
market. Such sales would be part of what is termed a utility's "non-
core" business, which is not regulated because it is not part of a
utility's local monopoly. Allowing utilities to sell natural gas for
vehicles would introduce new competition and reduce fuel costs. 

<P> Increased demand for natural gas as a fuel for vehicles will cut
the prices of all aspects of this market. Example: It now costs from
$2,500 to $3,500 to buy a home compressor which can be attached to a
residential natural gas line to fuel a natural gas vehicle. If mass-
produced, the price could drop to under $1,000. A gas utility could
install such a unit and recover its cost over, say, five years through
fuel sales. As the number of natural gas vehicles increased, utilities
could also install natural gas compressors at gasoline filling
stations. Several already exist in the Washington, D.C., area. To do
this, however, utilities must be allowed to sell natural gas fuel as a
non-core business.
<P>
DOMESTIC OIL SECURITY

<P> The principal problems addressed by the NES are the potential
dangers to America's energy supplies. Oil is the most important
component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for 42 percent of all
energy consumed and more than 97 percent of all transportation fuel.
Last year Americans consumed an average of 17 million b/d. U.S.
domestic production, however, has been falling, from just under 9
million b/d in 1985 to 7.3 million b/d in 1990. This is roughly 19
percent in domestic oil production. As a result, last year Americans
paid some $55 billion for net oil imports. This figure could rise to
$200 billion by 2010 according to Energy Department statistics. In the
first half of the year oil imports actually fell by one million b/d,
or about 12 percent of the total from the previous year. But this was
due to factors other than a change in America's long-term energy
production and consumption trends. First, due to uncertainty over the
situation in the Persian Gulf, American oil companies drew on their
own stored supplies and therefore required less imports. And second,
the recession dampened oil consumption, thereby reducing some of the
need for imported and domestically produced oil. The NES recommends
reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil "shocks" by encouraging increased
domestic oil production.
<P>
** The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

<P> The NES recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR) to oil exploration. Originally established in 1980 under
Section 1002 of the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
ANWR covers 19 million acres of Alaska's northernmost territory. About
8 percent of this area holds high promise for petroleum exploration.
According to the Energy Department, it may contain more oil than
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest North American oil field discovered
to date. 

<P> Opponents of exploration in ANWR claim that development would
harm wildlife. Yet more than a decade of experience at Prudhoe Bay,
which steadily produces an average of 1.8 million b/d of oil,
demonstrates that oil can be extracted in the Arctic without damaging
the environment. The 1990 Exxon Valdez spill occurred because of
deficiencies in the transportation system, not in drilling. 

<P> Oil output from production in Prudhoe Bay soon will begin
declining. Unless ANWR is developed, output from Alaska will steadily
fall. With ANWR, however, Alaska could keep pumping around 1.8 million
b/d or even more. The NES conservatively estimates ANWR's potential
output at 870,000 b/d by the year 2005. Oil from ANWR also would
extend the life of the Prudhoe Bay field. This is because without
ANWR, the volume of oil from Prudhoe Bay eventually will fall below
the level required to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
<P>
** The Outer Continental Shelf

<P> The NES also recommends expanded drilling for new oil on the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), a portion of the Continental Plate
extending underneath the ocean's surface. The OCS is believed to
contain 7.5 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas; this would be 26 percent of America's undiscovered oil
and natural resources.    The Reagan Administration proposed orderly
development of OCS oil and gas resources in a way that would protect
the environment. This was blocked by a series of lawsuits and
congressional actions. Development of the OCS was further delayed when
the Bush Administration halted leasing in several OCS areas including
the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, the North Atlantic
coast, and a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. This leaves only
portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Mid and South Atlantic available
for development. The freeze on new leases apparently remains in force
for most of these areas until 1996, ostensibly to allow environmental
and economic studies. Some OCS areas off California, however, will not
be available for leasing until the year 2000. 

<P> Environmental concerns obviously are important. But so is
American energy security. The two do not exclude each other.
Technological advances in recent years have reduced significantly the
chances of spills from offshore drilling. In fact, there have been no
major spills at U.S. offshore facilities since 1969 when a well off
the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out, fouling miles of
beach. Safety measures developed as a result of this spill make a re-
occurrence unlikely. Today, indeed, there is far less environmental
risk from drilling offshore wells and transporting oil to shore by
pipeline than there is from transporting oil from other nations by
tankers. 

<P> The NES recommends that those areas in which leasing has been
halted be considered for inclusion in a five-year leasing plan being
drafted by the Department of the Interior. The NES also suggests that
Congress ban none of the new areas under consideration for the five-
year leasing plan until a study is completed that weighs resource
potential and environmental effects of energy development.
<P>
** The Tax Problem

<P> For more than two decades, unfavorable tax treatment of the oil
industry has contributed significantly to the decline of American
domestic oil production. Addressing this, the NES recommends some tax
code changes. These would give somewhat more favorable tax treatment
to so-called "marginal oil production." This is the output from wells
that are nearly exhausted. The NES also calls for better tax treatment
for "unconventional" natural gas production, such as that from coal
seams. 

<P> In its proposed tax changes, the NES stops far short of what is
needed to remove the tax code's penalties on domestic oil production.
The oil industry is treated more harshly by the tax code than any
other sector of the economy. Since 1969, for example, most oil
producers have lost what is knowm as "the depletion allowance." This
is the accounting mechanism that recognizes that as oil is extracted
from the ground, the oil company's capital is depleted -- just as a
manufacturing firm's capital would be depleted as machinery
deteriorated. The depletion allowance for mineral development is the
equivalent of depreciation for a manufacturing business. It is an
allowance that is used as a deduction from taxable income. Loss of the
depletion allowance of course drives up the cost of oil production in
America.

<P> Also driving up the cost is the 1976 law, enacted by Congress
and approved by Gerald Ford, that imposes a minimum tax on what it
called "intangible drilling costs." These typically are the costs of
building roads to oil well sites, of the "muds" used to lubricate the
rotating shaft of an oil rig, and of the energy used to operate the
rig. Such costs from 1976 to last year were taxed at 10 percent of
their value. Last year's tax hike package boosted this tax to 24
percent. The tiny tax credit given to the oil industry last year
offers little real relief. Why drilling costs themselves should be
taxed is, of course, the question. In every other industry these would
be treated as normal business expenses to be deducted from revenues.
Yet for oil drillers they are effectively treated as income.

<P> Further adding to the burden on the oil industry is the 1980
special tax on oil companies to finance the Superfund, the federal
program to clean hazardous waste sites. Other taxes harm the oil
industry as well. Taxes on refined petroleum products were increased
several times for such diverse reasons as to fund mass transit and
help reduce the deficit. These taxes are imposed specifically on the
oil industry; other industries do not pay them.    A 1987 Energy
Department report on energy security concludes that American oil
production would be increased were the full depletion allowance
restored. The report also calls for a 5 percent tax credit for oil
exploration and development costs and for the removal of tax penalties
on the industry. Taken together, these changes would add 1,233,000 b/d
to domestic production within a decade. While the 1987 report also
found that these changes would reduce Treasury revenues by $7.622
billion over roughly the same period, it failed to take into account
the new revenues that would be received by the Treasury from wages
paid to workers employed to develop the new oil, and from royalties on
oil and gas produced on federal lands. With these new revenues, the
Treasury would collect an extra $40 billion over the decade.
<P>
WESTERN HEMISPHERIC ENERGY SECURITY

<P> The NES strongly supports developing non-Persian Gulf oil
supplies. The NES specifically targets Eastern Europe and the Western
Hemisphere for development. The NES also urges a review of U.S. laws
to ensure they do not discourage energy development. If production
outside the Persian Gulf is not encouraged, 41 percent of world oil
supplies will come from that region by the year 2010. Known oil
reserves outside the Persian Gulf total about 337 billion barrels;
this is about half the 654 billion barrel reserve in the Persian Gulf.

<P> The greatest opportunity for expanding secure production outside
the Persian Gulf is in the Western Hemisphere. The nations of North
and South America have proved oil reserves of over 156 billion barrels
and natural gas reserves of over 518 trillion cubic feet. The
hemisphere also has 30 percent of the world's coal reserves and 42
percent of its hydroelectric power capacity. 

<P> Latin American countries, of course, generally are more
politically stable and friendlier to the U.S. than are Middle Eastern
countries. 

<P> To increase use of the Western Hemisphere's energy resources,
energy trade should be allowed to flow freely across the borders of
all nations in the Americas through the creation of a common market
for energy. The Western Hemisphere readily could meet its own energy
needs, and even export energy. Latin America could produce as much as
3.5 million more b/d. 

<P> For Latin America, increased energy trade with the U.S. could
help reduce the enormous Latin American foreign debt. For the U.S.,
increased reliance on hemispheric energy sources would improve energy
security. To increase cooperation on energy trade within the
hemisphere, a number of steps must be taken. One of the most important
is the elimination of barriers to foreign investment common in Latin
America. 

<P> The U.S. and Canada made a good start towards a hemispheric
common market in energy with their 1988 Free Trade Area agreement. It
provides for unrestricted oil and electricity trade across borders.
Natural gas so far is not covered by the agreement, since it is highly
regulated in both countries. 

<P> A key element to an energy free trade area would be the
reduction and eventual elimination of laws, especially in Mexico and
the Latin American countries, that prohibit foreign investment in
resource development, or set confiscatory tax rates on profits from
such investments.
<P>
** The Venezuelan Example

<P> A promising development is the proposed Cristobal/Colon joint
venture in Venezuela. The project involves the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Venezuela to the U.S. The partners include
Exxon Corporation, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsubishi Corporation,
and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan National
Oil Company. This is the first time in decades that Venezuela is
permitting foreign participation in an energy project. Venezuela is
expected soon to revise its tax laws to make the Cristobal/Colon
project economically viable. A successful Cristobal/Colon project
could serve as a model for cooperation throughout the Hemisphere. The
government of Argentina, meanwhile, is privatizing its oil industry,
one of the most inefficient in the Hemisphere. This should increase
production and foreign participation and give Argentina an incentive
to seek freer energy trade in the Hemisphere. Though Mexico still
resists privatizing its oil industry or allowing foreign companies to
own equity shares in the industry, this will be addressed in the
current U.S.-Mexico free trade area talks.
<P>
DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS

<P> Natural gas accounts for more than one-fifth of America's
primary energy, and is used to heat nearly half of all homes. The NES
cites natural gas as one of the most promising alternatives to oil,
suggesting that it could replace up to 600,000 b/d of oil use by 1995,
and 1.7 million b/d by 2000. 

<P> Natural gas when burned as fuel produces less air pollution than
oil or coal, and the technology to convert from oil to natural gas is
well established. Most important, America has natural gas in vast
quantities.

<P> Natural gas competes directly with oil in the industrial boiler
fuel market, with natural gas accounting for 37 percent and oil only
36 percent of all industrial energy used in 1989. Coal accounts for
most of the balance. Virtually all of the oil burned in industrial
boilers, or roughly 24.7 percent of total American oil consumption,
could be replaced by natural gas. Many boilers are designed to use
either fuel and can be switched back and forth in response to the
relative price of the two fuels. 
<P>
** Pipeline Construction Barriers

<P> The NES finds that statutory and regulatory impediments are
reducing American natural gas usage by 1 trillion cubic feet per year.
This amount could displace 470,000 b/d of oil. In some cases,
particularly in the Northeast, industrial boilers cannot use natural
gas because there are no pipelines to deliver it. Pipeline
construction often is stymied by a federal regulatory approval process
which can take five times as long as it does for the actual pipeline
to be built. 

<P> The cumbersome regulatory system was designed in the days when
some pipeline firms enjoyed near monopoly power in some regions.
Today, with over 1.3 million miles of pipeline and a choice of routes
available in most cases, monopoly no longer is a problem. Yet the
antiquated approval process remains, hurting rather than protecting
the consumer. Reducing regulations would speed pipeline construction,
significantly lower transportation costs, and make natural gas more
attractive as a fuel.

<P> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the body that
oversees approval of interstate natural gas pipelines and regulates
their rates, recognizes the problem and is trying to reform its
procedures administratively with the support of the Bush White House.
The NES endorses this and suggests clarifying confusing provisions of
the 1938 Natural Gas Policy Act. It recommends that pipeline companies
be allowed to proceed without federal certification if they forego the
right to exercise federal eminent domain in obtaining the private
property needed for the pipeline. Under current regulations, federal
certification of a pipeline entitles the pipeline company to invoke
eminent domain.
<P>
** Natural Gas Pipeline Pricing

<P> The price that natural gas pipelines charge for their services
has been regulated by Washington since the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
The NES calls for a reversal of this and for deregulation of pipeline
prices so long as pipeline customers have access to alternative
sources of energy supplies. Today, pipeline companies can refuse to
transport natural gas for producers not affiliated with them. But
because these companies usually enjoy a monopoly in their service
areas, such refusals restrict competition. Requiring pipeline
companies with local, government-supported monopolies to transport
natural gas for other companies would improve competition.

<P> The NES recommends reforming the pipeline rate structure to
encourage efficient use. Current rules often force pipeline owners to
charge higher prices for their services during periods of low use, to
cover the pipeline costs even though demand is low. Conversely, during
periods of peak use, pipeline owners are forced to underprice their
services to avoid making profits higher than those allowed by the
regulators. The NES suggests that FERC permit pipeline owners to sell
their excess capacity during periods of low use, and to buy additional
capacity from other pipelines during peak periods. This would help
even out the pipeline transportation load and increase efficiency. 
<P>
** Regulation of Gas Imports and Exports

<P> Natural gas imports and exports are regulated by the Department
of Energy. America last year imported about 8 percent of its natural
gas, primarily from Canada. By the year 2000, American natural gas
imports are expected to rise to around 12 percent of natural gas
consumption, and by 2010 to 14 percent. The U.S exports a small amount
of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Vast amounts of Alaskan natural gas
could be sold to Japan were it not for the federal limits on exports.
The NES recommends ending the Energy Department's authority over gas
import and export transactions. 

<P>
DOMESTIC COAL

<P> Coal is America's most abundant fuel, accounting for 90 percent
of American energy resources. Coal use has grown sharply in recent
years. In 1970, for example, the U.S. consumed 523.2 million tons of
coal, in 1980, 702.7 million tons, and in 1990, 894.6 million tons,
accounting for 23 percent of American energy needs. By 2010, American
coal use could rise to 1.6 billion tons. Coal also is a major export,
with more than 100 million tons sold last year. Increased use of coal,
however, could be hindered by the tightened environmental regulations
in the Clean Air Act of 1990. The NES cites the Energy Department's
Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program, initiated in 1986, as a way to
permit increased coal use and still protect the environment. To
accelerate the CCT program, the NES recommends reforming federal coal
leasing policies, reforming regulations concerning coal mining safety
and health, and encouraging greater use of coal slurry pipelines. 
<P>
** Promoting Coal Production

<P> The Clean Coal Technology Program aims at developing new
technologies to burn coal cleaner, with less pollution. For the CCT to
succeed, sufficient quantities of low-sulfur coal must be burned. Much
of this type of coal is on federal land. The NES recommends that the
Department of Interior's Federal Coal Leasing Program insure that
adequate low-sulfur coal areas are offered for lease. At the same
time, NES calls on the Bureau of Mines to continue research and
development on technologies to address environmental concerns about
underground coal mining. It also calls for continued tax credits for
extracting the marketable methane gas found in the underground coal
beds. 
<P>
** Regulatory Reform 

<P> The NES stresses the need to eliminate the uncertainty about the
kind of environmental regulations that are to be imposed under the
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This act has been
inconsistently applied. Reform is especially important to low-sulfur
coal production, most of which is extracted from surface mines.

<P> The NES also calls for performance-based standards for mine
safety and health regulations. Adopting performance-based standards,
where results, rather than specific federally-imposed methods, are
used to measure compliance, will permit a more rapid introduction of
technological improvements and improve worker safety.
<P>
** Coal Slurry Pipelines

<P> Coal slurry pipelines, in which pulverized coal mixed with water
is transported as a liquid, reduce coal transportation costs. Since
almost all prospective slurry pipeline routes will cross over or under
highways, rail lines, and other private property, slurry pipelines
require that government exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain
the right-of-way for the pipelines. This is done for right-of-way for
electric wires, roads, and rails. Because slurry pipelines use large
amounts of water, there has been great opposition to granting pipeline
builders eminent domain in Western states where water is scarce. Yet
large deposits of low-sulfur coal are in the West, and rail transport
of the coal to Eastern markets is much more costly than transport by
slurry pipelines. The NES correctly supports granting eminent domain
to slurry pipeline builders once all questions concerning water rights
and usage have been satisfied.
<P>
** Clean Air Act Amendments

<P> The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates that annual emissions of
sulfur dioxide in the U.S. by the year 2000 will be at least 10
million tons below the 1980 level. The act further decrees that the
emissions level reached in the year 2000 will never be exceeded. The
act requires existing coal-burning electric utility plants to install
expensive devices to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. 

<P> These new requirements could seriously constrain American coal
use. While accepting the clean air goal set by the 1990 act, the NES
stresses that the goal can be met by accelerating the Clean Coal
Technology Program. This would be much less costly to the economy than
the devices called for by the Clean Air Act.
<P>
** The WEPCO Decision

<P> When the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, most existing
electrical generating plants were exempted from the new air quality
rules. At the time it was assumed that existing plants soon would be
replaced by new facilities that would be subject to the law. Yet, as
the expense and difficulties associated with building new electrical
generating plants increased, utilities typically decided to refurbish
existing plants rather than build new ones. In 1988, a decision by the
Environmental Protection Agency involving a plant refurbished by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) held that when a utility
makes "non-routine" changes in the operation, repair, or maintenance
of a unit, the plant may become subject to air quality rules. This
meant that the utility was required to install specific pollution
control devices mandated by regulations.

<P> Skyrocketing Cost. The effect of this decision on the WEPCO
plant was enormous. The capital cost for refurbishment jumped from $80
million to $120 million. It became necessary to cut the plant's size
from 400 megawatts to 320 megawatts. As a result, the cost of re-
outfitting the WEPCO plant rose by 87.5 percent overall. Worse still,
the EPA indicated that it will determine what constitutes a "non-
routine" refurbishment case by case. As a result, utilities deciding
how to meet future power requirements must assume that any
refurbishment will fall under the WEPCO precedent. 

<P> The WEPCO decision illustrates the uncertainties that the
inconsistent and unpredictable application of regulations can
introduce into the market. The NES correctly suggests that the Energy
Department work with the EPA to identify the areas of regulation that
create planning uncertainties for electric utilities with older
plants, and strive to make the revisions necessary to clarify them. A
more basic question, however, as with the WEPCO decision, is whether
the EPA will continue to resist performance-based standards for public
utilities. Unlike the more traditional command and control "cookbook"
approach, such standards emphasize results. If EPA resists this
approach, the Administration should take direct action against EPA to
assure the adoption of such sound policy.
<P>
NUCLEAR POWER

<P> Although nuclear plants generate around 20 percent of American
electricity, for all practical purposes American nuclear energy
development is at a standstill. Because of public opposition and
excessive regulation, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in
America since 1978; only three remain scheduled for construction. More
than 100 orders have been cancelled or deferred. 

<P> Still, nuclear energy remains an attractive way to generate
electricity. It is clean and relatively safe. America has huge
deposits of uranium, the source of nuclear fuel. The NES estimates
that America will need from 190 gigawatts to 275 gigawatts of new
electrical generation capacity by the year 2010 (a gigawatt is one
billion watts). Currently it takes two coal-fired plants or one
nuclear plant to produce a gigawatt. Most of America's added energy
will be generated by large, centralized plants, known as "base load
generation." These are best suited to nuclear power.

<P> To give nuclear energy a new chance, the NES addresses several
important issues.
<P>
** Advanced Powerplant Designs

<P> The accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl facility in Ukraine in 1986
heightened public concern over plant safety. Since 1979, the
Department of Energy has been researching advanced light-water
reactors (ALWRs), which will be safer than current designs. By 1995,
the ALWR design should be complete and a prototype could be operating
by 2000. Other advanced designs are also being developed. Among the
most promising is the Modular High-Temperature Gas Reactor. With it,
if all external power systems were to fail, the reactor would simply
shut itself down. The NES endorses these research and development
efforts.
<P>
** Licensing Reform and Design Standardization

<P> Delays encountered in licensing nuclear power plants long have
been among the nuclear industry's greatest problems. The licensing
process in America can take up to fifteen years compared to less than
five years in Japan or France. Unlike other governments, Washington
reserves key licensing approvals until after a plant is built. As a
result, a utility can have a completed plant costing a billion dollars
sitting idle because of a regulatory delay.

<P> This process is complicated further by the tendency of electric
utilities to order unique designs for each plant. This subjects each
plant to its own exhaustive review process. In France and Japan, by
contrast, it has long been the practice to use standardized models for
nuclear plants. Besides reducing licensing delays, standardization is
believed to improve safety by reducing the number of new and untried
components. The NES agrees that power plant designs should be
standardized so that reviews need take place only once. 
<P>
** Managing High-Level Nuclear Waste

<P> Another major problem facing the nuclear industry is the growing
backlog of undisposed high-level nuclear waste, that is, highly
radioactive byproducts of nuclear power production that require
special disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directs the
Department of Energy to establish a permanent repository for such
waste, and a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to hold the
waste prior to permanent disposal. Yet just about all localities
strongly oppose being the site of these repositories. As with other
problems facing the nuclear industry, establishing these repositories
is as much a matter of public perception as of technology. Although
the NES suggests that Congress establish disposal sites, the political
battle surrounding such decisions will result in further delays.
<P>
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

<P> Renewable energy sources are those that are not depleted. The
three principal renewable sources in America are hydroelectric power,
geothermal power, and ethanol, produced from corn, grains, and other
biological material. Solar power is a much less important renewable
source. In 1990, renewable energy supplied 8 percent of American
energy needs. Of this, about 47 percent came from hydroelectric dams.
Solar power of all types accounted for under 6 percent of all
renewable energy and less than one half of one percent of American
energy needs. Renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric power
or wood have grown in importance significantly since 1970, when they
were virtually nonexistent. The NES strongly endorses the use of
renewable energy, and calls for continued research and development in
this area. 
<P>
** Renewable Energy and Electricity

<P> The NES recommends removing from the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) restrictions on the size of renewable
energy plants. These restrictions are a holdover from the Carter
Administration's emphasis on so-called "soft-path" energy schemes,
which emphasized small-scale plants. These provisions made neither
economic nor technological sense.

<P> All hydro-electric plants are licensed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and the licenses periodically must be renewed.
The licensing process has become extremely cumbersome. The NES
suggests exempting very small hydro projects from FERC regulation, and
streamlining the licensing process for all other plants.
<P>
** Ethanol

<P> In 1978, Congress allowed a five-cent per gallon exemption from
the federal gasoline tax for motor fuels blended with ethanol. And in
1980, the federal government granted a tax credit for refiners
producing gasoline blended with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), an
ethanol-based gasoline additive. Because ethanol is more expensive
than gasoline, its advocates believe a tax credit is warranted to
allow ethanol to compete with gasoline. A look at the performance of
ethanol in the market, however, suggests that such a credit is not
needed. With around 10 percent of all gasoline being blended with
ethanol or ETBE the need for the subsidy has passed. Ethanol is well
established in the market and now competes with gasoline additives in
about the same price range, rather than with gasoline. Clean Air Act
of 1990 regulations effectively require many motorists in urban areas
to use gasoline with ethanol, ETBE, or some similar additive. The NES
thus errs in recommending that the ethanol tax credit continue.
Instead, the subsidies for ethanol and ETBE should be eliminated. 
<P>
** Fusion

<P> Fusion long has held out the promise of tapping a virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy without endangering the environment and
without producing hazardous wastes. The NES calls for continued
support of fusion energy research. This is wise, yet too much should
not be expected of fusion soon. Under the most optimistic assessments,
the first practical fusion energy plants will not be available until
the year 2035. 
<P>
IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

<P> The needs to make America more energy secure and to protect the
environment too often have been in conflict. Measures designed to
protect the environment often wasted energy or restricted the use of
such plentiful sources as coal. 

<P> The NES emphasizes the need to clarify uncertainties about some
environmental issues that have impeded energy development. Typical of
these issues are the claims about global climate change. NES stresses
that research on these issues is essential before imposing regulations
that could have disastrous economic consequences for American
industries. The NES does call for measures to reduce the emission of
"greenhouse gases," which may contribute to atmospheric warming, while
the global warming issue is being studied. But NES specifies that
these measures be limited to those justified for reasons other than
potential global climate change.

<P> The NES wisely rejects the notion of a so-called "carbon tax" to
discourage fossil fuel use. Some environmentalists call for a $135-
per-ton tax on the carbon content of fuels. This would damage the
American economy enormously. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P> In the past, talk in Washington of an "energy policy" has meant
cumbersome regulations, expensive new bureaucracies, and costly
"conservation" programs and gas lines. How much energy, if any, is
saved by these measures is debatable. What is not debatable is the
enormous economic pain inflicted on Americans. A sound energy policy
is not built on more regulations. A sound policy rather should remove
impediments to the energy market, eliminate barriers to energy
production, and facilitate innovation. This is what the National
Energy Strategy recommends. America's level of foreign oil imports is
too high -- not because oil imports are "bad" for America but because
dependence on oil from unfriendly and insecure parts of the world
carries the risk of future damaging economic shocks. 

<P> Removing Tax Bias. America can increase domestic energy
production and increase exploration to find new reserves if Congress
and the White house amend the tax code to remove the bias against
firms taking the risks necessary to find new energy supplies, if
Congress and the White House allow exploration in the most promising
areas for new oil discoveries, if Congress and the White House remove
the regulatory impediments now discouraging gas producers and
utilities from fostering greater use of natural gas, and if Congress
and the White House encourage conservation by permitting the market to
reflect the true cost of energy. 

<P> Americans, too, could move closer to secure foreign sources of
supply if the U.S. were to negotiate a common market for energy
throughout the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Core Strategy. Americans enjoy one of the world's highest
standards of living in large part because they have had ready access
to abundant, inexpensive sources of energy. Continued access to
abundant energy is essential to America's economic future, and history
teaches that the best way to achieve this access is to permit markets
to operate. Reliance on markets assures both abundant supplies and
judicious use. As such, above all else, the core of any national
energy strategy must be to permit markets to operate.

<title>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With a National Sales Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<br>

<center>
<h3>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With A National Sales Tax</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
This proposal is aimed at addressing the basic problems afflicting the U.S. economy, as well as liberating Americans from the intrusive burden of the income tax.<p>
We cannot raise wages, create new jobs, or eliminate our national debt if the American economydoes not grow.  Nothing short of sustained economic growth will solve these problems and create opportunity for all Americans.<p>
Economists agree on a few things, but the vast majority agree that we will not grow if we do not save more and invest more.  Tinkering wiht the income tax system is not the answer.  Last year's reforms are reversed the following year.  This year's complexity is made more complex next year.  All the while, no significant improvement is achieved in the U.S. savings rate, and Americans struggle on with a needlessly complex and intrusive tax system.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUTLINE OF THE LUGAR PLAN</h4>
<br>
<br>
A National Sales Tax (NST) on goods and services would replace the federal personal and corporate income taxes.  The capital gains tax and the estate tax would be eliminated as well.<p>
Economists who have studied the national sales tax estimate that the NST rate of about 17% would replace the revenue generated by our current tax system.  The rate would be somewhat higher or lower depending on exemptions, although exemptions should be minimized.<p>
The federal government should work with the states to collect the national sales tax.  The federal government should ensure that it is done without extra cost to the states.  Most states already have sales tax collection systems in place.<p>
Social Security taxes and payment benefits would not be affected by this proposal, except that no
social security benefits would be taxed.<p>
The IRS would be eliminated.  A vastly smaller office or agency would be required to administer the national slaes tax and the FICA tax.  For most Americans, tax record keeping, audits, and filing of forms would be things of the past.<p>
Legislation to implement a national sales tax would have to reflect choices on a number of issues, including the methods used to prevent regressivity.  Any system of taxation requires such decisions.  Like the income tax, a national sales tax can be designed so that it is not regressive.<p>
As increased savings and investment fuels more economic growth, the sales tax should be lowered.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of the National Sales Tax</h3>
An NST will leave more money in American paychecks.  Because the government would no longer withold income taxes from paychecks, citizens would decide how much of their total income to save and how much to subject to taxation through purchases. <p> 
The NST would be a powerful incentive for savings in America.  Currently the United States has one of the lowest savings rates of any industiralized country.  According to a study by economist Laurence Kotlikoff, an NST would increase the savings rate from roughly 2% to about 7.6% in the first year.  Increasing the U.S. savings rate is a key to achieving strong economic growth, lower interests rates, improvements in real wages, and the expansion of revenue necessary to balance the budget.<p>
The national sales tax would allow for the dismantling of the current IRS and the intrusive, inefficient and costly enforcement of the current tax code.  Estimates of uncollected income tax range as hight as $150 billion per year.<p>
Businesses and individuals devote billions of man hours each year to comply with the tax code.  Under an NST, that time could be spent more productively on other activities.<p>
The simplicity of the NST and the absence of the IRS would have the effect of discouraging frequent tinkering with the tax code which complicates business activities, leads to loopholes for special interests, abd creates uncertainties for many Americans.  Thirty-one tax reforms have been enacted in the last 41 years.<p>
The NST, unlike the income tax or a value added tax (VAT), is transparent.  Individuals will know what they are paying to the government in taxes.  A transparent tax would contribute greatly to achieving the national political will to curb spending and balance the budget.<p>
Most states already have mechanisms in place to enforce a sales tax, and most taxpayers already understand how sales taxes work.  Therefore the establishment of a national sales tax could be achieved with a minimum of expense and confusion.<p>
American exports would no longer be put at a competitive disadvantage by the income tax.  Under our current system, the costs of corporate income taxes are built into the price of goods.  This raises the price of exports and make them less competitive overseas.  The NST would helpus export, thereby reducing the trade deficit and creating more jobs.  Economists estimate that for every additional $1 billion in exports, 20,000 jobs are created.  Imports, on the other hand, would be taxed at the time of sale, like all other goods.<p>
Under the NST, drug dealers and other criminals who currently escape or evade the income tax would pay the national sales tax like any other consumer.<p>
Because companies will not have to add the costs of the income tax to their products, the underlying price of most goods and services will be lower under and NST.<p>
An NST would end intrusive enforcement of the tax coe , which harms personal privacy.  It also would eliminate the ambiguity of the income tax, which causes many conscientious Americans to live in anxiety over the possibility of mistakes that could lead to penalties or charges.<p>
Although a flat tax would be a step in the right direction, an NST is preferable because the flat tax would retain many of the complexities of the current income tax system.  The IRS income tax collection aparatus would continue to exist.  Furthermore, the flat tax retains the corporate tax and the complexities involved in its calculation.  Also tinkering with the flat tax would be a constant temptation.  Many would seek to amend the tax code to promote special interests or social agendas.  The history of revisions to the 1986 Tax Reform Act demonstrates that the government  will always be tempted to ament the income tax code.<p>

<title>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar

<center>
<h3>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar<br>
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee<br>
 June 8, 1995</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the area of tax reform.  Your oft quoted comment that our current tax system should be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
What I have found during my travels is that American families are frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament.  They feel like they are running on a treadmill and that treadmill is winning 
The problem is that rnany Americans suspect there is diminishing hope for a better future. 
The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation including both wages and benefits increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage mcrease has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half averaging only 2.4 percent annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must chance. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax stystem that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. After averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recemty saw our nation's savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, our annual productivity gain has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coaltion estimates that had our productivity held its pre 1974 annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $5O,000 a year instead of the current level of  S35,000 a year.<p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide m our spending measures. We must be resolute m this endeavor and not fall victim to buiness as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the American public with tax relief But I strongly believe it is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code We must transform It completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in tbe country. It represents the worst form of big govemment intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs Americans morr than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the tolal worker output of my state of Indiana.  It is unfair.  It is riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work.<p>
By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, worth an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax completely and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
Mr. Chairman, you have outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive (3) fair, (4) border adustable, and (5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax systesm.  But f we are going to overhaul our tax system we should choose the one that meets these criteria.  I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  Under a national sales tax, tbe burden of complying with the income tax would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, mvest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax.  Although I applaud the efforts of  flat tax advocates to simplify tax forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all.<p>
The national sales tax is tbe least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled under ny proposal.  The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every American.  There wil be no audits. Americans would not waste time and effort worrymg about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. Although the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact You have stated, Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back"<p>
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including wealthy individuals, criminals illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes under the national sales tax.  Individual who save and invest their money will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and the deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on reporting will never collect any of this revenue.<p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. An integral part of my plan is protection for Amencans who need it -- senior citzens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying jobs.<p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services
consumed from each American from the national slaes tax.  Each citizen who has a social security number will receive this exemption.  For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have its first $20,0000 exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of four.<p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing and medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one advocated by this committee's chairman.  Americans understand and are comfortable with this practice.  In the end it will be up to this committee and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform proposals. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster effiorts in Congress to achieve prudence m federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or with holding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for federal government to meet its obligations.  If average Americans are paying that rate everyday, they will make sure that Congress spends public funds wisely.<p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of tbe largest trade deficits in our nation's history. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when they are exporting goods. In comparison the  income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not border adjustable.   American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice -- once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination.  In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It would level the playing field with our trading patners.  And best of all foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperitive reason for replacing tbe income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be worse off than the previous one.  Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hop of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are vital because they are
the source of all investment and productivity gains  -- savings supply the capital for buying anew machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, seventy two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent of GDP compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 in the 1980's.<p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future.  Few realize that before WWII, before the income tax reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reeverse this trend by directly taxing consuption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree that a broad based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially.  Economist Laurence Kottlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.  The implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard Universityhas concluded that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place in 1986 instead of the current system, The U.S. would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic rowth.  Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.<p>
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage it enactment.<p>

When July comes to mind one conjures up visions of backyard barbecues, sipping iced-tea on the
front porch, long weekends at the beach, or  Independence Day.  Summer is often thought of as a
less strenuous time, a time when "every night is a Saturday night," a time when Americans can
relax and escape from the burdens of everyday life.  Americans work all year so that in the
summer they may enjoy the fruits of their labor.  However, the reality is that this year the average
American had to work past Independence Day to pay their taxes.  Thus, from New years Eve to
July ninth Americans are working for the government -- that is 190 days out of the year.<p> 

There is little disagreement that our current tax system, in which the average American sends
40% of what they earn to the government, is severely flawed and must change. In describing our
current tax system, Grover G. Norquist, President of Americans For Tax Reform wrote that our
current system, "...favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt
over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.."  Mr. Norquist continues by pronouncing
that: "The current tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:
Once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make
the current tax code much less a barrier to long-term growth just don't get made."  The numbers
back-up Mr. Norquist's claims.  A report on the IRS shows that over the past 10 years some 2000
tax code provisions have been released and the agency has doubled in size.<p> 

 Fortunately, the November elections have brought the tax debate to the forefront of political
discourse for the first time in thirty years.  Today, most politicians agree that the tax code is very
much in need of reform.  However, there is enormous disagreement on how this change should
be orchestrated.  Whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, chances are you have a
plan to reform the tax code.<p>

From House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt who has attempted to bring the Democrats into
the great tax debate with his 10% progressive tax plan to House majority leader Dick Armey who
has spearheaded the tax debate by giving life to what has been dubbed the "Flat Tax," the
leadership of  both parties in the House are responding to the cries of the American people who
are demanding a fairer tax code.  Presidential hopeful Richard Lugar has also joined the debate,
coming out in support of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer's National Sales Tax
proposal.  Whatever the plan may be one thing Washington can certainly agree on, whether for
philosophical or political reasons, is that Americans are demanding a new tax code, one that
allows them to work most of the year for themselves and their families.<p>  

Here are three of the most talked about plans.  Judge for yourself, the merits, (or lack- there-of)
for each, and then go to the Cyber Personality Forum to let people know what you think.  We
promise it won't be too "taxing."<p>
