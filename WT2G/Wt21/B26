<h2>Church Without State</h2>
<b>By John G. West Jr.</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in the United States in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were "forever forming associations." Instead of looking to the government for help, public-spirited citizens sought to solve societal problems on their own. Tocqueville may not have realized that this national enthusiasm for "associations" was largely of recent vintage. Although Americans had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations did not occur until the second decade of the 19th century.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps no one deserves more credit for creating this culture of volunteerism than Lyman Beecher (1775-1863). Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, the elder Beecher was a powerful minister and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues commented, "In massive talent, Lyman Beecher stood among his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate -- alone."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As a young clergyman in the early 1800s, Beecher confronted a society in crisis. Church attendance was dropping, and alcoholism and other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. Elected officials were increasingly reluctant to enforce morality or piety by law, and there was growing support in the political sphere for abolishing tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism in New England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry depended on religion. In the absence of established churches and direct state support for religion, he feared the worst. But instead of despairing, he responded brilliantly: If the government would no longer support religion directly, the religious adherents themselves had to do whatever the government could not. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling people to "support the gospel and attend the public worship of God," Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. "But these means of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians, and by all classes of the community who love their country."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher advocated replacing government support for religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute. In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations would seek to create a political consensus through educational efforts. In a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During his career, Beecher held four pastorates -- in Long Island, New York; Litchfield, Connecticut; Boston; and Cincinnati -- and traveled the Northeast and West speaking not only in churches but also at revival and reform meetings. His widely circulated sermons and tracts helped inspire evangelicals to organize scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and social and political reform. They formed groups to help alleviate poverty, teach reading and writing to the poor, and prevent alcohol abuse. Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of the Sabbath. The many private associations of the era transformed American society in a way that few government programs could.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"They say ministers have lost their influence," Beecher wrote years later. "The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence than ever they could" have with state support. He had learned through experience that the free-enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish. Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state as beneficial to true religion. But at the time, they tended to view religion as a private matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher's unique contribution was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once direct state support of churches had ended.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even as Beecher championed Christianity's civic role, however, he keenly appreciated the limits of religious activism and recognized the dangers that politicking posed for Christianity. The political ambitions of some activists could easily overwhelm the message of the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher advised Christians to confine their political efforts to the "great questions of national morality" and avoid formulating an explicitly Christian position on every political issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During our own era, when questions are again being raised about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might learn from Beecher's free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion in public life.

<h2>In the Trenches of A City's War on Poverty</h2>
<b>by Kim A. Lawton</b>
<p><p><P></center>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For Marcia, release from a California prison was 
both a blessing and a curse: She suddenly had to figure out how to care for herself and her infant 
son. An abuser of heroin and cocaine for more than 20 years, she had few job skills or prospects. 
She had been on welfare, but balked at returning to that treadmill. And if she checked into a drug 
treatment program, she probably would be separated from her baby. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I knew that I was going to begin using [drugs] again . . 
. and I knew that I didn't want to do that," says Marcia, who asked not to be fully identified. "I 
just was tired of it all." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then she heard about House of Grace, a residential 
program in San Jose for abused, homeless, or addicted women. It is one of the few recovery 
programs in the county that allows mothers to stay with their children. As soon as Marcia and her 
son moved into the program's renovated apartment complex in December 1994, house director 
Denise Lutcher got actively involved in her life. Lutcher and her staff went to work assessing 
Marcia's physical, emotional, vocational, and spiritual needs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For residents like Marcia, that list of needs is 
usually long. Women receive counseling, attend recovery classes, complete their education, and 
learn life skills such as managing a budget and caring for their children. But they must also 
follow a clear set of rules. They must wean themselves from welfare and other government aid 
within six months. They are permitted no televisions or telephones in their rooms. A resident 
who fails her weekly drug test just once faces immediate expulsion. And the women must attend 
Bible classes and chapel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The program helped me to get a hold of my life 
because of the tools they teach," says Marcia. Today, at 42, she is entering the final phases of her 
recovery program at the House of Grace. She has enrolled in a local college, where she is earning 
top grades in a program on computing and information systems. She holds a part-time job. Her 
son, now two, is flourishing in a community with other stable parents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	House of Grace typifies the strategy -- and the 
success -- of a community-based and religiously rooted approach to helping the urban poor. It is 
one of several programs set up by CityTeam Ministries, a private, nondenominational Christian 
agency working in the inner city of San Jose. Last year, CityTeam administered a budget of $7 
million and a staff of nearly a hundred, and provided intensive, on-going help to more than 5,000 
individuals and families -- all without a dollar of public funds. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As noted in a recent Hudson Institute report, the 
agency has transformed itself to meet the changing social needs of San Jose. As the city grew 
from a small industrial town in the 1950s to a world technology capital, it drew thousands of 
poor Anglo, Vietnamese, and Latino families, out-of-work laborers, gangs, and crack addicts. 
Meanwhile, CityTeam evolved from a homeless shelter for white, middle-aged alcoholic men 
into a comprehensive program for homeless and drug-addicted women, children at risk, and 
entire families living in or on the edge of poverty. And it has done so by mobilizing an army of 
volunteers and donors, energizing a committed and innovative staff, and applying an intensive, 
holistic approach to solving problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each of CityTeam's programs combines a 
philosophy of compassionate intervention mixed with strict accountability, an emphasis on long-
term changes in destructive behavioral patterns, and a strong religious underpinning. The Bible is 
the main guide both to morality and to practical living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While some state agencies were devoting a lot of 
time and money to providing the homeless with food and housing, CityTeam began to focus on 
drug and alcohol addiction -- which it considers the root causes of most homelessness -- and in 
1983 established a residential recovery program. While most state-funded recovery programs last 
about 30 days, CityTeam staff believe more time is needed for permanent changes; participants 
remain in recovery programs for between 18 and 24 months. And while government-supported 
rehabilitation programs demand that staff members have degrees in social work, the rescue 
mission's house manager is himself a former crack addict and a graduate of the group's recovery 
and Christian training programs; he's now completing his master's degree.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Field workers realized that preventing addiction 
meant reaching children before they began using drugs. From this insight emerged a youth 
program that includes Camp May-Mac, a summer camp for at-risk inner-city children. 
Throughout the year, CityTeam keeps about a thousand kids busy with regular recreational 
activities, neighborhood clubs, tutoring, leadership development, and Bible studies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here their approach is unconventional: The 
group's youth workers actually move into the troubled neighborhoods of east San Jose in order to 
build stable relationships with children at risk. CityTeam President Pat Robertson says kids know 
where the organization's workers live and know that they can reach those workers anytime, day 
or night. "[We] are not just commuting in and out," he says. "The problems of the community are 
our problems."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Whole families are helped through the agency's 
family-relief center, where counselors distinguish urgent and immediate needs from long-term, 
underlying issues. Volunteers distribute food, clothing, and furniture, provide rent assistance, 
assemble holiday food boxes and kits of school supplies, and teach English as a second-language 
to Spanish and Vietnamese residents. Volunteers also act as unofficial caseworkers, following up 
with client families. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Harry Brown, the vice president for administration, 
says CityTeam's extensive volunteer network enables the agency to provide a level of support 
and personal help that rivals publicly funded programs in the city. CityTeam volunteers -- about 
3,000 in any year -- are involved in everything from baby-sitting to tutoring to prayer. Most 
volunteers are recruited through local churches or ads. While some volunteers work only once a 
year, others offer a regular commitment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CityTeam applies the same targeted grass-roots 
approach to fundraising as it does to delivering social services. Most staff members spend up to 
eight hours a week fundraising, providing the agency with about 40,000 active donors -- an 
impressive base for a local charity -- with average contributions of less than $200. "It's Joe and 
Sally Smith at 50 bucks a month who sustain our organization," says Brown. "It's possible 
because there are a large number of stakeholders who believe in the goal and are willing to 
participate in the process."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to a 1995 study by Independent Sector, 
an umbrella group for nongovernmental organizations, most private charities rely heavily on 
direct government subsidies. But Robertson says that because of CityTeam's strong religious 
emphasis, the ministry consistently refuses to accept any government aid, which imposes rules 
against proselytizing clients and discriminating among job applicants. At CityTeam, all staff 
members must share the agency's evangelical Christian beliefs; most programs require 
mandatory chapel attendance or Bible studies and encourage involvement in local churches. "We 
focus on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and how that influences life on a practical 
level," says Curt Floski, the director of the Rescue Mission and Recovery Program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Staff members say the religious component, with its 
emphasis on personal transformation, is indispensable. An internal 1992 study seems to 
corroborate that: Of the men who had graduated from CityTeam's addiction-recovery program 
between 1986 and 1992, more than 60 percent were still "working and clean and sober." National 
experts have found that among low-income and low-education groups -- the agency's principal 
client population -- recovery success rates typically remain below 16 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Can the CityTeam approach be duplicated in other 
urban areas? The group launched a branch outside Philadelphia in the mid-1980s, and it has 
earned high marks from community leaders. "They have done more to end human suffering in 
Chester [Pennsylvania] than any other organization I know of," says Jack Holefelder, the 
president of the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In San Jose, CityTeam has established the 
International Center for Urban Training. Through seminars, instructional manuals, and work in 
agency projects, trainees learn about the group's holistic service philosophy. The staff also teach 
techniques for fundraising, volunteer recruitment, strategic planning, public affairs, and 
government relations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Officials say they are committed to developing 
models of ministry that can be broadly replicated to help the poor. "One of the things you find is 
that needs out there are relatively common, and the solutions that apply to them also have 
relatively common applications," Brown says. "You have to have a set of core values [relevant] 
to the issues, and then you have to consistently implement those values." And the vital dynamic, 
Robertson says, is personal involvement and intervention: "Programs are best done at the local 
level when you can look people eyeball to eyeball." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who challenged Marcia to change made 
a crucial difference in her life. For the first time, she says, she learned that she possessed both 
abilities and responsibilities -- and that it was time to offer them to her family and community. 
Now she spends her evenings teaching "life skills" seminars to other women living at the House 
of Grace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marcia learned it was possible to walk away from a 
life of addiction, and she has remained drug free. And most importantly, she says, she acquired a 
spiritual foundation for her life. "It's everything that I needed," she says, "things that I lacked for 
so long, or that I was too medicated to even realize were missing."

<h2>Our Foundering Fathers</h2>
<P>
<B>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</B> 
<P>
<B>Are You a Sperm Dad?</B> 
<P>
Perhaps the most important book written this decade on our greatest
social crisis is <I>Fatherless America: Confronting Our Most Urgent
Social Problem</I>, by New York intellectual David Blankenhorn.
The president of the Institute of American Values, Blankenhorn
dissects the insidious and prevalent bias against the value of
fatherhood in both elite and popular culture. In this impassioned
yet carefully reasoned and researched book, he argues that being
a father is &quot;society's most important role for men.&quot;
<P>
While mothers typically concentrate on meeting children's immediate
physical and emotional needs, Blankenhorn writes, fathers tend
to &quot;focus on preparation for the future and on children's
success in the larger society. Fathers are likely to devote special
attention to character traits necessary for the future, especially
qualities such as independence, self-reliance, and the willingness
to test limits and take risks.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, Blankenhorn writes, a proper view of fatherhood is essential
to the concept of masculinity. &quot;Fatherhood cannot destroy
or oppose masculinity, but fatherhood must domesticate masculinity.
In a good society, men prove their manhood by being good fathers.&quot;
But many journalists, academics, and purveyors of popular culture
are writing a new &quot;cultural script&quot;-new definitions
of what it means to be a man-that fails to serve the needs of
children, families, or society. Here are some of the inadequate
roles available to today's dads:
<P>
The Unnecessary Father. &quot;He may be useful in some ways. He
may be a nice guy, perhaps even a force for good. But he is nonessential,
peripheral, 'not that important.' His presence may be appreciated,
but it is not required.&quot;
<P>
The Visiting Father. This poor chump writes the checks and strives
valiantly to stay in touch with his children after a divorce.
Although often romanticized, as in the popular <I>movie Mrs. Doubtfire</I>,
&quot;the great majority of visiting fathers are not-indeed, cannot
be-good-enough fathers to their children,&quot; Blankenhorn writes.
<P>
The Sperm Father. He accounts for nearly 30 percent of all fathers
of young children. &quot;His is the fatherhood of the one-night
stand, the favor for a friend, the donation or sale of sperm.
His child is the unintended consequence, the result of the affair
that did not work out, the reason for the paternity suit, the
baby he never learned about.&quot;
<P>
The Stepfather and the Nearby Guy. Rosy assumptions to the contrary,
&quot;children who live with stepfathers experience outcomes that
are no better, and frequently worse, than children in mother-only
homes.&quot; The Nearby Guy (a coach, a teacher, the mother's
boyfriend) provides not fathering but often &quot;ambiguity, complexity,
and frequent change.&quot;
<P>
The New Father. &quot;He expresses his emotions. He is a healer,
a companion, a colleague, He is a deeply involved parent. He changes
diapers, gets up at 2 a.m. to feed the baby, goes beyond 'helping
out' in order to share equally in the work, joys, and responsibilities
of domestic life.&quot; How can you hate this guy? Blankenhorn
doesn't fault dads who change diapers, but he insists that this
is not their most important contribution.
<P>
In contrast to this cast of losers, Blankenhorn holds up the Good
Family Man. He &quot;puts his family first. He is responsible
for them. He sacrifices for them&quot; to help prepare them for
life in the real world. Sure, this guy also helps his wife care
for the children and pitches in with household duties, but he
views his role as complementary, not identical, to that of his
spouse. This distinction is vital to the masculinity of men and
to the future of fatherhood.
<P>
That's why, Blankenhorn says, it is crucial that society provide
men with the right cultural script, because successful fathering
depends more on societal codes of conduct than on biology. If
we get those codes wrong, we'll see &quot;the continuing decline
of fatherhood and a deepening ambivalence and skepticism toward
masculinity.&quot; We must get them right, because &quot;fatherhood,
more than any other male activity, helps men to become good men.&quot;
<P>
<B>Your Man-Frog or Prince?</B> 
<P>
If you want to be a good father, the single most important thing
you can do is to be a good husband. In a landmark study of marriage
and parenting styles, Jay Belsky, professor in the Department
of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State
University, has found that men whose marriages were in decline
tended to exhibit parenting traits that undermine child development.
<P>
&quot;Men appear much less likely than women to distinguish between
their feelings about their child and their feelings about the
marriage,&quot; writes Belsky in <I>The Transition to Parenthood:
How a First Child Changes a Marriage; Why Some Couples Grow Closer
and Others Apart</I>. (The book, by Belsky and John Kelly, is
available in paperback from Dell.) &quot;If a man is dissatisfied
with the latter, he will usually stay away from his family, even
if it means sacrificing the opportunity to get to know and form
a close bond with his youngster.&quot;
<P>
Sadly, it seems marriages tend to be most vulnerable just when
they need to be strongest-when children are very young. Belsky
found that when children entered the picture, a little over half
of all marriages declined. Only 20 percent of couples thought
their marriages improved, and the remaining 30 percent of couples
found their level of marital satisfaction to be about the same.
Research by the National Center for Fathering also shows a &quot;U-pattern&quot;
of marital satisfaction. It is high before the birth of the first
child, declines when children are young, and tends to rise again
as the children grow older and leave home.
<P>
Belsky writes that a major area of marital discord is the division
of responsibility for child care and housekeeping. Babies are
a lot of work, and the mother generally finds she bears most of
the burden-by choice or by default. Because a woman will tend
to measure her husband's share in domestic duties against her
own (she typically does three times more than he does), that perception
of unfairness breeds resentment. But men measure their contribution
(which averages 15 or 16 hours a week) against what their fathers
did. By this yardstick, husbands today are doing 40 percent more
household work than men did a generation before. Also, she tends
to downplay his contributions as a breadwinner; he regards them
more highly. By his calculations, he's a prince; by hers, he's
a frog.
<P>
The arrival of children provokes spousal conflict in other areas
as well, Belsky writes, including money, work, social life, and
commitment to the relationship. Obviously, those who would counsel
couples in their transition to parenthood must urge them to address
unrealistic expectations and conflict over gender roles. Discouraging
divorce is not enough; we must foster strong and loving marriages
that nurture the healthy development of children.

<h2>Leading the Fatherhood Brigade</h2>
<P>
Thousands of men gather in football stadiums around the country
to recommit themselves to their wives and children. Vice President
Albert Gore attends a national summit on fatherhood, with major
news media in tow, and chastises men for walking away from &quot;the
most important role that any of us will ever play in life.&quot;
Hundreds of thousands of African-American men convene in Washington,
D.C., to pledge responsibility to their families. Is fatherhood
making a comeback in the nation with the world's highest rate
of father absence? &quot;There's not a movement,&quot; says The
Reverend Donald Burwell of Fathers' Education Network in Detroit.
&quot;But I do think there is a fatherhood revival or Renaissance.&quot;
Whatever we call it, something is going on. In recent years, several
new groups dedicated to promoting fatherhood have sprouted, and
older organizations have reoriented their efforts to this cause.
Here are some of the leaders in the fatherhood field-a mix of
liberal and conservative, religious and secular-all united in
a belief that fathers are vital to their children's well-being.

 &quot;What reduces crime, child poverty, and teen pregnancy,
and requires no new taxes?&quot; asks the National Fatherhood
Initiative. The group's answer, of course, is good fathers. The
nonprofit organization was founded in 1993 to spread the &quot;news&quot;
that fathers are indispensable to their children's development.
<P>
Its goal is ambitious: broad cultural and social change. But it
has widespread support, savvy, creative and committed leadership,
and a national advisory board that includes William J. Bennett,
James Earl Jones, congressman Steve Largent, Willard Scott, Louis
Sullivan, and George Gallup. NFI's aggressive media outreach has
garnered more than 650 mentions in publications nationwide. With
backing from the Advertising Council, NFI will launch a blitz
public-service announcements this year to reintroduce fatherhood
as a vital concept.
<P>
NFI has become a nerve center for various fatherhood groups, sponsoring
national and local meetings. Last summer and fall, NFI chairman
David Blankenhorn led a &quot;National Fatherhood Tour&quot; to
30 cities to meet with community activists and promote the NFI
&quot;fatherhood pledge.&quot;
<P>
The organization plans an interfaith summit in Washington, D.C.,
in May, to convene various religious leaders-a more modest version
of its 1994 National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, which brought
together national and local religious, civic, business, and entertainment
leaders. Also in the works is a summit addressing the needs of
the African-American community, to be chaired by Louis Sullivan,
the secratary of health and human services under President George
Bush.
<P>
NFI president Don Eberly, a former top aide to Jack Kemp, is based
in the national office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, while director
Wade Horn, a former U.S. Commissioner of Children, Youth, and
Families, works out of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Originally conceived
as a public-education campaign, NFI has also become a membership
organization in response to popular demand. Membership benefits
include a quarterly newsletter, a media kit, a guide for community
activists, and a catalog of fatherhood-related books and videos.
With three full-time and three part-time staff members and a budget
of about $600,000, the institute's challenge now is to find the
funding to carry out its many ambitious initiatives.

Considered one of the leaders in the field, the National Center
for Fathering is a Kansas-based nonprofit organization that trains
individuals in the fundamentals of fatherhood. Founded in 1990
by scholar Ken Canfield, the center holds seminars based on Canfield's
<I>The Seven Secrets of Effective Fathers</I> (available from
NCF in paperback and as an audiocassette or a video seminar).&quot;Where
National Fatherhood Initiative is the strategic bomber of the
fatherhood movement, we are the infantrymen in the trenches,&quot;
says NCF spokesman David Warnick. With a budget of $560,000 and
10 full-time staff members, NCF runs programs for fathers from
all backgrounds, including corporate personnel, prisoners, military
dads, and inner-city fathers, and is actively involved in minority
outreach. More than 15,000 fathers around the country have participated
in its two-day training sessions.
<P>
Its national training program, &quot;Operation Domestic Shield,&quot;
is often disseminated through church networks, and Canfield works
as a trainer for the evangelical Christian group Promise Keepers.
But NCF prides itself on being a nonpartisan, nonsectarian organization,
working with everyone from California governor Pete Wilson to
Vice-President Al Gore.
<P>
The National Center for Fathering publishes a quarterly magazine,
<I>Today's Father: For Men Who Want To Be Better Dads</I>, which
contains parenting advice and lists of books and other resources,
and also produces a three-minute radio program carried on more
than 300 stations nationwide.

Although technically not a &quot;father&quot; group, this Christian
evangelical organization, founded by former University of Colorado
head football coach Bill McCartney, keeps popping up on the lists
of leaders in the fatherhood-renewal movement because it promotes
the building of strong marriages and families. It has been drawing
tens of thousands of men, for $55 a ticket, into sports arenas
from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C., for two-day conferences
featuring Christian music and inspirational speakers. Men make
a series of promises to God, wife, family, friendships, church,
and community.
<P>
Headed by president Randy Phillips, Promise Keepers now has a
staff of 250 and a budget of $64 million, and its 1-800 number
averages 20,000 calls a day during its summer registration season.
Such success has alarmed some women's groups. In October 1995,
for instance, a <I>Glamour</I> magazine editorial referred to
Promise Keepers as &quot;among those who still think men can't
keep up unless women are kept down.&quot; In response, the group
contends that being a leader means being a servant to one's family,
not a tyrant.

On Father's Day last year, Vice President Al Gore announced a
new nongovernmental initiative to promote paternal involvement
through community-based mentoring programs. The goals and structure
of Father to Father are so ill-defined that it is difficult to
tell where this initiative is going, but Gore's high-profile support
will bring welcome attention to the issue. This loose federation,
under the direction of Martha Farrell Erickson of the Children,
Youth and Family Consortium at the University of Minnesota, offers
kits to communities and organizations that want to reach out to
fathers, providing lists of resources and strategies for starting
their own mentoring group.

Under the mantle of the liberal Families and Work Institute since
1989, the Fatherhood Project was founded in 1981 by director James
A. Levine as a national research and education program to increase
male involvement in childrearing.
<P>
Programs include the Male Involvement Project, directed by Edward
W. Pitt, which works with Head Start and other early childhood
and family support programs. The MIP sponsors community-based
social programs in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco
Bay area, and a national training program for early-childhood
administrators such as pre-school directors. Publications include
<I>Getting Men Involved: Strategies for Early Childhood Programs</I>
and <I>New Expectations: Community Strategies for Responsible
Fatherhood</I>. The Fatherhood Project also oversees a program
called Fathers and Work, which promotes family-friendly workplaces
and presents seminars on how to deal with &quot;daddy stress.&quot;
<P>
A caveat: Critics argue that the project's emphasis on separating
men from the role of breadwinner could inadvertently erode paternal
involvement and provision. Some claim that directors Levine and
Pitt have bought into a feminist agenda that aims to turn fathers
into substitute moms.

Hailed as a &quot;modern-day prophet&quot; and a &quot;visionary&quot;
by others in fatherhood circles, Charles Augustus Ballard began
the institute 13 years ago to help young, directionless black
men in Cleveland, Ohio, become involved in their children's lives.
(See his article, &quot;Prodigal Dad: How We Bring Fathers Home
to Their Children,&quot; in the Winter 1995 <I>Policy Review</I>.)
Most fathers who have gone through Ballard's program finish high
school, get jobs, and legally establish their paternity.
<P>
Ballard's emphasis on reuniting fathers with their children--grounded
in thoroughly biblical themes of family and responsibility-has
appeal across the political spectrum. The institute's national
office is housed in the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a nonpartisan liberal think tank. His urban program got
a tremendous boost in early 1995 when the Ford Foundation gave
the group $2 million to reproduce its efforts nationally. The
institute has opened five new centers: in Milwaukee, Washington,
D.C., San Diego, Atlanta, and Yonkers, N.Y., each to be headed
by a married couple. The institute's strategy is to saturate one
blighted neighborhood at a time.
<P>
Some question whether a group headed by a single charismatic leader
can replicate and institutionalize its programs. We'll see: Each
new location will be headed by men and women who have been trained
by Ballard in Cleveland.

Six years ago, 18 African-American men in Omaha, Nebraska, decided
they would no longer tolerate gang violence and drug-dealing in
their neighborhoods. So they created M.A.D. D.A.D.S. (Men Against
Destruction-Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder), a community-based
group that organizes street patrols, paints over gang graffiti,
confronts drug-dealers and gang members, sponsors activities for
youth such as block parties and car shows, and to counsels young
people in local jails.
<P>
&quot;We started out of pain-the pain of our children dying in
the streets of their own communities,&quot; says a recent M.A.D.
D.A.D.S. publication. &quot;We realized that we could hold no
one responsible but ourselves. . . . So we united as a handful
of community fathers who now know that we must be the force behind
change.&quot;
<P>
From this handful grew an organization of more than 25,000 volunteers,
with 41 chapters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.
<P>
The group has logged more than 87,000 volunteer hours on the streets-more
than half after midnight. For its work on the front lines of impoverished
minority communities, M.A.D. D.A.D.S. has won national recognition
from Presidents Bush and Clinton, the National Education Association,
and <I>Essence</I> magazine. Fathers who want to open a chapter
of M.A.D. D.A.D.S. in their community can contact the national
office in Omaha and ask for John Foster, Bishop Robert Tyler,
or Eddie Staton.

Can ex-cons be good dads? The Reverend Donald Burwell, whose organization
works with fathers newly returned from prison or first-time offenders
hoping to avoid jail time, has answered that question at least
5,000 times. Since 1990, that's how many men his Detroit-based
group has trained in the interpersonal skills they need to reconnect
with their families. In the process, the organization has cut
recidivism rates in half for its participants. FEN also offers
instruction to women to help them reinforce at home what their
husbands or boyfriends have learned in class.
<P>
A tax-exempt nonprofit funded solely by donations, FEN will soon
be taking Burwell's innovative curriculum to four new locations
in Michigan, and opening branches in Chicago, Brownsville, Texas,
and near Memphis, Tennessee.

</CENTER>
<P>
	States across the country are trying to reduce welfare costs and attack the system's culture of 
subsidized family breakdown. They're capping benefits for additional children born into welfare 
families, booting childless recipients from the rolls, and setting time limits on assistance. One of 
the nation's most provocative experiments aims to reform not only welfare but the individuals 
who receive it -- by turning over the state's role as social worker to local churches and 
synagogues.
<p>
	"God, not government, will be the savior of welfare recipients," says Mississippi governor 
Kirk Fordice. The Republican governor is convinced that the religious community can succeed 
where government by itself cannot -- by transforming the attitudes and behaviors of the welfare 
class. What is emerging in Mississippi is an unprecedented alliance between the governor, the 
state's Department of Human Services (DHS), and scores of local churches_all determined to 
tap the moral and spiritual resources of congregations to help lift Mississippi's 167,000 welfare 
recipients into permanent economic independence.
<p>
	Mississippi appears ripe for such an experiment. It is at once one of the nation's poorest states 
and one of its most religious. There are more churches here per capita than in any other state, but 
it also has the largest percentage of citizens receiving welfare assistance. Here many children still 
begin their school days in prayer, but more and more of those same children are having babies, 
pushing the state's illegitimacy rate to 44 percent. Here the cab drivers listen to Christian radio 
but navigate in cities where more than half of all children now live with an unmarried mother.
<p>
	A Gallup poll reveals that Mississippi and its southern neighbors boast "the greatest 
concentration and highest levels of religious fervor in America." So why hasn't all of this 
religiosity translated into stronger families, fewer people dependent on government welfare, and 
fewer social problems?
<p>
	It is perhaps ironic that a politician, not a preacher, has moved that question near the center of 
welfare reform in Mississippi. A year ago, Fordice summoned the state's religious leaders to the 
capitol, where he more or less read them the riot act. He challenged them to reach out 
aggressively to needy families in their communities, but to stop repeating the errors of 
government assistance. "The present system does absolutely nothing to inspire self-esteem, 
independence, or healthy family relationships," he has said.
<p>
	The "Faith and Families Project" hopes to revolutionize that system by matching welfare 
families, typically headed by an unmarried mother with at least two children, with congregations 
ready to become their <i>de facto</i> social workers. DHS officials expect participating 
churches to help individuals find good jobs and keep them. That means getting personally 
involved in ways that most state caseworkers, each tracking more than 200 families, cannot: 
lending emotional support and helping with child care, household budgeting, even grocery 
shopping.
<p>
	So far, the state has struck an arrangement that is keeping church-state litigators quiet. 
Churches are not asked to provide any financial support to welfare recipients; families are not 
required to attend the churches providing help. No welfare benefits are funneled through 
congregations, but government assistance, averaging $858 a month per family, continues until 
the family is independent.
<p>
	State officials expect, however, that congregations will do what they dare not try: wield moral 
authority and spiritual values among the state's 50,000 AFDC families -- one by one -- to 
transform their culture of dependency. "The problem is not material poverty, it is behavioral 
poverty," says Donald Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi DHS. "We're not interested 
in getting churches to replace welfare. What we're asking them is, `what can you provide to help 
move a family from economic slavery to economic independence?' "
<p>
	The answers are becoming increasingly urgent as Congress converts the federal welfare 
system into block grants, shifting primary responsibility for the poor back to the state and local 
level. Mississippi's tough welfare-to-workfare program, buoyed by rapid job growth, has helped 
reduce AFDC rolls by 12,000 families over the last three years. But state and federal welfare 
costs, including Medicaid, food stamps and supplemental security income, hit $2.3 billion in 
Mississippi in 1993, or at least $16,870 per family in poverty. Moreover, no state has a higher 
portion of its welfare expenses -- about 80 percent -- paid by the federal government than 
Mississippi.
<p>
	By maintaining the state's safety net but focusing on permanent behavioral change, Fordice 
hopes to reduce generational poverty. The goal: to see each of the state's 5,000 congregations 
adopt a welfare family, or about 10 percent of the existing caseload. Fordice hopes to bring down 
the number of long-term dependents, keep newly independent families from slipping back into 
poverty, and help families at risk -- hopefully making large new state expenditures on welfare 
unnecessary.
<p>
	Will it work?
<p>
	Beatrice Branch, Mississippi director of the NAACP, expects "minimal" results, claiming the 
plan "does not have broad-based support." Rims Barber, an ACLU lobbyist in Jackson, calls the 
program an election-year ploy, "a strong PR campaign, but that's all." 
<p>
	Try telling that to the Rev. Ronald Moore, the pastor of Stronger Hope Church in north 
Jackson. Moved by the governor's vision to enlist the aid of local churches, Moore began to 
challenge his black, middle-class congregation to reach out to welfare families in the city's 
depressed central and south sections. His congregation of about 200 has adopted 17 families, and 
five have found full-time employment. "I think the governor has hit a grand slam," says Moore. 
"He has caused many church leaders to say `yes, we've dispensed love, but there is a group of 
people who we've not really changed.' "
<p>
	Much of the state's religious community -- dominated mainly by independent-minded Baptist 
churches and black congregations with memories of racial segregation -- remains skeptical about 
any partnership with government. Nevertheless, about 175 churches have contacted the DHS to 
get profiles of welfare families in their neighborhoods, and have adopted more than 75 families 
on AFDC. In September, the Mississippi Family Council hosted a conference on breaking the 
welfare cycle that drew more than 200 church leaders and lay people.
<p>
	 The most common refrain was that churches -- black and white -- are indeed failing in their 
most basic moral and spiritual responsibilities to the poor.
<p>
	"There is something wrong with a gospel that will not lead people out of poverty," says the 
Rev. Thomas Jenkins, chairman of the church-based New Lake Development Foundation in 
central Jackson. The foundation offers tutoring programs and classes for the General Equivalency 
Degree, carpentry, computer training, and transitional housing for women and children -- all 
emphasizing the implications of faith on daily decision-making.
<p>
	Moore, who recruits congregations statewide for the program, emphasizes the role of the 
church in teaching personal responsibility and hard work, sexual abstinence and fatherhood. His 
favorite theme: "Stop doing what the government's been doing. Government has been trying to 
treat the effect, the aftermath. But we've got to go back to the basics and treat the cause." 
<p>
	Over the last year, Moore has addressed more than 300 pastors representing several 
denominations. Numerous churches have endorsed the initiative, including the National Baptist 
Convention, the nation's largest black denomination.
<p>
	Top DHS officials, handpicked by Governor Fordice, are reading from the same reform 
hymnal. Executive director Taylor has invited a leading consulting firm to work with his deputies 
and divisional directors to remake the agency's philosophy of assistance. State caseworkers who 
continue to function as "enablers," Taylor says, are in for a rude awakening. 
<p>
	The buzzwords at the DHS now are "accountability," "responsibility," and "permanent 
change." That's a significant leap for any state welfare department. And if large numbers of the 
state's congregations take up the governor's challenge to labor among the poor, then Mississippi 
could redefine the welfare debate with other words -- such as faith, hope, and charity.

<h2>Graham Cracks the Racial Barrier</h2>
<p>
	Mississippi governors haven't always had such cordial relations with religious leaders. In 
1952, a fiery young Southern Baptist preacher named Billy Graham led an interracial crusade in 
Jackson, defying segregationist governor Hugh White's request that he hold entirely separate 
services for blacks.
<p>
	Graham wrestled with the segregation question just as he was beginning to attain national 
prominence as an evangelical preacher. Though he rejected separate services during his Jackson 
campaign, Graham accepted segregated seating. He seemed to have done so with reservations. 
Toward the close of the crusade, he said that God's love knows no racial barriers. Moreover, he 
identified Jackson's two greatest social problems as illegal liquor (Mississippi was still dry) and 
segregation.
<p>
	"There is no scriptural basis for segregation. It may be there are places where such is desirable 
to both races, but certainly not in the church," Graham told the crowd. "The ground at the foot of 
the cross is level. . . . [I]t touches my heart when I see whites stand shoulder to shoulder with 
blacks at the cross."
<p>
	Though Graham's statements were both risky and visionary -- he made them four years before 
Martin Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence -- he waffled on the segregation question 
when challenged by critics. He must have done some soul-searching over the next several 
months: In March 1953, a year before the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools, Graham 
told the sponsoring committee of his Chattanooga, Tennessee, crusade that he could not abide 
segregated seating. The committee balked. Graham didn't blink: Committee members watched in 
astonishment as he personally took down the ropes separating black and white sections.
<p>
	After the Court's <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ruling, Graham never permitted any 
form of enforced segregation in his meetings, even in the Deep South.
<p.
	"The church should have been the pacesetter. The church should voluntarily be doing what the 
federal courts are doing by pressure and compulsion," the young preacher said. Graham soon 
became convinced -- as even many secularists now claim -- that "a great spiritual revival is 
needed to relieve the racial and political tensions of today."

<p>
Buried deep within one of the many articles that sought to account for the tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain last year was a most surprising revelation. According to Village Voice writer Sarah Ferguson, the grunge-rock pioneer's favorite television shows included Leave It to Beaver and Mayberry, R.F.D.<p>
That a cutting-edge cultural icon married to alternative rock's premier feminist (Courtney Love, of the band Hole) could have such retrograde, politically incorrect viewing tastes was, in Ferguson's mind, "odd." But it was also revealing. Grunge rock "is music for kids who grew up too fast," Ferguson says. "It engages in a kind of mournful nostalgia for a childhood without violation." <p>
Cobain was certainly no stranger to violation. Every significant examination of his life regards the divorce of his parents as a major turning point. In fact, so painful were Cobain's memories of the divorce that he once held a gun to his head and told his wife, "I'd rather die than divorce."<p>
Clearly, one does not have to regard Mayberry as nirvana in order to believe that Cobain and many members of his generation would have fared far better if they had grown up in something resembling Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. Yet, few people todayeven conservativesare prepared to confront the problem that first sent Cobain's young life reeling. Indeed, when Dan Quayle returned last year to the San Francisco club where he gave his famous 1992 Murphy Brown speech, he was quick to point out that when he spoke of the problems surrounding single-parent families, he wasn't referring to "households where the father has died, or even where he is separated by divorce." Rather, Quayle said, he was referring to "those households that have never known a father."<p>
Now, in fairness to Quayle, he also noted that "the ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family." Nevertheless, by suggesting that divorce has more in common with death (which is almost always involuntary) than with illegitimacy (almost always voluntary), Quayle's remarks contribute to the trivialization of divorce at a time when social scientists are increasingly likely to agree that the impact of divorce on children is almost always negative and often devastating.<p>
Indeed, as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead argued in her celebrated article on family break-up in the Atlantic Monthly, divorcelike illegitimacyis strongly linked to a wide variety of negative outcomes for children, from child abuse and neglect to serious juvenile crime. A 1994 study of juveniles in the Wisconsin correction system found that 1 in 3 came from divorced or separated homes. Several studies show that unmarried girls whose parents divorce are much more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant out of wedlock than girls from intact households. A 1994 study by researchers at Duke and North Carolina State University reported that family dissolution is a stronger predictor of suicide for young males than such factors as unemployment.<p>
Despite the clear impact of family break-up on children, "some people aren't comfortable talking about divorce and adultery," former Education Secretary William Bennett told a Christian Coalition conference last year. "But it seems to me we have to talk about them. They are before us, and they have great consequences."<p>
Great indeed. The number of children directly affected by divorce has more than doubled in a generation, from 463,000 in 1960 to 985,000 in 1991. Until political and cultural leaders give proper attention to the link between divorce and many of our nation's most serious social problemscrime, poverty, educational declinewe stand little chance of reversing these trends. <p> <b><center>Too Close to Home</b></center>
<p>
One of the obvious reasons there is less public handwringing about divorce than illegitimacy is because divorce hits closer to home in middle America. As Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute recently observed, "Whereas illegitimacy happens mostly among people who live on the other side of the tracks, much divorce and separation takes place in 'our' own neighborhoods, indeed among our friends and relations, and sometimes even ourselves." Divorce is subject to the phenomenon Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "defining deviancy down," in which a society loses its capacity to define certain problems as problems because of their sheer prevalence. Illegitimacy, conversely, continues to be viewed as "deviant" because it is still fairly rare among the middle and upper classes.<p>
It is frequently asserted that half of all marriages end in divorce. The number, derived by comparing the annual number of marriages to the annual number of divorces, overstates the likelihood of a failed first marriage.  This is because the number is skewed upward by the experience of men and women who have gone through divorce many times. The truth is that about one quarter of all adults who have ever been married in America today have also experienced divorce.<p>
Still, divorce is common enough that to raise concerns about it publicly is to risk being impolitic. As Bennett puts it, "The rules are broken down. If you leave your wife and get yourself a 'trophy wife,' you're not going to be greeted with condemnation or even a raised eye by most people, because it has become a convention."<p>
Not only has this convention stifled debate, but it has helped create an expectation of marital failure that can be seen throughout our culture. A recent cartoon in a major publication depicted one young adult saying to another, "It's only marriage I'm proposing after all, not a lifetime commitment." Similarly, in a recent Newsweek story on divorce, one young woman explained why she limited the guest list at her wedding to 70 people, less than one third the size of her sister's wedding list: "I was afraid to make that much of an investment," she said. "What if it didn't work out? Then, I'd have to tell all those people." <p>
Such apprehensions about marriage are especially common among those whose parents have split up. A study by Pamela Webster, a sociologist at Brown University, found that adults whose parents had divorced rated their own chances of divorcing to be considerably higher than did adults whose parents had not divorced. This finding held up even when comparing groups of couples who rated their marital happiness equally. <p>
Sadly, expectations of marital failure have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologist Silvio Silvestri reports that adult children of divorced parents are four times more likely to get divorced than adult children of intact couples. <p><b><center>The Myth of the Good Divorce</center></b> <p>
Another hindrance to public discussion of marital dissolution  is that many Americans still want to believe that divorce can lead to greater personal fulfillment and stronger relationships between men and women. In the closing scene of the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire, the central character offers some grandmotherly advice to a young girl trying to come to terms with her parents' break-up. "Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together," Mrs. Doubtfire says. "They don't fight all the time and they can become better people and much better mommies and daddies." <p>
However much many would like to believe this view of divorce, it is increasingly at odds with the experiences of both children and adults. A study at the University of Oregon found that the impact of divorce on a woman's health and well-being is far more serious than the impact of being fired. Another study, from the University of Alberta, shows that divorced or separated individuals are roughly three times as likely to commit suicide as married people. The University of Texas reports that "divorced men exhibit substantially higher rates of psychological distress and alcohol consumption than do married men." And David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research reports that "being divorced and a non-smoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying married."<p>
These and other research findings recently prompted an eclectic group of prominent scholars known as the Council on Families to issue a report decrying the state of marriage in America. The report observed, "In the domain of marriage and family life, our recent explosions of freedom have taken a terrible and largely unexpected toll. Relationships between men and women are not improving; they are becoming more difficult and more unhappy. Many women are experiencing chronic economic insecurity. Many men are isolated and estranged from their children. Many more people are lonely."<p><b><center>Rebuilding the Walls</b></center>
<p>
Over the last three decades, the walls surrounding lifelong marriage have crumbled. The age-old social barriers to divorce, promiscuity, illegitimacy, and cohabitation have been removed in the name of promoting personal freedom and self-expression. A growing number of peopleespecially those in Cobain's generationnow know first-hand that the walls that were thought to entrap and restrict were really there to protect.<p>
So how can the walls be rebuilt? How can confidence in the institution of marriage be restored? Although it would be a mistake to draw inspiration from the last three decades of welfare-state activism, there are some constructive models for addressing certain social problems. One such model is the anti-smoking movement.<p>
At a time when virtually every other area of American life was becoming more and more permissive, the anti-smoking movement succeeded in convincing the American public to adopt less permissive attitudes about smoking. Not only did many Americans change their own behavior (the proportion of adult smokers fell from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 25.6 percent in 1991), but Americans supported efforts to modify the behavior of others. <p>
The anti-smokers' success was due to many factors, including:<ul>
<li>
The careful collection and dissemination of compelling research on the health risks of smoking and inhaling second-hand smoke;<li>
The effective use of media persuasion, including articles, op-eds, essays, reports, and public-service advertisements;<li>
The tireless pursuit of incremental changes in public policy (limiting sales to minors, banning smoking on airplanes and in public buildings, etc.); <li>
The periodic sponsorship of special events (like the Great American Smoke-Out) to raise public awareness and spur private action;<li>
The ongoing provision of practical services (counseling, support groups, etc.) to people interested in behavioral change.</ul>
<p>
To restore confidence in marriage, we need a similar multidimensional strategy. This strategy should seek to repeat the anti-smokers' success, giving particular emphasis to the following four ideas:<p>
Focus on the future. For many people, the subject of divorce is intensely personal and extremely painful. It evokes bad memories and bitter feelings. As such, no attempt to restore public confidence in the institution of marriage is likely to succeed unless it is forward-looking. <p>
This means focusing public attention on lowering the divorce rate henceforth. And it means giving greater emphasis to the future choices of today's young people than to the choices made by their parents. "It may be unreasonable to expect a widespread change of heart about marriage among today's adults," states the Council on Families. "But young people can and often do strive to rebel, to be idealistic, and to do things differently than their elders."<p>
Indeed, in one marriage-related areasexualitythere is already evidence of a movement among today's young people to challenge norms ushered in by their parents' generation. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of young people have joined public campaigns pledging to save sex for marriage, and the proportion of high schoolers who report that they have had sexual intercourse at least once has declined by at least 6 percentage points since 1990.<p>
A youth-oriented campaign extolling the virtues of lifelong marriage is likely to win support from intact married couples. And it should win support as well from many who have experienced divorce, since most divorced parents want marital success for their children every bit as much as intact couples do. 	<p>
Still, success will not come easily. While many children of divorce long for the strong, enduring marriages their parents never had, many are wary of commitment and fear repeating their parents' mistakes. This is one reason cohabitation is so prevalent among the young. Yet, far from increasing the likelihood of marital success, "trial marriages" actually are linked to higher divorce rates. Indeed, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that 40 percent of cohabiting unions disintegrate before marriage, and that marital unions that begin as a cohabiting relationship have a 50 percent higher rate of divorce than those that do not. <p>
Challenge the church. No cultural institution is more important to the restoration of marriage than the religious community. Churches and synagogues claim a time-honored, divinely-ordained role to help couples understand the moral and spiritual nature of their marriage vows. Religious institutions bear a unique responsibility for helping those embarking on and struggling to maintain marriage commitments. Similarly, only faith communities can offer redemptive hope to people who have experienced marital failure.<p>
While religious leaders do not bear full responsibility for the absence of public discourse about divorce, they can hardly blame others for the failure of many marriages. Author Michael McManus notes that many churches have become "blessing machines" that wed interested couples but offer few marriage-related services, like counseling for engaged and married couples, practical advice on how to strengthen troubled marriages, and mentoring programs for younger couples.<p>
Sermons that warn against divorce or condemn the casual termination of marriages are not popular among some ministers, McManus says. Sermons that acknowledge that the Bible prohibits remarriage in some cases (Matthew 5:32) are even less popular, even though unqualified acceptance of divorce and remarriage can only discourage marital perseverance.<p>
The failure of the church (particularly the Protestant church) to significantly influence the surrounding culture can be seen in the fact that four of the six states with the worst divorce rates in the country (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) are found right in the heart of the Bible Belt.<p>
When religious leaders take seriously their responsibility for strengthening marriage in their congregations and their communities, divorce does decline. For example, several years ago, ministers in Peoria, Illinois, adopted a community marriage policy that stated none of the city's churches would marry any couple that had not completed a premarital counseling program. In the three-year period after the pact was adopted, Peoria's divorce rate fell nearly 20 percent.<p>
Elevate marriage in public policy. America's retreat from marriage is first and foremost a problem of the heart. It cannot be fixed by the issuance of a government decree or by the adoption of a new government policy. <p>
This does not mean, however, that reform of public policy has no place in a larger strategy to restore confidence in marriage. The law is a teacher. America's casual attitudes about marital permanence are both reflected in and advanced by laws that permit "no-fault" divorce in cases where one spouse wishes to preserve the union, and by laws that require some married couples to pay dramatically higher taxes than cohabiting couples.<p>
Reversing these misguided policies will not only help those directly affected by them, but will also teach others that lifelong marriage is the normative standard our society upholds. Thus, pro-marriage policy reform is both an end in itself, in that it corrects legal wrongs, and a means to an end, in that it stimulates a broader cultural appreciation of marital permanence.<p>
How, then, do we solve these problems? Michigan's state legislature is considering a divorce-reform proposal that would require the establishment of "fault" in cases where one spouse wants to preserve the marriage. This change (and a similar provision requiring "fault" in cases where children are involved) would make family abandonment more difficult by offering greater legal protection to innocent parties in divorce cases.<p>
In the tax front, three ideas deserve attention. Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute advocates the resurrection of "income-splitting," a practice that allows married couples to divide their total earnings evenly between them before assessing their tax liability. This practice prevents a second income from kicking couples into a higher tax bracketwhether that second income comes from a wage-earning wife or a moonlighting husband. <p>
Another tax option worth considering is a deduction that would adjust tax liability not just for marital status, but also for marital longevity. Tax benefits that modestly increase with each year that a couple stays together would allow a portion of the societal benefit associated with marital stability to be claimed by those who have been married the longest.<p>
Certainly, one must guard against wildly skewing the tax code to promote social goals. But if divorce truly imposes economic costs on society (higher crime, greater need for remedial education, higher health-care costs, and the like), then it may be beneficial to allow lifelong married partners to pay slightly lower taxes than their contemporaries who are married for the second or third time.<p>
Finally, we should consider eliminating "means-testing" in various government programs, since income-based limits on program eligibility tend to penalize marriage. Some married households with income above the threshold can qualify for benefits if they split up and form two separate households. Likewise, some cohabiting couples able to claim benefits as unmarried individuals would lose their benefits if they were to marry and combine their household income.<p>
Valorize marital toughness. There is a common misconception that couples who have good, solid, enduring marriages are "lucky." Supposedly, happily married couples do not face any of the conflicts and struggles that other couples face. They do not go through rough times or encounter serious relational turbulence.<p>
The truth is, every marriage faces trials and hardships and breakdowns in communication. Yes, some couples manage to limit conflict better than others, but every marriage faces difficulties. Ruth Bell Graham was once asked if she had ever contemplated divorcing her husband, evangelist Billy Graham. "No," she said, "but I have considered murder."<p>
If every marriage faces challenges, why is it that some survive and others do not? According to John Gottman, of the University of Washington at Seattle, couples that succeed work hard at resolving conflict. In his recent book, Why Marriages Succeed or Fail, Gottman argues that many of the theories about why some couples divorcemoney problems, sexual disagreements, incompatibility, and so onfail to explain why other equally dissatisfied couples confronting these very same issues do not split up. The real issue, Gottman concludes, is not money or sex or compatibility. The real issue, instead, is whether couples are willing and able to work out their marital differences.<p>
Research by social scientists Nick Stinnett and John DeFrain shows that one of the seven characteristics commonly found in strong, healthy families is the ability to deal effectively with conflict and crisis. Like Gottman, Stinnett and DeFrain find that couples who have to work through difficult problems believe that experience strengthens their marriages. This is important, because most public discussion about divorce revolves around whether divorce would be better than a marriage in which spouses are fighting all the time. This framework assumes falsely that a marriage gone sour can never be made sweet again. It encourages many couples to throw in the towel prematurely. <p>
David Blankenhorn, the president of the Institute for American Values, argues that a broad spectrum of marriages exists in America today. At one end are a small percentage of marriages that are almost effortlessly blissful; at the other, a small percentage that are headed for almost certain failure. Between these two extremes, Blankenhorn says, are the overwhelming majority of marriages: unions that can, with grit and perseverance, not only endure but prosper. <p>
Encouraging lasting commitment in a society that seeks instant gratification is no small challenge. But if it is true that people tend to do those things that are most apt to earn them a good reputation, then it follows that deliberate efforts to valorize marital toughness and perseverance are needed in everything from high-school textbooks to Hollywood movie scripts. At the very least, such efforts could help counterbalance existing cultural messages that undercut marital permanence and stability.<p>
Efforts to valorize enduring commitment should be particularly targeted at men, who historically have shown a greater propensity to neglect family responsibilities than have women. Turning the hearts of men to their families may do more to address divorce (and many other social problems) than any other proposed remedy. On this front, the most encouraging signs on the cultural landscape are the emergence of groups urging men to see that self-sacrifice is a defining characteristic of authentic masculinity. The National Fatherhood Initiative is devising strategies to restore the importance of fathers in society's thinking about family and community life. The National Center for Fathering helps provide dads with practical childrearing skills. The Promise Keepers movement challenges men to make and keep a set of pledges to their wives and families. This year, more than 600,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers conferences and seminars.<p>
Given the tenuous state of marriage in Americaand the tragic consequences of divorce on kids like Kurt Cobainone should hope that these efforts succeed. America desperately needs more men to commit themselves to their wives in the way that Theodore Roosevelt once did. On the day that his wife accepted his marriage proposal, Roosevelt wrote in his journal: "The aim of my whole life shall be to make her happy and to shield her and guard her from trial, and, oh, how I shall cherish my sweet queen. How she, so pure and sweet and beautiful can think of marrying me, I cannot understand, but I praise and thank God it is so."

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wadethe Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortionwe have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusionssuch as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participantsregardless of race, sex, or residencemost often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motivesin some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestringmany have no paid staffand they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobbywe had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do thatthey have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically27 percentwhile the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appealit's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortionlegal or illegaldestroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomesor, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>ashington is a city of monuments. Its grandest and most expensive is a work 
still in progress, but nearing completion: the District of Columbia itself, which 
commemorates the ruin of American liberalism.</P>
<P>	The D.C. government is bankrupt today because liberal policies have decimated 
its tax base. Washington is a hollow community of extreme rich and poor. Landlords and 
private employers have fled by the thousands, followed by nearly the entire middle class 
of taxpayers. Although Washington is the center of one of the most dynamic information-
based economies in the U.S, it has a declining population and a growing number of 
people below the poverty line. This year, twice as many households as in 1988 lack 
phones. In no other laboratory of democracy has the liberal experiment taken such pure 
form. Nowhere else have the results been so damning. </P>
<P>	The District is perhaps the most liberal city in America. Nine of every 10 
registered voters are Democrats, and the Socialist Workers Party fields more candidates 
for local office than the Republican Party. Conceived at the high tide of American 
liberalism, the District government is a product of its times, more concerned with the 
rights of groups than with the responsibilities of individuals. Many of the original office 
holders, political activists with no experience in private enterprise, are still in power 
today. The results are tragic. Among all U.S. states, the District has the highest per-capita 
murder and violent-crime rates, the highest percentage of residents on public assistance, 
the highest-paid school board, the lowest SAT scores, and the most single-parent 
families.</P> 
<P>	The political activists have built a government they can't afford. Although the city 
takes in an astounding $8,950 in revenue for every man, woman, and child in its 
jurisdiction (compared with $4,100 and $3,700 in nearby Maryland and Virginia, 
respectively), the District still manages to spend $1,000 more per person than it receives. 
The result is a budget deficit edging closer to $1 billion with each new audit. </P>
<P>	The victims of this ferociously progressive government are not the wealthy and 
privileged, but the middle class and beleaguered. Today, in some parts of the city, it 
seems entire neighborhoods are for sale. In places like Shepherd Park, Lincoln Park, 
Marshall Heights--communities once redolent of African-American pride and history--
there are lonely streets whose only splash of color appears on the real-estate signs that 
seem to sprout from every other garden plot. </P>
<P>	At the end of one of these streets stands the Florida Avenue Grill. From behind 
the counter of the often-crowded restaurant, Lacey Wilson Jr. has seen the District of 
Columbia ebb and flow. These days, it's mostly ebbing. Back in 1944, when Wilson's 
father opened his soul-food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th Street, 
near the LeDroit Park section of Northwest Washington, the city was a thriving 
community of educated descendants of freed slaves, flourishing family businesses, and 
urban sophistication. It was also a magnet of opportunity for blacks seeking to escape 
rural poverty. At mid-century, wartime Washington offered stable, well-paying white-
collar jobs in the federal bureaucracy. People came and put down roots. </P>
<P>	Eighteen years ago, when Lacey Wilson Jr. began working at the Grill full time, 
the neighborhood brimmed with well-kept houses and children playing. Today, the Grill 
stands alone in an otherwise vacant lot. In the short time since the District was granted 
home rule in 1974, Washington has gone from promised land to no-man's-land. "Most of 
the families who lived here have moved out to Maryland," says Wilson, himself a refugee 
to "the peace and quiet" of suburban Virginia. Those who stayed in the neighborhood, 
according to Wilson, are trapped in houses that have lost 30 percent of their value in the 
last eight years. </P>
<P>	Business used to be better, says Wilson. The vacant lot next door means more 
taxicabs can park at lunch time, but the crime that holds this city hostage each night has 
cut his after-dark dinner traffic by half. Proud of his restaurant's permanence in a 
turbulent world, Wilson stands below rows of signed photos of his famous patrons--
athletes, musicians, and local politicians, including a young Marion Barry glowing with 
promise before dissipation hardened his face and tarnished his reputation as a can-do 
mayor.</P>
<P>	Wilson and his patrons are concerned that Washington, once the incubator of 
America's black middle class, is now a place from which to escape. After reaching a peak 
population of 800,000, the city has withered to just 578,000 last year, and the trend has 
accelerated. Ten thousand residents desert the city each year. Even worse news is who is 
leaving: the homeowners, the entrepreneurs, the role models--in short, the black middle 
class. They are leaving for the suburbs, and with every defector, D.C. loses a taxpayer, 
which shrinks the tax base available for feeding a voracious welfare state that causes 
more frustrated residents to leave, and on and on.</P>
<P>	Census figures reveal that during the second half of the 1980s, 157,100 residents, 
or one-fifth of the entire population, moved out of the District. About half of those 
emigrants moved to Maryland and 12 percent to Virginia. According to the Greater 
Washington Research Center, black households earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year made up a disproportionate number of these refugees. In their place, affluent, single 
whites are moving into the city, but not enough to offset the loss. The result is a city 
rapidly dividing into segregated communities of economic extremes.</P>
<P>	Ask people at the Florida Street Grill about middle-class flight, and they'll tell 
you it is the little things that make life difficult in the District. Thomas Jones, finishing up 
his lunch before driving back to his job in Virginia, says it costs too much to live in the 
city. "Not just money," he says, "but time and aggravation." The Grill attracts an 
unusually diverse crowd for Washington, but there is agreement on one point: The 
government is no longer a neutral referee for self-sufficient citizens, but a muscular 
competitor against private enterprise. "For all the forms I need to fill out and all the 
inspections I'd have to have--and I'm not even talking about the fees and taxes," says 
one would-be entrepreneur, "why should I do business here? They've got open arms in 
Maryland. They make it easy there." A discussion soon erupts over the merits of 
suburban life, including such "innovations" as drive-through car registration, a one-stop 
business office where permits and licenses are issued, and same-day street repairs. The 
District, on the other hand, offers a notoriously slow motor-vehicles department, a 
bureaucracy suspicious of any profitable endeavor, and patchwork streets that haven't 
seen new asphalt in years. </P>
<P>	Wilson, Jones, and a number of other patrons own at least one rental unit in the 
city--often the place they used to live in. Thanks to the city government, these units are a 
steadier source of frustration than of income. The District has some of the most stringent 
rent-control and tenant's-rights provisions in the nation, but instead of helping 
disadvantaged renters, the laws tend to discourage rental activity. "It's not worth it to rent 
out your property," says Jones. He tells a harrowing story of a tenant who exploited all 
the rules to live, rent-free, for more than 16 months. "She had me in court. Never paid me 
anything, and she had the nerve to sue me!" Wilson and others at the counter nod 
knowingly. "I'll never rent out again," Jones declares. "After getting it up to code, what 
with rent control, it takes you 20 years to get your money back."</P>
<P>	Behind the cash register at the Florida Avenue Grill stands Edgar Featherson, a 
native Washingtonian with a quiet, genteel grace that reminds you of the once courtly 
city. After the lunch crowd dwindles, Featherson drives home through the LeDroit Park 
neighborhood in the early afternoon. The sidewalks overflow with students from the four 
public schools in the area. The children are a concern to Featherson.</P>
<P>	"They don't have the kind of family I was blessed with," he says. He is proud of 
his education, much of it the result of lessons his mother drilled into him years ago. The 
world has changed dramatically since then. He tells a story of the time he prepared dinner 
for his nephew and a friend from the neighborhood. "This boy had never seen anything 
like it. I made them put their coats away and wash their hands before we sat down," he 
recalls. "By the end of the night, you know that boy would not leave the house? He never 
had anyone telling him how to act, never had anyone treat him like a normal child." With 
a mixture of disgust and guilt, Featherson shakes his head. "This boy was so starved for 
love, he wouldn't leave." </P>
<P>	Featherson's nephew doesn't go to public school. He attends Archbishop Carroll 
High School in another part of town, partly because parents there are more involved in 
their children's education than they are in D.C. public schools. "If you don't show up at a 
parent-teacher meeting at Carroll, you get fined," he says. "They'd never try that in 
public school." To Featherson, public education is a mechanism for downward mobility, 
not a ladder out of poverty. "Look at Franklin Smith [the Superintendent of D.C. Public 
Schools]. He sends his kids to private school. He has a choice and he doesn't even send 
his own children to public school. Now what does that say about D.C. schools?" </P>
<P>	He mentions a news item from the Washington Times, reporting that in the 
seventh-grade "intensive" English class at one of the city's elite junior-high schools, not a 
single book was assigned to the class during the entire year. "And that's in the best 
schools," he says. "You can imagine what they're like in the rest of the city."</P>
<P>	John Robinson, another Grill customer, founded Black Diamond Industries in 
1976 to manufacture stainless-steel kitchen equipment for McDonald's and Wendy's 
restaurants. He exudes a world-weary optimism. His office is decorated with a yellowed 
picture of Jackie Robinson and a framed portrait of his mother. Robinson has not left the 
city yet. "This is where I live, my family is here, my church is here," he says. Still, the 
thought crosses his mind often.</P>
<P>	"Paperwork is my Achilles' heel," says Robinson. "With 20 employees, if I have 
one person doing nothing but government paperwork, non-income producing paperwork, 
then I've got 5 percent of my work force doing useless stuff." Robinson complains that 
he is a good employer in a city that needs private-sector job creation, yet the city ignores 
his needs. </P>
<P>	"The D.C. government doesn't care about my business--they don't see us we're 
so small--but it's businesses like this, with under 50 people, that are the real job 
producers," Robinson says. Washington has become something of a private-sector jobs 
vacuum. Job creation since 1980 has been anemic: 7 percent growth in employment, 
compared with 40 percent in suburban Maryland and 94 percent in suburban Virginia. 
Had D.C. managed to create jobs at the national average, it would have generated 80,000 
more jobs between 1980 and 1993.</P>
<P>	"Small business is about family and the community," says Robinson. "I work 
here. I live in the city. I hire people from the neighborhood. The government should be 
encouraging me, not just some big corporation. When I complain to the city government, 
they say `What's the problem? Every other business can do it. Why can't you?' But I'm 
not Marriott, I'm not MCI. I can't wait six weeks for an inspection or a permit. I'm out of 
business in six weeks. I could do about $100,000 more business a year if I didn't have so 
much paperwork," says Robinson.</P>
<P>	The solution to the worst of his problems is simple, Robinson says. "The city 
should announce tomorrow, `If you've got less than 50 employees, you don't need a 
license, you don't need a permit, all you have to do is pay taxes on time.' Just let me go 
to work. Nothing would make my life easier than that."</P>
<P>   If you drive along Minnesota Avenue in Anacostia, you'll see few private businesses. 
Many of the small outposts of enterprise are liquor stores, and likely owned by Korean-
born entrepreneurs. Douglas Kim, a small-businessman and head of the Korean-American 
Chamber of Commerce, says that nearly a third of all business licenses in the District of 
Columbia are held by low-capital Korean merchants. Recent immigrants often start up in 
the more hostile parts of the District. The risks may be higher, but the initial investment 
required is small compared to the more affluent suburbs. "After six or seven years," says 
Kim, "they move their business out of the city." Surveys show that 96 percent of all 
Koreans who own businesses in the District already live in the suburbs. </P>
<P>	Koreans are torn between the city and the suburbs, Kim says. The crime rate 
disturbs them. A recent survey showed that 89 percent of Korean merchants felt the 
police were "untrustworthy" or "very untrustworthy." But the biggest obstacle to a 
thriving Korean community in D.C. is the public-school system. "We come here for a 
better life for our children," says Kim, who lives in Virginia so his children can attend 
public schools there. "You know, it's the American dream." Kim's wife, who immigrated 
more recently, is still uncomfortable with the anonymity of the suburbs. "When my boys 
graduate," he says, "we'll move back to the city, but not now. --If there were excellent 
public schools in the District like there are in Virginia, all the Koreans would be living in 
the city tomorrow!"</P>
<P>	Many of the D.C. refugees are doubtless fleeing crime and the city government's 
inability to protect them from it. Don Scoggins, a refugee himself, is a real-estate broker 
who has helped hundreds flee bleeding neighborhoods. "Crime is more devastating to 
these communities than racism or Jim Crow ever was," says Scoggins, "but the city 
officials still think they're leading the civil-rights movement. They'd rather talk about the 
`root causes of crime' instead of locking up the criminals."</P>
<P>	To Scoggins, a black government worker-turned-entrepreneur, the story is 
depressingly routine. "The people running D.C. are more concerned with the people who 
can't take care of themselves," he says, "at the expense of the rest of us, the ones who 
have made an investment in the city's future." </P>
<P>	Joe Corey is a restaurateur in the upscale Glover Park section of Northwest D.C. 
Though his business required a large initial investment, he's not so different from the 
Korean merchants across town. When he had a chance to expand his business, he chose to 
open a restaurant in Virginia instead of D.C. "The taxes are too high, the bureaucracy is a 
mess," he says. "I told [former city council chairman] John Wilson on a radio call-in 
show that I wanted to stay in the city, but I couldn't afford the time and effort. You know 
what he told me? `Don't let the door hit you on the way out.' Is that anyway to treat a 
taxpayer?"</P>
<P>	It's the small things that make Corey think of leaving town--like the city's 
passion for writing parking tickets. Most residents will agree that the one thing the 
government does with breathtaking efficiency is issue tickets. "To them it's another 
source of income, so sure they write as many as they can, whether they're valid or not," 
says Corey. Since there's revenue at stake, the city for once turns to the lowest-cost 
provider, a private corporation called Lockheed Information Management. "The city is so 
shortsighted," says Corey. "They ticket my customers so they can raise a couple of 
hundred dollars in revenue, and they drive the customers away. They don't think of the 
business I'm doing and the taxes I'm paying. My business is worth much more to them in 
the long run than the few bucks they'll get from parking tickets." </P>
<P>   Corey perceives a hostile climate for business in the District. "They neglect you if 
you're a taxpaying business," he says. "When I call the city government, I can never get 
the right person on the phone or the right answer to a question. I can call down there on a 
Wednesday afternoon and no one answers the phone at all. But if I lose an employee, that 
guy gets unemployment benefits the next day, and God help me if I make a mistake with 
unemployment insurance. They're all over me." Corey speculates that career city 
employees are suspicious of anyone making money. "In this city, non-taxpayers are more 
privileged than the ones who are paying the taxes." As a result, many businessmen have 
fled the District, leaving behind an anemic economy in which the Washington Post and 
McDonald's are two of the largest private employers.</P>
<P>	For the Washingtonians who have invested their lives in District neighborhoods, 
there is sometimes no escape. Benjamin Thomas has lived in Benning Heights since 
1958. "It's a nice neighborhood, good working people," he says, but for five years the 
community has been besieged by drug dealers and the murderous outgrowth of their 
trade. "We're overrun by crime. I heard gunshots just last night and no one will respond." 
The breakdown of law and order is almost total. "We've got cars driving around here 
with no license plates, never been inspected, parked anywhere they come to a stop." 
Overwhelmed by violent crime, the police don't bother to enforce the basic laws that 
protect a neighborhood from chaos. "We're completely surrounded here," says Thomas. 
His home is now on a hostile frontier, and he sees little chance to escape. "Where can I 
go? Even if I find somebody who wants to buy my house, I won't have enough money 
even for a down payment anywhere else."</P>
<P>	Thomas places the blame squarely on the city government. "I've written letters to 
the mayor, to the city council, but no one ever answers. We're on our own out here." 
Thomas recalls the city was unresponsive even before the neighborhood disintegrated. "I 
fought 10 years to get a traffic light on Benning Road [a major point of entry to the city], 
and I never heard a thing from downtown."</P>
<P>	As Ray Dickey sees it, the transformation from neighborhood to no-man's-land 
begins at home. Dickey says he was the first black to move into the North Michigan Park 
neighborhood, back in 1957. "It starts when parents don't spend time with their kids, and 
don't let their children's friends in the house." The children eventually get the message 
that they're on their own, and they grow up not caring about anyone but themselves. 
"Neighbors don't even talk to each other anymore," says Dickey. "Now I live in a 
neighborhood of strangers. It's sad."</P>
<P>	North Michigan Park suffers from a disorder that no amount of government 
largess can remedy. "It's not about money," he says. "Money won't fix it. Government 
can't bring these people together and make them care." Dickey looks for non-government 
institutions to help bridge the gap, but finds them badly weakened by middle-class flight. 
"There are 10 churches in this neighborhood," says Dickey, "but they're not part of the 
neighborhood anymore. The people coming to church are all from the suburbs. They 
come on Sunday for an hour, then leave. The rest of the week, the doors are locked."</P>
<P>	A government's main mission is to ensure the safety of its citizens. Yet in the 
middle-class neighborhoods of Ward 6, the police presence has been cut back just when 
the neighborhood needs it the most. "I'm trapped in my own home," says Sheila Stamps, 
a widowed mother of five living in public housing on Capitol Hill. "You can't let 
children out by themselves, and the playground is littered with intravenous needles." 
Marion Barry, the newly elected mayor, recently threatened to withdraw the police from 
Ward 6 unless its city-council representative supported a controversial tax increase. This 
news brings Stamps to a boil. "You can't touch the police and the fire department. That's 
public safety. You can't touch that and expect people to stay here much longer."</P>
<P>	Stamps knows what's wrong with her city and what to do about it. "There are two 
things that must be there," she says. "Public safety and good schools." She wants the 
police to build a substation in her neighborhood so the same policemen can live and work 
in the area. "We need police here so they can live with the problem, so they'll know what 
it is like." Stamps also wants school choice. "Any child in this city should be able to go to 
the best schools," she says. "If they meet the criteria, let them go." She says the 
politicians and the media people who live in affluent Ward 3 don't want poor black 
children in their schools. "The president can send his child to any school he wants." she 
says. All she wants is the same opportunity. "We've got a lot of smart kids down here, 
hard-working kids. But they don't get the chance."</P>
<P>	Based on the liberal premise that poor citizens will always be poor and affluent 
citizens will always be affluent, the District government is perplexed that middle-class 
citizens are seeking opportunity elsewhere. After hundreds of tax increases, the city's 
ledgers are soaked with red ink. Despite employing tens of thousands of civil servants, 
even basic services are abysmal. The solution parroted by city officials has always been 
to grant statehood to the District. The reality is that the city government has squandered 
what sovereignty it has. More than 50 of the city's agencies are under court control, and 
the District owes $21 million in contempt-of-court fees due to its mishandling of its 
limited responsibilities. </P>
<P>	There can be no solution to the District's problems until the flight of middle-class 
families is stanched and reversed. That will require the District government to compete 
with its suburbs to provide the basic services middle-class taxpayers expect. The city can 
attract new residents by emphasizing public safety and quality public education, and by 
providing a competitive regulatory climate for entrepreneurs and a low-capital point of 
entry to the economy. Projects and services that do not add to the appeal of Washington 
as a place to raise a family can no longer be justified. The city must close the law school 
of the University of the District of Columbia, which produces no lawyers, privatize the 
appalling D.C. General Hospital, and lower its tax rates to compete with those of 
surrounding jurisdictions. </P>
<P>	The solution is hardly draconian. Other cities take great pride in performing the 
basics efficiently. Washington has the advantage of being the kind of city many people 
would like to live in. But it must first shed its Great Society heritage. The D.C. 
government has betrayed the very people it was intended to serve. True, it has succeeded 
in creating an integrated community where African-Americans can live in peace and 
thrive economically. Unfortunately, that community is just over the District line--in 
Maryland's Prince George's County.</P>
<P>	Why does Featherson stay in the District? "Well, it's like the Grill," he explains. 
"We've been here so long, for 50 years. I just hope there are some kids who walk by and 
think, `They've made it, they've been here through everything, they're proof you can 
make it if you work hard.' That's why I stay here. I want these kids to say `If Mr. 
Featherson can make it, maybe I can too.'"</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he most popular outdoor basketball court in New York City is half the regulation 
size, offers no place to sit, and has sidelines bounded by a chain-link fence 20 feet high. 
Those who play here are literally encaged. Yet this ridiculously inadequate court, on 
West 4th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, has drawn the likes of Denzel 
Washington and Julius Erving for pickup games. And the summer league based here is 
probably the most prestigious in the city. Each year, the West 4th Street League attracts 
more than 30,000 spectators--city-dwellers and tourists--who stand in blistering heat 
just to glimpse their favorite players and snap up league T-shirts at $12 apiece.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street basketball owes its popularity to the inner-city leadership of its 
volunteer commissioner, a limousine driver named Kenny Graham. With little support 
from city hall or local civic groups, he has spent the last 18 summers building the league 
into a New York institution. Lloyd Daniels, Mario Ely, Anthony Mason, Rod Strickland, 
and Jason Williams honed their skills here before going on to N.B.A. careers, and some 
of them still show up during the off-season. Former pros like Detroit's Kelly Tripuka mix 
it up with high-school dropouts.</P>

<H3>Midday Basketball</H3>
<P>	West 4th Street has developed its share of stars, but this is not the league's true 
purpose. In an era of commercialized sports, it is important to understand the 
contributions of a community league composed primarily of players whose glory days are 
over--25- to 35-year-olds with talent and pride, but no N.B.A. contracts. The league and 
its fans cherish players the media overlook, while putting sports and sportsmanship back 
into the community. It is midnight basketball played in broad daylight and without 
government handouts.</P>
<P>	A recent documentary film called <I>Hoop Dreams</I> dramatizes the pathos of the 
nearly-great athlete. William, a high-school phenom from Chicago, ponders his future as 
a scholarship recruit. In the final moments of the film, William reflects on all the people 
who've asked him,  "Will you still remember me when you're a big star in the N.B.A.?," 
and says, "I should've asked them, `Will you still remember me if I'm not?'" Promising 
inner-city players are typically groomed from the age of 12 or so. This process has 
obscured the virtues of athletic competition and replaced them with illusions of easy 
wealth. For a lucky few, lucrative professional careers represent a materialistic triumph 
and escape from the neighborhood.Graham's league, on the other hand, showcases those 
who cannot escape, who must remain behind and make their community work.</P>
<P>	"I started working there refereeing league games for $10 a game," Graham recalls. 
"The next year the league was falling apart and no one wanted to take over, so I decided I 
would be commissioner."</P>
<P>	Founded in 1968, the league had struggled along for several years with only eight 
teams, unreliable funding, and a shortage of referees. Today, Graham runs the oldest 
summer-basketball program in New York City. There is a game every day of the week in 
June, July, and August, five on Saturdays and Sundays. Each year, more than 600 players 
altogether participate in the 24-team men's division, a women's division of six teams, and 
an eight-team division for boys 15 and under. Its prowess is known nationwide. Last year, 
the Summer Pro-League outdoor championship, sponsored by Nike and shown on ESPN, 
was won by the defending champions from New York. But that team, which defeated a 
Chicago squad in the finals by 30 points, had finished second at West 4th Street.</P>
<P>	Youth teams have come from as far away as Seattle and France to play in the 
preliminary games before the seniors begin, but collegiate players rarely play here 
because the league is not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. In his youth division, Graham 
prefers to work with younger, pre-high-school players, because high-school-age youths 
are often spoiled and difficult to control.   "We have trouble getting teams with 
responsible adults to control the players," he says. "It can be very difficult to talk to them. 
Last summer, we had high-school-age girls' teams, and fighting became a problem. At 
age 13 to 14, the kids will listen."</P>
<P>	The tiny court must hold two referees and 10 quick and often large players, so 
personal fouls proliferate. That makes refereeing difficult. "No one wanted to come down 
there to ref because West 4th Street was very rough," Graham says. "The first year I was 
commissioner, we had only one incident, and I took a stand. The players knew right then 
that I would not walk away from a problem." Arizona Pearson, who has played in the 
league for 11 years and now directs its youth program, has watched Graham keep the 
peace. "Kenny gets in the middle," he says, "but you have to do that, you have to be in 
control. With Kenny, it takes a lot to get him upset. If there's shouting and threatening, 
people apologize afterward."</P>
<P>	The cramped conditions also make ball control extremely difficult. Passing lanes 
are limited, and it is much easier here than in the N.B.A. for a defensive player to 
abandon his man to attack the dribbler or the post-up man waiting to turn and shoot. At 
the same time, the New York style of playground basketball frowns upon the staid jump 
shot in favor of the driving lay-up, with its infinite possibilities for blind pass-offs or shot 
creation. These factors produce a game of ferocious strength, speed, and competitiveness. 
The discipline and control of this style amazes outsiders and accounts for the league's 
popularity.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street smoothes the transition for many of the 98 percent of New York's 
good collegiate players who do not make it to the pros. The close of a competitive career 
can prompt an emotional letdown and demoralize young men with leadership abilities. 
Tony Hargraves was the co-captain of Iona College's basketball team in 1984-85 and was 
named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press, but he could not get 
a professional contract. Now an operations manager at Bear Stearns with a home and 
family in the suburbs, he continues to play regularly in the cage. "Good players still have 
a desire to play against people at their own level," Hargraves explains, "and West 4th 
Street offers this." When N.B.A. players show up, regulars treat them with respect, but 
they also relish the chance to show up the pro athletes.</P>
<P>	"The small court makes you do all the right things," Hargraves explains. "It 
improves your game. This is a place where you cannot continue to make mistakes. 
Anthony Mason [a power forward with the New York Knicks] is a prime example. West 
4th Street defined his game. He learned he had to move much more quickly. He became 
one of the stronger players in the city, and now he's one of the stronger players in the 
N.B.A."</P>

<H3>Respect Without Fear</H3>
<P>	I first became drawn to these players in the early 1980s, when I saw in their 
character something missing in the bright young MBAs at our big Wall Street trading 
firm. I saw in young players like Tony Sherman (who still plays) and Mario Ely (who 
won a championship ring with the Houston Rockets last year) awe-inspiring toughness, 
masculinity, and personal pride. These players are courteous but not chatty, fearless but 
disciplined. The better players have grit and a capacity for physical exertion that, I fear, 
our increasingly computerized society seems to devalue.</P>
<P>	Pearson sees the role of competitive basketball in the city quite clearly: "Of 
course it is fun, you can work off frustrations. But it's really about getting respect. That's 
what living in the city is about, you know." At West 4th Street, that means being looked 
up to by others. It's not the same as the fashionable notion of "self-esteem," which is of 
little use on the streets.</P>
<P>   Kenny's idea of respect is not built on fear. "I'm not militant and I'm not a cult leader," 
he explains. "I want people to learn they gain respect if they give respect. That's the 
bottom line.... Often black organizations are poorly run, and I tell players, `When you 
carry on, you reinforce stereotypes. If you make us and the league look bad, we could 
wind up with no league--and then you would have no chance to showcase your talents, 
we want a mutual respect for peers.... And respect for a program and an organization.... 
You can teach respect. I do it by talking, by challenging a person mentally. People judge 
others by their behavior, and I tell people that in their actions they represent their 
heritage, their culture, their race. A lot of so-called black leaders won't challenge black 
people about their behavior. It's easier to tell them [their problem is] white people."</P>
<P>   Fans must arrive early to reserve a good spot at courtside. For big games--the playoffs 
or the all-star game--youngsters sit on the fence or hang from tree branches. Graham or 
one of the staff wits uses a bullhorn to announce the games, and their commentaries are 
humorous, improvisational performances.</P>
<P>	The league has become an integral part of the lives of its 600-plus participants. 
Most of the players do not live in the neighborhood. They come mainly from Brooklyn, 
Harlem, or the Bronx to the playground here because they like to play before the big 
crowds in the Village.</P>
<P>	Sid Jones, a Brooklynite who has been coaching winning teams for 15 years, is 
particularly attuned to the sense of community the league has developed. "Generally, 
people don't spend time getting to know each other, but at this park, you meet people," 
Jones says. "The people you meet may help you in other parts of your life. Kenny and the 
league have been bringing people together for years, and it's now a community. You 
wonder, why can't people get along like this outside of sports? --Just about every 
subway line stops here, so you get people from all walks of life. It's a real melting pot. 
Players will come here when they won't go everywhere else. And I'll tell you, when you 
win a big game down here, you don't want to go home."</P>
<P> 	The city government provides the league nothing except a permit to play. "They 
are not that concerned with us," Graham says, "because they see we are doing OK. They 
are worried about their own programs. Occasionally a mayor will come down here to help 
get some votes. ... But they are not here to help the league."</P>
<P>   Graham never passes the hat. He and a few of his staff were once granted the status of 
part-time employees by the New York City Parks Department, but that was discontinued 
years ago. Money to run the league now comes exclusively from entry fees--$500 per 
team--and corporate sponsors. The principal sponsor for the last two years has been Fila 
Inc., a sportswear manufacturer, which subsidizes uniforms and gives sneakers to each 
team. Since 1986, Nobody Beats the Wiz has provided television sets for the winners of 
the Most Valuable Player and Sportsmanship awards. The nearby McDonald's feeds the 
staff more than 500 free meals each summer. The maker of Olde English 800 malt liquor 
provides a scoreboard and money for trophies and shorts.</P>
<P>	None of the league's successes--its local following, corporate sponsorship, and 
national recognition--would be possible without its reputation for serious, disciplined 
basketball. So Graham insists upon high standards of behavior. A public league held in a 
public park draws all kinds, and no one can be refused admission, but Graham works hard 
to maintain the dignity of the league. Sometimes a player or fan will challenge this. "One 
day right after a game, a guy on one of the teams dropped his pants," he recalls. "I didn't 
think it was funny. I laced into him something fierce. I embarrassed him right on the spot. 
What he did was totally wrong." As commissioner, Graham's decisions are final. If a 
player starts fights or disgraces the league in any way, he is banned for the season.</P>
<P>	Graham is a gifted leader who embodies positive thinking--necessary for 
entrepreneurs, but rare among administrators. Graham also takes great pride in delivering 
what he promises. Once when the TV prizes were held up due to a clerical snafu, he 
didn't hesitate to cover the costs. (Eventually, he was reimbursed.)</P>
<P>	Graham's devotion to excellence and good manners filters throughout the 
neighborhood. Good-humored and charismatic, he can quickly summon dozens of helpers 
to do whatever is needed--keeping score or sweeping the court before games. 
Afterwards, they leave the whole area cleaner than before. In this way, even street people 
become part of the league culture. "We take all kinds," says Graham. "We're all human 
beings. Sometimes people will tell me to get rid of a guy who maybe has a drinking 
problem. I say, if a man has a problem and I can help him, I will. Everybody can't be on 
the level we'd like them to be. Some guys have gone through their whole lives being 
rejected, but I will help somebody who wants to be helped. I can deal with them."</P>

<H3>Creating an Identity</H3>
<P>	Graham is proud of the fact that the league plays a part in the lives of many 
players and staff, even those who do menial work. "Many guys down here are not part of 
anything but a joint or a bottle of wine," he says. "We give them an identity above that 
stuff." Graham, who shuns smoking and alcohol, does not allow even surreptitious 
drinking in the park during games. He has also been known to chase smokers away, even 
though smoking is legal. He feels it creates a bad atmosphere for the kids who come to 
watch. He often reminds players that they are "guests" in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>   Even those who never became professional grow as players and as individuals. One of 
these is Tony Sherman, one of the best players in the league never to enjoy a good prep 
career or go to college. "He used to live down there," says Hargraves. "Every day at 3 
o'clock he'd be there working on his game. He's now a great player, and he's done it 
without a good high school record or any college experience.--At the park he became 
popular and he gained respect. That's a big thing in New York City." Pearson agrees: 
"Sherman's grown a lot. He could have been a troublemaker, but he watches his mouth 
now."</P>
<P>	Graham says Sherman has gradually earned the recognition he craves for his 
talent. He has come to follow the example set by Graham and some of the older players, 
and takes defeats with dignity.</P> 
<P>   "Sherman was once the king of the park," says Graham. "Many guys respected him out 
of fear. Now he's older, he's got responsibilities. I think he's realized that people give 
him respect. It's an important difference."</P>
<P>   Last year, then-Governor Mario Cuomo inaugurated the New York State Midnight 
Basketball League at a celebrity function in uptown Manhattan. The governor told the 
out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters for whom the league was created that "we have 
not done well by you, [but] we'll try to make it up to you." This was not the spirit that 
made West 4th Street.  Graham is not driven by paternalism or guilt, nor even by 
altruism. Like his players, he is motivated instead by a need for personal recognition and 
respect from the players and the basketball community. "It's nice to have people say, `I'm 
glad you're back,'" he says. Players and staff alike seek the rewards that come with 
excellence, not charity. "I tell them you don't have to love me--but you should respect 
me."</P>
<P>	Graham believes that other communities can duplicate the success of West 4th 
Street. First, he says, "develop a following. Develop a symbol. Our symbol is West 4th 
Street, playing in a cage. Our shirts are known all over New York--every kid wants one." 
Second, "develop people with character. You've got to let people know that you don't 
have to be out there, you've got a job and other things in your life. They can't just do 
what they'd like to."</P>
<P>	Sociologists like to point out that chaos and disorder are common aspects of 
malfunctioning inner-city families. One of Graham's greatest talents is for organization: it 
is he, not some government agency, that provides continuity for these New Yorkers. The 
order originates within the community rather than being imposed from without. There are 
lots of Kenny Grahams in every community. If such leaders are encouraged, they will 
come.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<h3> CHILDREN AND FAMILY IN AMERICA: CHALLENGES FOR THE 1990S </h3><P>

<b> By Wade F.  Horn, Ph.D.</b><br>
July 23, 1991<br>

<P>

     When I walked into my first meeting of the National Commission on
Children, I looked around the room and, observing that two-thirds of
the Commission were liberal Democrats, thought to myself, "What's a
good conservative like me doing in a place like this?"  Indeed, at the
beginning, at least, given the makeup of the Commission, the idea that
the final report would be anything that a conservative could support
seemed to be inconceivable.
<P>
     But, almost two years later, I did vote for the Commission's
final report, something which has prompted many of my friends to ask
me, and some not quite so politely, "What's a supposedly good
conservative like you doing voting for a report like that?"
<P>
     Today, I will attempt to answer that question, hopefully to the
satisfaction of my conservative friends here at The Heritage
Foundation.  But before doing so, I would like to first share my sense
of the status of children and families in America as well as some
basic principles which I believe should guide public policy in this
area.
<P>
     When one reads newspaper accounts of the status of children in
America, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the statistics -- and
some of the statistics are overwhelming:
<P>
 <UL> one million children abused and neglected every year;
<P>
     over 400,000 children living away from their families in
     substitute care;
<P>
     one in five children living in poverty.</UL>
<P>
     Statistics like these makes one wonder if there are any happy
children left in America
<P>
     The fact is, however, that although there are children who are
abused and neglected by their parents, the vast majority of children
are being raised by parents who care for and nurture them; although
there are children who are living away from their families in foster
care, the vast majority of children are living in homes with their own
parents; and although there are too many children living in poverty,
the vast majority of children do live in circumstances where their
material needs are adequately met.  The truth is that most children
are doing quite well, in spite of what we do in Washington.
<P>
     Upside Down View. But many so-called child advocates do not like
to emphasize this side of these statistics.  Instead, many child
advocates like to engage in what I call the "Poseidon Adventure"
school of child welfare -- the proclivity of many child advocacy
groups to turn the world upside down so that it appears that a happy
American childhood is a relic of the past.
<P>
     Adherents to such an upside down view of the world often become
uncomfortable when reminded that most American children are, in fact,
healthy, happy and secure, and living in loving, caring families. 
There was even a moment, about midway through the National
Commission's work, when some Commission members actually expressed
disappointment when told of the results of a public opinion survey,
which the Commission funded, which found that most American families
and communities are alive and well, that most parents are involved in
their children's lives, and that most parents and children feel good
about their family relationships.  It is quite interesting to note
that although the survey was originally intended to be an appendix to
the final report, the Commission's final report neglected to include a
summary of the results of this survey.  In psychology we call that
"selective forgetting."
<P>
     But just because most children in America are, in fact, healthy,
happy and secure, does not mean we should neglect to attend to those
who are at risk, whose chances for success are seriously endangered. 
We know, for example, that every day:
<P>
     <UL>2,500 children are born out of wedlock;
<P>
     700 low birthweight babies are born;
<P>
     135,000 children bring a gun to school;
<P>
     7,700 teenagers become sexually active;
<P>
     1,100 teenagers have abortions;
<P>
     600 teenagers get syphilis or gonorrhea; and
<P>
     6 teenagers commit suicide.</UL>
<P>
     After acknowledging that some children are, indeed, at-risk of
poor developmental outcomes, we must then ask why.  Conventional
wisdom says that families are buffeted by external forces -- economic
or whatever -- that are simply beyond their control.  This answer
drives a policy that relies on government intervention into family
matters.  It's no shock to people in this room that this has
essentially been our family policy for twenty-five years, and it
hasn't worked.
<P>
     I brought a much different perspective to the National Commission
on Children -- that much of what threatens our children results from
individual decisions and behaviors on the part of adults -- decisions
like abusing alcohol and drugs, having children out of wedlock, and
neglecting one's responsibility to support children both emotionally
and financially following a divorce.
<P>
     We know, for example, that adult drug abuse, and especially the
use of "crack cocaine," is the single most important factor behind the
escalating numbers of abused and neglected children in the United
States, as well as the rapid rise in the number of foster care
placements.  We also know that perhaps as many as 375,000 children
each year are starting off life already handicapped because parents
chose to "share" their drug habit with their unborn child.
<P>
     We also have a popular culture which chooses to, on a daily
basis, bombard developing children with messages that drugs are cool,
teenage sex is wonderful, parents don't know anything, and hard work
is for nerds.
<P>
     Mythology of Relativism. But perhaps most devastating of all, is
the fact that our culture has spent the last several decades deeply
inculcating a mythology -- the mythology of family relativism -- the
misguided belief that family structure is irrelevant, that no
configuration of family is better than any other.  Indeed, the need to
even form a family is questioned.  Family relativism lets us stop
worrying about many of our children, because it tells us that divorce
and single parenting have no real impact upon children.  And it
convinces us that something called "quality time" makes up for
unconnected parents.
<P>
     And how successful this mythology has been.  About half of
today's children will spend some time in a single-parent family before
they reach the age of 16.  Many children will attain single-parent
family status through divorce.  About half of all marriages today will
end in divorce and about one-half of all children whose parents do
divorce will experience a second divorce before they are 16 years old.
<P>
     For many other children the pathway to single-parent families is
through the failure of family formation.  Today, over 25 percent of
children now begin life in a single parent household; among blacks,
the figure is over 60 percent.
<P>
     Most Important Variable. The increasing numbers of children being
raised in single parent households is important because family
structure is the most important variable related to successful
outcomes for children.  As a group, children from one-parent families
exhibit above average rates of youth suicide, mental and physical
illness, violence, and drug use.  And the connection between crime and
single-parent homes is so strong that, when one controls for family
configuration, the relationship between crime and race as well as
crime and low-income disappears.
<P>
     There is also a strong relationship between single-parenting and
being raised in poverty.  According to David Elwood, single-mother
families have a poverty rate, after government transfers, of 38
percent, as compared to only 6 percent for two-parent families. 
Seventy-three percent of children in this country growing up in
single-parent families are poor for some time before age ten, as
compared to only 20 percent of children living in two-parent families. 
Indeed, the real reason more children are living in poverty today
compared to two decades ago is not because of any supposed decimation
of domestic spending by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, but
because the proportion of all children living in single-parent
households has more than doubled from 11 percent in 1970 to 25 percent
in 1990.
<P>
     This is particularly striking for blacks, where over the past two
decades the poverty rate for black children in single parent
households has remained nearly constant at about 65 percent, whereas
the poverty rate for black children in two-parent families actually
declined from 26 percent in 1970 to 19 percent in 1988.  The reason
why poverty among black children continues to be high despite
declining poverty rates for black children growing up in two-parent
families is that many more black children are being brought up in
single-parent families today compared to just two decades ago.
<P>
     Yet despite this mounting evidence, the connection between
single-parenting and poor outcomes for children has largely been
ignored in the development of public policy.  As Karl Zinsmeister
wrote in the June 1990 issue of the Atlantic Monthly:
<P>
    <UL> For the past quarter century American public policy has
     shied away from the idea that certain family forms are more
     desirable than others.  There is no attempt to promote child
     bearing within wedlock.  There is little penalty attached to
     child abandonment.  There is scant recognition of the social
     benefits of marriage, or of the social contributions of
     those who devote themselves to conscientious childrearing. 
     There is no reward from our public programs for standing by
     kith and kin.</UL>
<P>
     And a family that remains a family today spends less time being a
family.  William Mattox pointed out in last winter's Policy Review
that "parents today spend 40 percent less time with their children
than did parents in 1965."  A quote Mattox uses from Harvard
University child psychiatrist Robert Coles is a concise description of
the legacy of family relativism:
<P>
    <UL> Parents are too busy spending their most precious capital --
     their time and their energy -- struggling to keep up with
     MasterCard payments.  They're depleted.  They work long
     hours to barely keep up, and when they get home at the end
     of the day they're tired.  And their kids are left with a
     Nintendo or a pair of Nikes or some other piece of crap. 
     Big deal.</UL>
<P>
     Given this situation, what should be the proper role of
government in addressing these issues.  I believe that several
principles should guide us:
<P>
     First, the federal government should play an important leadership
role by elevating the discussion of these issues through "bully
pulpit" activities and by inspiring others to focus their resources
and energies on addressing these pressing concerns.  Department of
Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.  Louis Sullivan has been
especially effective in using this "bully pulpit" to elevate these
issues through his calls for the resurgence of a "culture of
character" and "communities of concern," as well as his advocacy of
healthy lifestyles.
<P>
     Second, we need to examine current social policies to determine
which may create perverse incentives that actually cause family
dissolution or a failure to form in the first place.  There are, for
example, instances where rents in public housing authorities skyrocket
should a single mother choose to marry.  And there is mounting
evidence that no-fault divorce laws may make family breakup too easy
an option, by leading to the impression that there is such a thing as
a "relatively painless divorce" -- a notion that is never true when
children are involved.
<P>
     Third, while government should continue to provide cash and non-
cash assistance to those who find themselves in poverty due to
circumstances beyond their control, there should be a recognition of a
reciprocity in government benefit programs -- that is, if one gets,
one has an obligation to give something back.  That was one of the
ideas behind the Family Support Act, as well as programs like Mom's
Place in Pennsylvania where single moms get quality child care in
exchange for going to school, getting good grades, and cleaning up the
center at the end of the child care day.
<P>
     Fourth, government needs to ensure that money earned by the
working poor is money brought home by the working poor.  That was the
idea behind the recent expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
<P>
     Fifth, the federal government should continue to fund well-
targeted programs designed to promote familial self-sufficiency by
combatting parental behaviors that tend to perpetuate long-term
welfare dependency -- programs like Head Start and JOBS.  But in doing
so, we should be careful not to confuse good intentions for effective
programs.  Consequently, before bringing every "good idea" to scale,
we should engage in the difficult work of determining program
effectiveness through research and evaluation studies.
<P>
     Finally, government programs and services should always be
designed to empower parents and strengthen families through maximizing
choice and local control of programs.
<P>
     So how does all of this square with the final report of the
National Commission on Children?  First, it is important to state that
I do not agree with everything contained within the final report. 
Indeed, I have some significant reservations about the final report
which I highlight in my letter of reservation contained in an appendix
in the report.  But there is much that I do endorse.
<P>
     First of all, the Commission resisted the temptation of "Poseidon
Adventure" thinking, and actually kept the statistical thinking right-
side-up, stating in the opening paragraph of the report that:
<P>
 <UL> Most American children are healthy, happy, and secure.  They
     belong to warm, loving families.  For them, life is filled
     with the joys of childhood -- growing, exploring, learning
     and dreaming -- and tomorrow is full of hope and promise.</UL>
<P>
     Similarly, the report states in the chapter on preparing
adolescents for adulthood:
<P>
    <UL> The majority of young people emerge from adolescence
     healthy, hopeful, and able to meet the challenges of adult
     life... They are progressing in school, they are not
     sexually active, they do not commit delinquent acts, and
     they do not use drugs or alcohol.</UL>
<P>
     Furthermore, the Commission did what it had to do if it wanted to
be honest to its mission of helping children -- it rejected family
relativism.  Indeed, one of the guiding principles for the entire
report states:
<P>
    <UL> Children do best when they have the personal involvement and
     material support of a father and a mother and when both
     parents fulfill their responsibility to be loving providers.
<P>
     Even more incredibly, the report goes on to state:
<P>
     Rising rates of divorce, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and
     absent parents are not just manifestations of alternative
     lifestyles, they are patterns of adult behavior that
     increase children's risk of negative consequences.
<P>
     And:
<P>
     There can be little doubt that having both parents living
     and working together in a stable marriage can shield
     children from a variety of risks.</UL>
<P>
     Not exactly a death knell perhaps, but plenty to make the
faithful followers of family relativism nervous.

     Talking About Values. In addition, the Commission report actually
talks about values, and about morals.  Not just talks about it, but
devotes an entire chapter to it, entitled "Creating a Moral Climate
for Children."  The very existence of this chapter reflects the belief
of the Commission that not all problems are solved by government
programs, but rather are best overcome by developing moral values in
children, and, in the words of Secretary Sullivan, a "culture of
character."
<P>
     And now we've got the moral relativists on the phone to the
family relativists, and they're both wondering what in the world
happened.
<P>
     Significantly, the Commission also endorsed public school choice. 
While not going as far as I and other members wanted to go -- which is
to include private schools as well -- it is a major push for parental
empowerment, and a recognition that the current educational
establishment is failing our nation's schools.
<P>
     And finally, the report reflects the view that the most effective
ways to help families achieve economic self-sufficiency are to:  1)
encourage the formation and stability of two-parent families; 2) make
work pay through the Earned Income Tax Credit; and 3) develop a
strategy for countering the decade-long tilt in the tax code against
families with children.
<P>
 <UL> For example, the report states:
<P>
     Clearly, living in a stable, two-parent family with one or
     both parents employed is the child's best hope for escaping
     poverty and having his or her basic material needs met. 
     Government should therefore actively encourage work,
     independence, and strong families.</UL>
<P>
     Flawed Proposals. Unfortunately, the Commission's major proposal
of a $1,000 refundable tax credit for children is flawed by a failure
of the liberal majority to explicitly tie the refundable nature of the
tax credit to a reduction in other government benefit programs.  As an
"add on" to welfare, such a refundable tax credit could potentially
lead to an increase in single-parenting, a violation of one of the
report's guiding principles.
<P>
     The report is also flawed by its failure to develop a reasonable
plan for paying for its proposals.  It's fair to say that a majority,
if not all, of the liberal Commissioners supported some sort of tax
increase -- although most of their ideas for increasing taxes reflect
the traditional liberal philosophy of, "I won't tax you, I won't tax
me, so I'll tax that guy behind the tree!"
<P>
     Some of us, on the other hand, considered the notion of paying
for a cut in taxes by raising taxes as ludicrous, and circular
thinking at its worst.  In our view, a program designed to support
families can not further erode their economic power with new taxes. 
More reasonable approaches put forth by a minority of members of the
Commission involved curtailing federal spending by cutting some
expenditures or capping growth in domestic spending.
<P>
     The Commission also did not reach consensus on health care.  The
liberal Democrats on the Commission endorsed a national health
insurance scheme which is essentially a repeat of the recommendations
of the Pepper Commission -- a previous Rockefeller-chaired commission
that also could not reach consensus on this issue.  Unfortunately, as
we stated in our minority chapter on health, the Rockefeller-endorsed
"play or pay" proposal would invariably lead to higher taxes, a
substantial loss of jobs, and discrimination against employees with
families -- a result which I find unconscionable for a National
Commission supposedly concerned about the welfare of families with
children.
<P>
     Positive Results Also. Nonetheless, and despite these
shortcomings and unfortunate events, I believe the message of the
report isn't lost, and shouldn't be wasted by conservatives.  For
years now we have been attacking mainstream policy thought as off the
mark, completely missing the issues and concerns that really matter to
families, and that can really make a difference to children.  The
result has been, as Zinsmeister says, a public policy that provides
"no reward... for standing by kith and kin."
<P>
     Now we have a report that pushes two-parent families, recognizes
the importance of values and morality, endorses school choice, and
acknowledges that what families need is not more government programs,
but to be allowed to keep more of the money they earn.
<P>
     The report has also helped to further sharpen the distinctions
between conservatives and liberals -- concerning both the proper role
for government in family matters and the way we pay for government. 
For example, the existence of two health chapters indicates that
liberals are for government mandates without regard for costs, either
in terms of increased taxes or job loss.  Liberals apparently are even
willing to tolerate discrimination against employees with families in
the name of government mandates.  Conservatives, on the other hand,
believe in empowering consumers and permitting undistorted markets to
function in medical care and health insurance as a means of providing
the best health care for the most people while targeting public
programs to those most in need.  In addition, the lack of consensus on
how to pay for the report's recommendations reveals that liberals
continue to refuse to even flinch at the idea of raising taxes,
whereas conservatives believe government should do everything it can
to keep taxes low and federal budget deficits small.
<P>
     But there is a danger in the report.  It may be, as some suspect,
that the liberals on the Commission didn't really believe in any of
the conservative rhetoric contained in the report and only agreed to
include it in order to obtain a unanimous vote.  Perhaps that's why
the title of the report, chosen after the final vote, reads "Beyond
Rhetoric."  So we must work hard at holding the liberal Commissioners'
feet to the fire, and insist that they remain true to the rhetoric and
message of the report.  We must constantly remind the liberal
Commission members that they endorsed the idea that the best way out
of poverty is not some government program, but rather for single
parents to get and stay married.  We must remind them that they
endorsed the idea of school choice precisely because the present
school establishment has failed our nation's children.  And we must
remind them that they endorsed the idea that the mass media must be
more responsible in their messages to children regarding drugs, sex
and hard work because moral values are important -- and in the long
run even more important than government programs.  Then let them
answer why "good liberals like them voted for a report like this."

Backgrounder Update No. 283<BR>
January 13, 1997<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">(Updating <A HREF="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup273.html"><I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 273</A>, "Warning to North Korea: Stop Provocations and Talk Peace with South Korea," April 12, 1996)</FONT>
<P>
<DD>

Tensions between North and South Korea have risen even higher since the communist regime in Pyongyang sent a spy submarine into South Korean waters last September. Washington and Seoul pressured North Korea to make amends for the hostile act, but Pyongyang's recent statement of "regret" fell far short of the mark. While the Clinton Administration -- anxious to get its two-year old political agreement with the North back on track -- welcomed the statement as acceptable, a lingering problem for President Clinton will be the fact that North Korea has not made it clear that it will engage in serious peace talks with Seoul as mandated by the U.S.-North Korea deal inked in Geneva.

<P>
<DD>
The baseline of Clinton Administration policy toward the belligerent communist regime in North Korea is the Agreed Framework signed between the U.S. and the North on October 21, 1994. At that time, Pyongyang was threatening to continue producing even more weapons-grade plutonium than it already possessed, thereby making itself a fledgling nuclear power.

<P>
<DD>
President Clinton's Geneva deal was heralded as the successful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis and the beginning of a process of North-South reconciliation that would reduce the very high level of tensions on the Korean peninsula. As part of the deal, North Korea promised to "engage in North-South dialogue, as this Agreed Framework will help create an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue."  In a January 31, 1995, speech at The Heritage Foundation, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard said that Pyongyang's violation of this pledge would be "a deal breaker."  The North is obligated "to engage in serious and substantive dialogue with the South."  Otherwise, the deal eventually will "break down."  The agreement with Washington can succeed, Hubbard concluded, only if there exists "a climate of civility and pragmatic cooperation between North and South."

<P>
<DD>
Two years after the Clinton Administration set these standards, serious dialogue between the two sides has yet to happen. Furthermore, the North repeatedly has engaged in provocative behavior that has caused tensions on the Peninsula to rise to their highest level in years. The discovery of the North Korean spy submarine in the South's waters last September, and the landing of the vessel's armed commando unit in southern territory, resulted in clashes that left 37 dead, including a dozen South Koreans. This act of aggression seriously undermined relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, and has serious implications for the U.S. There are 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea -- a presence on the Peninsula that costs the American taxpayer more than $2 billion annually. Seoul, however, has lost confidence in Washington's judgment, and many South Koreans openly regard President Clinton's flexible "engagement" policies toward the North as appeasement.

<P>
<DD>The Clinton Administration has said that Pyongyang's refusal to engage in serious peace talks with Seoul is a "deal breaker."  Yet it continues to ask the American people to support its call for Congress to appropriate around $30 million per year to provide for benefits pledged by the U.S. under the Agreed Framework. It is time for the Administration to press the North to live up to its side of the bargain.

<P>
<B>The Geneva Deal: Plenty of Carrots</B>

<P>
<DD>
In the early months of his first term, President Clinton's foreign policy advisors spoke of using a "carrot and stick" approach in dealing with a menacing North Korea. Negotiated in an effort to stop the North's nuclear weapons program, the October 1994 Agreed Framework offered benefits to the North that included gradual improvement of trade and political ties with Washington, a $50 million per year fuel oil supply, and construction of two nuclear reactors valued at about $5 billion. Washington is working with about a dozen allies to raise money to support the deal, while Seoul has pledged to pick up most of the tab. In return, the North has agreed to freeze its current nuclear program and thus prevent the amassing of more weapons-grade plutonium.

<P>
<DD>
However, the Clinton Administration backed down on its earlier insistence that Pyongyang immediately allow for a full accounting of the plutonium it produced in the past. Inspection of its fuel storage sites, which the North is obliged to allow under other international treaty obligations, has been delayed for years to come. In the meantime, the North may be constructing nuclear bombs secretly with the enriched fuel it currently possesses. Even the Clinton Administration admits that the U.S. would have no way to detect such a covert program. The North is pleased with the Geneva deal since it offers lucrative benefits yet allows it to keep its nuclear card until just before projected completion of the reactors -- a process that, even under the best circumstances, will take years.

<P>
<DD>
Under the Agreed Framework, the North promised to engage in dialogue with the South and to make progress toward tension reduction. Since then, Pyongyang has refused to do so, and tensions on the Peninsula have risen. The North's million-man army maintains its forward deployment. North Korea has a growing missile arsenal which is capable of striking all parts of South Korea. Its large stockpiles of chemical weapons are also of grave concern to U.S. military commanders.

<P>
<B>Where Are the Sticks?</B>

<P>
<DD>
Seoul understandably was outraged by the bloody North Korean submarine incident last September, declaring that until Pyongyang clearly apologized and pledged to begin peace talks, it would refuse to cooperate with the U.S.-conceived plan to construct the expensive reactors for the North. Washington quickly convened a series of 11 bilateral talks with North Korean officials in an effort to keep its foreign policy "success" afloat.

<P>
<DD>
On December 29, Pyongyang issued a brief, ambiguous statement expressing "deep regret" over the incident that had "caused tragic loss of human life."  The statement was not addressed specifically to the South, however, and conspicuously failed to acknowledge North Korea's responsibility for the deaths. The next day, Seoul reacted by returning the remains of 24 North Korean commandos killed in the conflict; in response to this gesture, North Korea released an official statement calling Seoul "the enemy murderer" and adding that "we have taken back the bodies from the enemy after parleying with their masters [the U.S.]."  "This means that the South Korean authorities admitted and apologized for their inhuman crimes," Pyongyang declared. In other words, what Washington calls an acceptable apology was painted by the North as an indictment of Seoul's culpability.

<P>
<DD>
The Clinton Administration claims it also has achieved progress on talks between the North and South. Last April, the U.S. and South Korea proposed four-party talks involving Washington, Beijing, Seoul, and Pyongyang. North Korea has refused to accept the idea. Under international pressure in the wake of the submarine incident, Pyongyang has agreed to the Clinton Administration's request that it participate in a "briefing" on what the formal talks would be about; it has not said, however, that it would engage in the proposed formal dialogue. In fact, when South Korean President Kim Young Sam recently expressed hope that peace talks would convene, the North condemned him as a "traitor" incapable of promoting reconciliation.

<P>
<DD>This has every marking of a classic North Korean delay tactic. There are clear indications that the North's participation in a briefing will be followed by a reversion to its "no dialogue" stance. Yet the Clinton Administration is moving swiftly to reward Pyongyang's latest actions. America's economic embargo will be eased by allowing some U.S. companies to engage in barter trade with the North, and Administration sources say Washington will consider giving further U.S. humanitarian assistance to Pyongyang.

<P>
<B>The Future Course</B>

<P>
<DD>
To continue funding America's share of the Agreed Framework costs, the Clinton Administration will seek around $30 million from Congress this year. As legislators consider this request, they should examine the October 1996 General Accounting Office report on the Geneva deal. The GAO study, requested by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK), an experienced Asia policy hand, characterizes the Geneva deal as a "non-binding political agreement" that is not enforceable under either U.S. or international law. It further notes that, in contrast to a formal treaty, the deal is constructed so that the Administration is not required to seek congressional approval. Thus, the North Korean deal "can have the effect of pressuring the Congress to appropriate moneys to implement an agreement with which it had little involvement."  The phrase "no involvement" would be a more accurate characterization.

<P>
<DD>Current U.S. policy tolerates hostile and uncooperative North Korean behavior and does very little to pursue the most serious national security threats facing the U.S. in Korea. In this year's budget deliberations, Congress should press the Clinton Administration to deliver swiftly on its pledge -- made more than two years ago -- to achieve an unequivocal agreement by North Korea both to restart substantive and direct peace talks with the South and to make rapid progress toward reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

<title> Speaking for Hong Kong-- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 563</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and 
Educational Programs</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>
<b>By The Rt. Hon. Christopher Patten</b></p> 
<p>
Given May 7, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong is very fortunate to have so many friends and well-wishers in the United States. Over the next 14 months and beyond, Hong Kong is going to need its friends in the United States and elsewhere. Hong Kong needs the understanding and the support of the United States as it progresses through the most testing period of its history, the final months before July 1, 1997, and the transfer of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China. I have come to Washington this week to talk to our friends about an issue which is crucial to Hong Kong's ongoing economic and social success. As you all know, I have come to Washington to put Hong Kong's case--let me repeat that--Hong Kong's case for the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I want to make this point absolutely clear right at the start. I have not traveled to Washington to speak on behalf of the People's Republic of China. It is not for me to put China's case for the renewal of MFN status. Nor is it for me to defend China's record on human rights, on arms proliferation, or its trade practices. These are matters which Chinese officials must address, not the Governor of Hong Kong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not saying that Hong Kong has no view on these issues. On the contrary, Hong Kong has very strong opinions about human rights and about free and fair trade. Our record as a pluralist society based on the rule of law and our record as probably the most open economy in the world tells you all you need to know about where we stand on these issues. My task today and during the rest of my visit to the United States is to speak for Hong Kong, to put, as I have said, Hong Kong's case for MFN renewal, and I shall do so with all the force that I can command.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I shall be putting two arguments to everyone I meet. The first is an argument for the preservation of a fundamental trade principle. The second is an argument for the preservation of jobs and livelihoods in Hong Kong. Let me start with principles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Round about the turn of the last century, the Patten family, my forbears, decided it had a principled position on the pressing issue of poverty. They did not like it, so they left Ireland and set off for Manchester. Now Manchester, during the last century, was the epicenter of a free trade earthquake which shook protectionism everywhere. Manchester was so committed, some might say obsessed, with free trade as a political issue that it named its principal place of public assembly the Free Trade Hall. This is the only example that I know where a city named one of its public buildings for a proposition from economic theory. That is, of course, unless I missed the opening of the Milton Friedman "Tight Money" concert hall in Chicago recently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Manchester won the free trade argument, and, as a result, the first great free trade revolution occurred after 1846 under British leadership. During the following 30 years, international trade increased by more than 300 percent. History repeated itself and the second great revolution in free trade occurred exactly a century later. This revolution took place under American leadership and started in 1946. Again, the value of international trade increased by more than 300 percent in the following 30 years. It was the United States which made this 20th century expansion of trade and prosperity possible. The United States provided the world with unstinting aid directly and through almost every multilateral organization. The United States also provided resources and incentives to emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere and kept its huge market open to the export products of these economies. At the same time, American business invested enormous amounts of capital in the reconstruction of Europe and Japan and in developing economics everywhere, but particularly in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic, social, and political consequences of this American free trade leadership have been profound. You need look no further than Hong Kong to understand what it has meant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has enjoyed 35 years of unbroken economic growth. During this time, our per capita GDP has increased by 530 percent so that we are now on a par with Canada and much of Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has put its growing prosperity to good use. We provide tertiary education places for 24 percent of each generation of students--up from about 3 percent 10 years ago. Our health care standards are now fast approaching the standards of Western Europe and North America--and some of our health indicators are actually better. We have invested in our people and invested heavily in our infrastructure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, hard work and a high savings ratio have been important. But it was free trade-- access to the United States market in the post-war years--which gave Hong Kong, and many of our neighbors in Asia, their big break. Without the liberal trading environment created under the GATT and now continuing under the World Trade Organization, there would have been no German, Japanese or, more recently, Southeast Asian economic miracles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has been true of the past 50 years will, I think, be true of the next 50 years. American leadership will be as vital in maintaining the momentum of free trade during the first half of the 21st century as it has been during the second half of the 20th century. And a crucial test of this leadership is the one which most concerns Hong Kong. The issue can be simply stated: Can the United States and China establish and maintain a normal trading relationship?  I say normal trading relationship because, of course, MFN status is the international norm. The alternative is an abnormal trading relationship between the United States and China, and that, it seems, would be in no one's interests, certainly not Hong Kong's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me make Hong Kong's position absolutely clear. We are not suggesting that the United States, or any other country which shares your and our values, should soft-pedal on the other major issues in the relationship with China. Human rights are at least as important as trade relations. Nor can there be any higher priority for all of us than controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nor can there be any doubt that trade practices must be fair or that intellectual property rights must be protected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But I believe that MFN should be used as a key to achieve progress on all of these issues, not as a weapon. MFN status should be allowed its opportunity to facilitate progress on all of these issues. By contrast, I believe, withdrawal of MFN status would hinder, rather than promote, such progress. The policy of engagement adopted by the United States seems to me, and seems to the community for which I speak, to be the only policy which offers the possibility of making progress on the full range of issues in the U.S.-China relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I said earlier that I wanted to preserve a principle and that I wanted to preserve Hong Kong jobs. This second argument for renewing China's MFN status is, to put it bluntly, a matter of special pleading. Hong Kong is now so closely integrated with the Chinese economy that anything which damages the relationship between the United States and China, our two largest trading partners, is certain to injure us. Specifically, if MFN is not renewed, Hong Kong stands to lose about 90,000 jobs and up to half of our forecast annual growth in GDP. I recognize that Hong Kong's economy is flexible and that we would recover from such a blow in time. But the blow would fall at a particularly difficult time for Hong Kong. It would come just as we are about to start the final year of the transition to Chinese sovereignty, at a time when Hong Kong is particularly vulnerable to shocks to confidence in its future and we can least afford a setback to our economic fortunes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There might be people here today who wish Hong Kong well on MFN, people who are concerned to give Hong Kong the best possible chance of making a success of its future as a Special Administrative Region of China, people who think that putting conditions on the renewal of China's MFN would in some way help Hong Kong to achieve this. I want to say to you in the clearest possible terms: Thanks, but no thanks. I am not aware of any community leader in Hong Kong who advocates anything other than renewal of China's MFN without conditions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The message I bring from Hong Kong on MFN is this: If you want to help Hong Kong, please listen to what we are saying on this crucial issue and saying unanimously. To any of our friends and supporters in Washington or elsewhere who are tempted by the idea of MFN conditions, I say to you on behalf of the whole community in Hong Kong that you will not help us by damaging our economy and damaging confidence in our future. The best way to help us is by renewing MFN and by continuing the policy of engagement towards China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have not pointed and will not be pointing to the economic consequences for the United States of any deterioration in the trade relationship with China as a result of not renewing MFN or of attaching conditions. This is a matter for Americans, not for the Governor of Hong Kong. I will make only one tangential observation and leave it at that. I am no economist, and I do not claim to be an expert on the theory of comparative advantage and free trade. But I hope that I have got the basics right, perhaps because my family absorbed some of Manchester's free trade zeal, or perhaps just because I read Adam Smith. And the basics are that free trade is beneficial to those who practice it regardless of what others do. If I may paraphrase a 19th century French economist, to argue that the United States should be protectionist because other countries do not practice free trade is like saying that you should block up your harbors because other countries have rocky coasts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas Jefferson once said that no country was ever ruined by trade. He was right, but quite a few countries have been damaged by protectionism. The essential point I want to leave you with today, ladies and gentlemen, is that Hong Kong has lived and prospered by free trade. Please do not do anything to jeopardize Hong Kong's trade, Hong Kong's prosperity, or Hong Kong's future.

<title>Warning to North Korea: Stop Provocations and Talk Peace With South Korea - Heritage</title>

<h3>WARNING TO NORTH KOREA: STOP PROVOCATIONS AND TALK PEACE WITH SOUTH KOREA</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 273<br>
April 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
(Updating <I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 236, "Clinton's Korea Policy Falls Short: A Call to Congressional Action," January 13, 1995, and Asian Studies Center <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 133, "The Clinton Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End Street?," November 4, 1994.)
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On three different occasions this past week, communist North Korea sent armed troops into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the border separating the North from South Korea. These provocative moves directly violate the 1953 Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the Korean War. They also raise questions about North Korea's intentions. At risk is not only the security of America's ally, the Republic of Korea, but the safety and security of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. These hostile steps come at a time when the Clinton Administration continues its flawed policy of providing economic benefits to North Korea and improving political relations with its government in the absence of any improvement in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Bill Clinton will visit South Korea on April 16. He will be stopping over on his way to the Japan summit to meet briefly with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. While on Cheju Island, off the peninsula's southwestern tip, President Clinton, in close coordination with President Kim, should make it clear to Pyongyang that unless North Korea takes immediate steps to reduce tensions, the U.S. will curtail its current policy of upgrading U.S.-North Korean relations and bolstering the North's failing economy.
<p>
<b>Pyongyang Attacks the Armistice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

North Korea's recent military moves are a direct attack on the 1953 United Nations-brokered Armistice Agreement that ended hostilities of the Korean War. The Armistice established a Military Armistice Commission (MAC) to maintain the cease-fire, serve as a military channel of communication, and investigate violations of the Armistice. The MAC, too, is sanctioned by the United Nations. The Armistice also established the existing DMZ and the Joint Security Area (JSA) which straddles the border. The JSA is a small, circular compound where the MAC meetings and occasional North-South negotiations have taken place over the years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has taken steps to undermine the functions of the MAC. It refuses to attend scheduled MAC meetings, thus closing the only channel for military communication along the world's most heavily armed border. On April 4, Pyongyang declared that it "shall give up its duty, under the armistice agreement, concerning the maintenance and control of the military demarcation line and the DMZ."  The next day, several hundred heavily armed North Korean soldiers entered the North's side of the JSA and carried out what appeared to be combat training drills. Similar incursions took place on April 6 and 7. These actions are serious violations of the Armistice agreement. Each side is limited to only 35 troops in its sector. Another violation occurred when on April 7 North Korean troops carried rifles, machine guns, and mortars into the Joint Security Area. Soldiers in the JSA are restricted to sidearms only.
<P>
<b>The North's Quest for a Peace Treaty with the U.S.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Pyongyang openly admits that this deliberate destruction of the existing Armistice structure is aimed at a long-standing goal: convincing the U.S. to sign a bilateral peace treaty with the North. Pyongyang hopes that such a treaty would cut Seoul out of the military settlement and pave the way for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. The Clinton Administration rightly insists that the U.S. will never sign such a deal. Since the U.S. fought in the Korean War under the U.N. banner, it should not be attempting to negotiate with North Korea on its own. The only sensible replacement of the existing structure is a peace treaty negotiated and signed by North and South Korean governments.
<p>
<b>U.S. Flexibility Encourages North Korean Belligerence</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has chosen this bold and provocative course of action because the Clinton Administration's Korea policy is weak and misguided. The foundation of Clinton's policy is the "Agreed Framework" of October 1994. Negotiated in an effort to stop the North's menacing nuclear weapons program, the Framework offered certain benefits to the North, including gradual improvement of trade and political ties with Washington, a $50 million-per-year fuel oil supply, and the construction of two nuclear reactors in the North worth about $5 billion. Washington is working with about a dozen allies to raise money to support the deal, but Seoul has pledged to pick up most of the tab. In return, the North agreed to freeze its current nuclear program, thus preventing it from amassing any more weapons-grade plutonium. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, the Clinton Administration backed down on its earlier insistence that Pyongyang immediately provide a full accounting of the plutonium it has produced. Inspection of its fuel storage sites, which the North is obligated to permit under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has been delayed for years to come. In the meantime, the North may be constructing nuclear bombs secretly with the enriched fuel it currently possesses. Even the Clinton Administration admits that the U.S. has no way of detecting such a covert program. The North was pleased with the deal since it offers lucrative benefits yet allows it to keep its nuclear card. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under the Agreed Framework, the North also promised to engage in dialogue with the South and make progress toward tension reduction. But Pyongyang has refused to do this. In fact, as the events of recent days indicate, tensions are as high as ever. The North's million-man army maintains its forward deployment. Its large stockpiles of chemical weapons are of grave concern to U.S. military commanders. The North has a growing missile arsenal which is capable of striking all parts of South Korea.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Agenda While in South Korea</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's Korea policies have failed to protect America's interests on the Korean Peninsula: the reduction of military tension along the DMZ. The North's recent provocations are disturbing evidence not only of its contempt for the Armistice, but for Clinton's Framework agreement as well. While in South Korea on April 16, President Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Express strong U.S. condemnation of the North's actions and reiterate Washington's commitment to the defense of South Korea.</b> The U.S. should bolster U.S. forces in South Korea with AWACS radar aircraft and temporarily deploy one more aircraft carrier to the 7th fleet in the Pacific. These additional forces are necessary to deter the North from undertaking real aggression against the South.
<p>
<li><b>Clearly state that the U.S. will never consider a bilateral peace treaty with the North.</b> President Clinton should remind the North that, in the Reconciliation Agreement ratified by the North and South in 1992, the two sides pledged to negotiate a North-South peace agreement. Clinton should demand that the North abide by this commitment.
<p>
<li><b>
Press Pyongyang for immediate initiation of substantive, high-level talks with Seoul.</b> The 1992 North-South Reconciliation Agreement is a detailed document outlining practical steps toward easing political and military tensions between the two sides and could serve as a blueprint for future dialogue. The North has refused to implement this agreement and instead has focused its efforts on improving its ties with the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>
Remind Pyongyang that the U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord explicitly links tension reduction with the political and economic benefits offered to the North.</b> President Clinton should warn Pyongyang that if it continues to violate both the spirit and letter of the Framework, it will put at risk further implementation of the Framework agreement.
<p>
<li><b>
Discuss with Seoul the appointment of a seasoned American negotiator as a special envoy to jump-start the tension reduction process.</b> A special envoy could seek regular contacts at the highest levels of Pyongyang's secretive and insular ruling elite. He could make clear to the North that the U.S. and South Korea will no longer tolerate the North's provocations. If this message is not hammered home to Pyongyang forcefully and regularly, the North will continue to underestimate America's resolve and misjudge its intentions.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now that the Cold War is over, Pyongyang no longer has China and the Soviet Union standing in the wings prepared to back its military aggression. Nevertheless, apparently oblivious to this fact, North Korea is threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. needs to act now to send North Korea a message: stop the military provocation, live up to its agreements, and start talking peace with Seoul.

<title>Bill Clinton and Japan: Getting the Record Straight - Heritage</title>

<h3>BILL CLINTON AND JAPAN: GETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT</h3>

F.Y.I. 95<br>
April 11, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will visit Japan on April 16-18 to meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The major purpose of his trip will be to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance. Challenges now facing both the United States and Japan in Asia, from tensions on the Korean Peninsula to China's increasingly aggressive conduct toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, make a reaffirmation both timely and necessary. It is even more necessary because for the better part of the Administration's first two years, Bill Clinton's Japan policy has put this critical relationship at risk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration came into office committed to forging a new U.S.-Japan relationship. Its Japan policy, however, was based on a number of miscalculations. The first was that security issues could be de-emphasized in the U.S.-Japan relationship after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was the over-emphasis placed on reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Trade policy, originally viewed as but one part of an overall Japan strategy, quickly expanded in time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Administration's approach to Japan. In effect, Japan policy became an extension of the 1992 campaign theme, "Its the economy, Stupid."  Seeing Japan through a mid-1980s time warp as an immutable economic juggernaut, the Clinton team was committed to applying intense external pressure to get its way. The final miscalculation was that, in the post-Cold War world, this pressure could be applied with little collateral political damage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, the Administration was wrong across the board. Security in today's post-Soviet world remains important, as North Korea's quest for nuclear weaponry and China's aggressive behavior toward Taiwan have reminded Americans and Japanese alike. Moreover, Japan's economy was not immutable. By 1993, it was undergoing significant structural change, the result of a five-year recession brought on by the collapse of its wildly inflated late-1980s economy and a skyrocketing appreciation of its currency, the yen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While in Tokyo, President Clinton will try to take credit not only for improved U.S.-Japan economic relations -- in particular, the reduction of America's trade deficit with Japan -- but for the improving security relationship as well. This will be credit not deserved. After damaging U.S.-Japan relations with the threat of a trade war, the President saw his mistake and corrected course. Better late than never. But solving a problem which the President himself caused is hardly the best way to conduct foreign policy.
<p>
<b>ECONOMICS IN COMMAND</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration got off on the wrong foot early in dealing with the Japanese. Downplaying the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance, the Administration quickly placed economics and trade at the top of its agenda with Tokyo. The centerpiece of its strategy was its New Economic Framework, a combination of economic and trade policies hastily cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993. In effect, the New Economic Framework was an attempt to manage trade with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Through a series of negotiators the Clinton Administration attempted to pressure the Japanese government into accepting targets for American exports to Japan. The Framework negotiations essentially were geared to redeeming the President's promise to produce results in such politically sensitive sectors as computers, telecommunications, automobiles, and auto parts. Fearing that failure to meet such quotas would make Japan a target for trade sanctions, Tokyo refused to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

From the outset, the Framework talks were acrimonious, marked by a high degree of suspicion, mistrust, and unprecedented personal animosity. They did not improve with age. At the February 1994 summit between Bill Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese found that they could and did say "no" to the Administration's demands for managed trade. By the spring of 1995, the Administration was poised for a trade war with Japan, threatening a 100 percent tariff on the import of Japanese luxury automobiles unless Tokyo relented and signed up for managed trade.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In both countries, the media duly reported on and expanded on the tactics and personalities of the negotiators and their countries. In both countries, the media retreated to familiar stereotypes -- the untrustworthy, scheming Japanese versus the unreasonable, demanding Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the end, trade agreements were signed but none contained enforceable quotas. Typical was the conclusion of the auto parts negotiations. Two days after insisting that the government of Japan had to be part of an agreement to guarantee compliance of Japanese auto companies, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to back down. To underscore the extent of the Administration's retreat, the Japanese negotiator, Ryutaro Hashimoto, now Japan's Prime Minister, made clear at a joint press conference that Kantor was speaking solely for himself with regard to expectations for growth in American exports to Japan. The Japanese government, he emphasized, was not guaranteeing the deal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton set out to build a new U.S.-Japan relationship. But by placing economics at the center of his Japan policy, he short-changed the vital U.S.-Japan security relationship. And by resorting to threats of a trade war, the President caused a significant erosion in Japanese support for relations with the U.S. In short, his policies have been counterproductive for the strategic interests of the U.S.
<p>
<b>ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS AND JAPAN'S ECONOMIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration is claiming that its trade policies are responsible for the recent decline in Japan's trade surplus with the United States. This is political spin of the highest order and represents a striking example of the logical fallacy known as <I>post hoc ergo propter hoc</I> (literally, "after this, therefore because of this"). The root causes for this decline are to be found not in Washington, but in the impact of global economic forces operating on Japan. In reality, a substantial appreciation of the yen and high Japanese production costs are the main causes of America's declining trade deficit with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The major factor driving down Japan's trade surplus is the soaring value of the yen. In Japan, this is known as <I>endaka</I>, which means an increase in the value of the yen against other currencies. From 158 yen = $1 in April 1990, the yen appreciated to a high of 79 yen = $1 in April 1995. Today, it stands at approximately 108 yen = $1, still substantially higher than it was in 1990. The appreciation of the yen has had a double effect: While making Japanese exports more expensive, it also has made imports cheaper. And Japanese consumers have responded to market signals by buying more imports, including those from the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Imports began to surge in April 1993. Japan's imports climbed by 22.3 percent in 1995. Semiconductors and electronic devices went up 66.6 percent, while automobile imports grew by 40.6 percent. Meanwhile, internationally, Japan's now higher-priced exports grew more slowly, by 12.0 percent, while exports of American-bound automobiles actually fell by 13.9 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <I>endaka</I> also is causing Japanese manufacturers to restructure fundamentally the way they do business. Under unrelenting pressure to cut costs, Japanese firms are beginning to open their traditional clubby business networks, known as <I>keiretsu</I>, to foreign suppliers. American and other foreign venders are now aggressively marketing their components to Japanese firms.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, Delphi, a General Motors parts subsidiary, hired Nissan and Toyota executives who then persuaded their former employers to designate Delco batteries as "authorized" parts for automobiles made by these Japanese companies. Consequently, Nissan and Toyota dealers now stock Delco batteries. In another instance, Tenneco, a <I>Fortune</i> 500 corporation with interests in automotive parts, energy, packaging, and shipbuilding, recently reached agreements with Toyota and Japan Energy to carry U.S.-made Monroe and Rancho shock absorbers at Toyota's 5,000 affiliated garages and at Japan Energy's 6,000 gas stations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To stay competitive, Japanese manufacturing firms are closing plants in Japan and moving to lower-cost production sites in the United States, Britain, and Southeast Asia. For example, Toyota is now investing billions in new plants, not in Japan, but in the U.S., Britain, and Thailand. While shedding jobs in Japan, Fujitsu, a leading Japanese electronics manufacturer, is building semiconductor plants in Oregon and Britain. Increasingly, Japanese firms are supplying overseas markets through local production rather than exports. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) estimates that in 1995 the value of goods produced by Japanese companies overseas exceeded the value of their exports for the first time in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, "reverse imports" -- products made abroad by Japanese firms and then exported for sale to Japan -- are becoming common in America. For example, Honda is now a net exporter of motor vehicles to Japan. In 1995, Honda exported some 45,000 Accord coupe, Accord wagon, and Civic models from North America to Japan. In sum, cost-conscious Japanese corporate decisions, not U.S. government policy, are driving down Japan's trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By attempting to manage trade through quotas or targets, the Administration's trade policy was playing directly against economic forces that are working to transform, open, and deregulate Japan's economy. Trade quotas, both to expand imports and to restrain exports, empower the Japanese bureaucracy to decide which firms must buy more of a targeted import and which firms must be prevented from making profitable sales overseas. Such an expansion of governmental control would reregulate rather than deregulate Japan's economy.
<p>
<b>POLITICAL COSTS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's trade war with Japan from 1993-1994 took a political toll on the U.S.-Japan relationship. According to polls conducted by the United States Information Agency in June 1995, during the auto and auto parts negotiations, 39 percent of Japanese respondents saw trade conflicts as eroding the alliance, while 30 percent saw the alliance as strong. By contrast, in May 1992, 43 percent saw the alliance as strong despite trade frictions. In the same June 1995 poll, 51 percent considered relations as "poor" and only 41 percent viewed them as "good."  In January 1996, 48 percent thought the relationship in "poor" shape.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Certainly, progress needs to made in opening and deregulating Japan's market. But, as the above polls make clear, the Administration's approach of using external pressure to force internal economic change in Japan has been counterproductive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Against this background, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen last September triggered the most serious crisis in the U.S.-Japan security relationship in decades. Calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Okinawa dominated Japan's political public debate in October. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 With the Okinawa crisis still smoldering, the President did not help matters when he canceled his November state visit to Japan to deal with the budget battle in Washington. Shortly before that decision, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, warned that cancellation would be a "body blow" to the alliance. In Tokyo, Japanese government officials noted that the cancellation was met with a dangerous indifference by the Japanese media and public, reflecting exasperation in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Shortly thereafter, the President in similar circumstances found time to visit Ireland and Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin. The Japanese media and political elite were quick to contrast the President's political priorities.
<p>
<b>ENDURING STRATEGIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the end of the Cold War, the alliance with Japan remains critical to American national interests. Today, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is the centerpiece of Asia's security system and the foundation of its economic dynamism and prosperity. This is of direct and immediate consequence to the security and economic well-being of all Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As John Dori of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center has pointed out, U.S. exports to Asia in 1994 grew at a rate of 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion, the steepest increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the region purchased over $45 billion more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 million more than Europe as a whole. And exports to Asia mean jobs for Americans. In 1994 more than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to exports to Asia, with 428,000 jobs being created in 1994 alone.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The United States also has enduring strategic interests in Asia. For over a century, the U.S. has worked to prevent a single power from dominating the region. Today, America's alliance with Japan enhances its ability to keep Asia open to U.S. influence. Forward-deployed U.S. forces in Japan have helped to deter aggression against allies and friends in the region. Recognizing the importance of this U.S. presence to Japan's security, the government of Japan contributes close to $5 billion annually in support for U.S. forces stationed in that country. Japan's effort in this regard represents the most generous host nation support of any of America's allies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The strategic importance of the U.S. force presence in Japan was recently demonstrated. In mid-March, President Clinton ordered the deployment of the USS <I>Independence</I>, home-ported in Yokosuka, Japan, to waters near Taiwan at the time of the Republic of China's presidential elections. This strategic importance has also been evidenced by America's continuing ability to deter a possibly nuclear-armed North Korea from attacking South Korea, a U.S. ally, and reunifying the Korean Peninsula on communist terms. And a strong U.S.-Japan alliance will enhance America's ability to deal with China as it emerges as a great power in the first quarter of the next century.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton's Japan policy has ill served the relationship once defined by Ambassador Mike Mansfield as the United States' most important "bar none."  Were it not for the dedicated work of officials in the Pentagon, most notably Joseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, there is no telling how far the free-fall in the relationship would have taken the alliance. Fortunately, these officials recognized the damage being done by the Administration's trade tactics, and in 1994 began the long, arduous task of returning the Administration's focus to the strategic centrality of the alliance. This is what has brought Bill Clinton to Tokyo. Better late than never.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<p>(3) Push for more open, less regulated markets for U.S. goods and services; </p>
<p/>
(4) Show the nations in the region that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and multilateral agreements by punishing those who transgress; and </p>
<p>
(5) Strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market share.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have been patient with me, and I thank you most sincerely for the opportunity to share some views with you this evening. I am genuinely honored to be in the company of the high caliber of Asia and foreign policy specialists in this room tonight, and I hope I will have the benefit of your views later in the evening.

<h3>The Rule of Law In Hong Kong In the Run-Up to 1997 and Beyond</h3>

By Daniel R. Fung, Q.C., J.P.<br>
January 30, 1996
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is a rare privilege and a real pleasure for me personally to be asked to address you today. I am honored to see before me a galaxy of experts not just on Hong Kong and China issues specifically, but also on East Asian affairs in general. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
May I begin by briefly outlining the duties and powers of my present office. Next I shall proceed to canvass what we as a government have done to entrench the rule of law in Hong Kong, after which I will talk about the inculcation in our community of legal culture and human rights values. Finally, I will address the question foremost on everyone's minds and offer a prognosis as to whether the foregoing legal and cultural construct will survive the transition to Chinese sovereignty. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The office of Solicitor General for Hong Kong differs substantially from that of my counterpart in the United States federal government. While your Solicitor General acts as the government's principal advocate responsible for determining which issues warrant determination in the United States Supreme Court and the federal Appeals Courts, my portfolio covers the Hong Kong government's legal policy. In the context of the run-up to 1997 and beyond, my brief is to ensure that Hong Kong's legal system remains true to the spirit of the common law before as well as after the reversion to Chinese sovereignty. I carry also a number of sub-portfolios, including the legal protection of human rights, constitutional and electoral law, the law of the People's Republic of China (in terms of advising my government on PRC law as well as monitoring its growth and development), and, finally, law reform in Hong Kong.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COMMON LAW HERITAGE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The common law is arguably Britain's greatest and proudest legacy bequeathed to Hong Kong. We are poised to emerge from just over a century-and-a-half of British rule. As a direct result, we enjoy a legal system which is based on the doctrine of case precedent, or <I>stare decisis</I>. The way the common law operates is illustrated in the immortal words of one legal commentator who observed that it "stands as a monument slowly raised, like a coral reef, from the minute accretions of past individuals, of whom each built upon the relics which his predecessors left, and in turn left a foundation upon which his successors might work." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The growth and development of the common law depends on input from and cross-fertilization with other common law jurisdictions. No common law system can, by definition, survive in a vacuum. Accordingly, we cite in our courts on a regular, if not actually daily, basis decisions not merely of our own jurisdiction, but also those of the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand, the Supreme Court of Canada, and last, but by no means least, the United States Supreme Court and the United States Appeals Courts, to pick but a few prominent examples from the extensive reach of the common law patrimony. The continuation of this system is guaranteed both by international treaty (the Sino-British Joint Declaration) and by constitutional provisions (the Basic Law), which form the twin cornerstones of our future legal edifice. Hong Kong will remain locked into the international grid as a member of the common law family, wherefore, after 1997, we will continue to cite in our courts in appropriate cases the decisions of your superior courts.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The provisions girding our future have been erected and can be viewed structurally at a number of different levels, at the international legal or treaty level as well as at the domestic constitutional level. Before we embark on this survey, we should remind ourselves that Hong Kong's transition towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty has been an extremely long one. Our odyssey began over 12 years ago, at the end of 1984, when the treaty known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed between the outgoing and the incoming sovereign powers. It will be complete on June 30, 1997. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have entered the last 500 days of this long journey. We have reached, in other words, the home stretch of our unique thirteen-and-a-half year marathon. Such a long transition holds certain advantages. It allows us periodically to pause and take stock of our progress, to look back over the long road down which we have travelled. And when we undertake this retrospective, we see four major milestones which mark, like rites of passage, our oftimes arduous trek towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. These milestones can be represented temporally by the years 1984, 1990, 1991 and 1995.
<p>
<b>THE SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our story begins in 1984. In that annus mirabilis, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom, following two years of hard negotiations inaugurated in 1982 by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Beijing, entered into a solemn agreement known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration (the Joint Declaration). The Joint Declaration is a bilateral treaty enforceable under international law and registered with the United Nations. It binds the outgoing sovereign, Britain, on the one hand into transferring sovereignty over Hong Kong to China, subject to certain specified conditions and safeguards, and the incoming sovereign, China, on the other, upon resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, into giving her people "a high degree autonomy" under Deng Xiaoping's famous twin dicta "One Country,Two Systems" and "Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Save only in respect of defense and foreign affairs, Hong Kong after 1997 will be designated a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China and be self-governing. In short, it will be self-governing at least to the same extent as it is self-governing today. As I shall endeavor to demonstrate later, in certain specific areas, Hong Kong will actually enjoy a degree of autonomy after 1997 even higher than that which it enjoys today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will maintain her present freedoms and lifestyle as well as her own political, economic, social, cultural, legal, and judicial systems fundamentally different and separate from those of the rest of China. Capitalism will continue to be practiced as the order of the day. Socialism as state policy will not be applied. We will maintain our own currency, the Hong Kong dollar: a hard currency, freely convertible, a tool of international trade, different from the <I>renminbi</I>, pegged to the U.S. dollar, and backed up by US$49 billion of reserves. Hong Kong will remain a separate customs territory. We will remain a separate fiscal area and a tax haven. No taxes will be remitted to the Central People's Government. We will practice fiscal conservatism and expend strictly within the limits of our revenue income. We will keep our own shipping and aircraft registers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong will maintain its own international persona separate from the rest of China. For example, we are a founder-member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). China is not. Hong Kong will retain its status in the WTO post-1997, whether or not China becomes a member of that body. We are a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC), sitting alongside China in that forum. After 1997, we will retain our seat on APEC. We will continue to participate at international activities and conferences under a new name, Hong Kong China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last but not least, the Joint Declaration specifically provides for our existing legal system to survive unchanged. In particular, it provides for the common law to continue to be applied. Hong Kong will maintain her own legal system based on the common law, which will be quarantined from that of the rest of China. PRC laws will not be applied in Hong Kong. We will have our own self-contained judicial system with the ability to exercise, for the first time in our history, power of final adjudication. Our very own Court of Final Appeal will be established in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, to replace the Privy Council in London as the ultimate arbiter of disputes within the Special Administrative Region. No PRC court will occupy such a position. There will be no overarching supreme court established to oversee the operations of the Court of Final Appeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications of the Joint Declaration are far-reaching. It adumbrates the beginnings of an experiment by the PRC with a form of government that has gone way beyond the federal model. No federal state of which I am aware would tolerate a similar degree of separateness or autonomy on the part of any one region within the same country.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Joint Declaration is striking in yet another respect: It contains an annex. By Annex I to the Joint Declaration, a document longer than the Joint Declaration itself but which forms part and parcel of the treaty and is also registered with the United Nations, the People's Republic of China commits to writing its basic policies governing Hong Kong after 1997. It fleshes out the provisions of the Joint Declaration proper and reiterates, among other matters, the separateness of Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems from those of the mainland and the continued application of the common law to Hong Kong with all that that implies. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Part XIII of Annex I, the People's Republic of China made plain that the provisions of the two principal international human rights covenants sponsored by the United Nations -- namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) -- which have been applied to Hong Kong since 1976 will continue to be applied to Hong Kong post-1997. And that is not all. In the context of fundamental common law doctrine that international legal and treaty rights and obligations do not automatically become justifiable domestically, China also made plain that those international legal provisions will be enforceable domestically in Hong Kong through Hong Kong law. And this is so despite the fact that China is not yet a signatory to either multilateral treaty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the Joint Declaration is remarkable in yet another respect: It obliges the People's Republic of China to reduce its stated policies and treaty obligations to an enforceable domestic form. In other words, it obliges China to enact a future mini-constitution for Hong Kong. This has now become a reality. The Joint Declaration was signed in December 1984, and was ratified by the U.K. Parliament in May 1985. In mid-1985, an unprecedented process of drafting the Basic Law in consultation with the people of Hong Kong commenced and lasted for five years until April of 1990, when the process was complete and the Basic Law promulgated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an unprecedented exercise in both the Chinese and Hong Kong context. Unprecedented in the Chinese context since they have never before drafted a constitution for a particular region about to be incorporated into the country. Unprecedented in the Hong Kong context because we have never before possessed a comprehensive written constitution: Our closest present equivalent to a written constitution are the Letters Patent, cast in general terms, which constitute instructions from Her Majesty the Queen to the Governor. Unprecedented also by reason of the open manner in which the exercise was carried out: It embraced people from all walks of life, both expert and non-expert, lawyers as well as laymen. The process was carried out by two committees -- the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Basic Law Consultative Committee. The Basic Law Consultative Committee comprised exclusively Hong Kong persons; the Basic Law Drafting Committee comprised partly mainland and partly Hong Kong members. Wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar (as I then was), I participated in that process as a member of the Consultative Committee.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong's Future Mini-Constitution: The Basic Law. As a result of that exercise, a 160-article mini-constitution was promulgated in April 1990. Article 8 of the Basic Law makes it plain that the pre-existing legal system -- that is to say, the common law, rules of equity, pre-existing legislation, subsidiary legislation, customary law -- will all be preserved post-1997, save only for those which contravene the mini-constitution. In Chapter 3 of the Basic Law, 19 articles are set out, and they lay down specific and discrete guarantees of human rights protections in specific areas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One article among the 19 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It is more pregnant with meaning than the rest. That is Article 39. It provides that the provisions of the two international human rights covenants, the ICCPR and ICESCR, will continue to apply to Hong Kong through the laws of Hong Kong. The Basic Law realizes the promises and guarantees made in the Joint Declaration at the domestic level. It will be enforceable as law interpreted by our courts, and challenges can be made in accordance with our system of common law challenges.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S BILL OF RIGHTS </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third milestone along the road to Chinese sovereignty is 1991. In 1991, we enacted for the first time a bill of rights. Those of you who are familiar with British constitutional history and development will appreciate that written constitutions and written bills of rights were and, to a certain extent, still are regarded as anathema by traditionalists in the United Kingdom. That attitude stems historically from the fact that England, as the <I>fons et origo</I> of the common law, considered the system of practices, conventions, and case law constituting the common law to be so ingrained and entrenched in their psyche and culture that there was no need for that body of jurisprudence to be reduced to a comprehensive written form. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the proposition was "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  This philosophy, if it ever gained currency within metropolitan soil, translates less happily to dependent territories because it is supposed, with some justification, that the common law enjoys a degree of entrenchment and impregnation into the psyche of dependency communities altogether more shallow than that of the mother country. That is why one finds that, as dependent territories evolve away from the colonial mold to a state of either independence (the standard model) or subsumption under a different sovereignty (in the case of Hong Kong), they have invariably been given written constitutions with bills of rights incorporated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same approach was taken in Hong Kong's case when we as a government sponsored and enacted a bill of rights after a gestation period of four-and-a-half years which commenced in 1987. Again, wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar, I played a small role in that process. Hong Kong's Bill of Rights is unique in more senses than one. Unique since we have never had a bill of rights before. Unique also because we have replicated in our Bill almost verbatim the exact same provisions of the ICCPR. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of the 130-odd countries around the world which have acceded to the international covenant, we are unique in being the only place that has domesticated those provisions. Our continuing dialogue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee and other U.N. agencies dealing with human rights reveals that no other country or territory has ever done so. Being an international covenant, it is free of so-called Asian values. We have a unique, universalist, culturally bias-free Bill of Rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our Bill of Rights is interesting in another respect, inasmuch as we have lifted the provisions of the ICCPR and placed them in a common law context. Being a common law jurisdiction, we regularly interpret the provisions of our Bill of Rights and amplify, explain, interpolate, and extrapolate from those provisions so as to render the Bill a living body of jurisprudence instead of merely a piece of paper expressing platitudes. In the course of interpretation, we rely on decisions from other common law jurisdictions, including those I have previously mentioned such as the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the New Zealand Court of Appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Supreme Court of India. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, we have gone beyond the common law world. We have looked at the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as those of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, in coming to our own conclusions. Over the four-and-a-half years since the passage of the Bill of Rights, we have built up a sizeable corpus of jurisprudence which renders meaningful and real the provisions of the Bill. Our body of case law is home-grown, yet saturated with international learning. It is a unique synthesis of local and international common as well as non-common law jurisprudence. I have it on good authority that our experiment is looked upon with great interest by many other common law as well as non-common law jurisdictions around the world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before I leave this subject, it is important to bear in mind that our Bill of Rights dovetails neatly with both the international treaty, the Joint Declaration, and our future mini-constitutional law, the Basic Law. Bearing in mind that both the Joint Declaration and Article 39 of the Basic Law provide for the provisions of the international covenants being applied and enforceable through the laws of Hong Kong, our Bill of Rights realizes that promise. It has actually completed the task of domesticating those provisions. The Hong Kong Bill of Rights constitutes, in essence, a domestic amplification of the corresponding mini-constitutional and international treaty provisions.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COURT OF FINAL APPEAL STATUTE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year we passed the last milestone. 1995 was the date when the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance was enacted by a landslide vote of our legislature. It makes our judicial system complete and repatriates our court of last resort to Hong Kong in the form of the Court of Final Appeal, replacing the Privy Council in London. The significance of this development cannot be overestimated, because we have hitherto always had the Privy Council in London as our court of last resort. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Between 1982 and 1984, the solution to this particular conundrum was much debated in the course of Sino-British dialogue over the future of Hong Kong. One obvious and logical solution placed on the agenda was "mirror-imaging," which would require replacing the Privy Council in London with a Court of Final Appeal in Beijing after 1997. However, after two years of hard negotiations, the architects of the Joint Declaration -- both Britain and China -- are to be congratulated in arriving at a uniquely Hong Kong solution to a Hong Kong problem, which is to establish the Court of Final Appeal as a common law court physically located in Hong Kong as opposed to Beijing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Court of Final Appeal has five seats. Led by the Chief Justice, it comprises three other permanent appointees, with the fifth slot being filled on invitation, on an ambulatory and ad hoc basis, by invitees selected from one of two panels, a panel of local jurists and a panel of overseas jurists. Such invitation may be made as the nature of the case may require so that if, say, a maritime dispute were on the agenda, an Admiralty expert may be invited from London to assist the court. In terms of membership of the court, the overriding consideration is that all the members must be common lawyers. No PRC judge would be admitted. On the overseas panel, we expect to have eminent common law jurists from all over the world. I suppose if we should be lucky enough, we might have one or more justices, either serving or retired, of the U.S. Supreme Court sitting on that panel. We would almost certainly have members of the House of Lords, as well as Privy Councillors from the Antipodes, sitting on the overseas panel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as concerns the permanent appointees, there is no nationality requirement, save only for the Chief Justice, who must be a Hong Kong Chinese individual with no foreign nationality. The other three permanent appointees need not be Chinese nationals at all, and if the present composition of our Court of Appeal should offer any guide, I would anticipate the majority of the Court of Final Appeal judges to be non-nationals. Of all countries in the world, only China has allowed for such an open system. I know of no other jurisidiction that allows for non-resident aliens giving an input at the highest level of the judicial machinery. This would rightly reflect the reality of Hong Kong as an international, cosmopolitan city.
<p>

<b>HONG KONG - A CIVIL SOCIETY</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structural underpinnings of the rule of law in Hong Kong. However, as all of us are well aware, structural underpinnings are a necessary but by no means a sufficient element for guaranteeing the preservation of the rule of law or of a civil society in Hong Kong after 1997. We must probe further. One has to examine how the law operates in action. One has to look also at the culture of the relevant society. One has to inquire whether the population regards the rule of law as an invisible but indispensable aspect of their everyday lives in much the same way as people in the United States or the United Kingdom take the rule of law for granted. The question, in other words, is whether Hong Kong is a civil society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had that question been put to me in 1984 at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, I would have had to couch my answer with considerable reservations. The same question asked of me today would elicit a much more categorical, positive response. I suppose that, because we have a set transition of finite duration with a scheduled target date, it has the effect of concentrating the mind immensely: not unlike the old adage of a condemned man's mind being wonderfully concentrated upon being informed of his scheduled date of execution! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Back in 1984, we were fully aware that in 13 years' time, the resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong will take place, wherefore it was necessary to put our house in order. What has happened over the last 12 years is that, as a result of a process of public education which we as a government have sponsored, we have witnessed a sea change in the attitude of the people of Hong Kong towards the importance of the rule of law as an indispensable underpinning of a civil society. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Statistics on the numbers of writs issued, cases decided, or legal principles laid down by our courts tell, perhaps, a less eloquent story than an examination of our popular culture. Since the mid-1980s, we have enjoyed in Hong Kong a number of hugely successful television series as well as feature films, being homegrown equivalents to "L.A. Law."  These portray bewigged and begowned barristers cross-examining witnesses in court, solicitors taking instructions from lay clients: in short, the lives and loves of lawyers which constitute the very stuff of legal soap opera. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are not propaganda pieces produced by the government. And if we were to attempt anything of that ilk, they would not sell!  On the contrary, these are commercially viable programs and movies that have been devised to show the machinery of justice in action, breathing life into the related themes of justice pursued and justice denied. And if the man or woman in the street cannot readily identify with the issues explored on celluloid, then these ventures would surely flop. The fact that they have not done so but have, on the contrary, broken box office records speaks volumes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as human rights culture is concerned, we have also embarked since 1991 on an ambitious program whereby we supply, free of charge, to all secondary schools in Hong Kong human rights teaching kits which are used by the teachers to teach schoolchildren human rights in lay terms as part of their civic education curriculum. We have also produced video tapes and cartoon booklets on human rights. So successful has this been that the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, when they examined Hong Kong in 1994, paid us the ultimate compliment of pronouncing Hong Kong as having done more in propagating and educating its population on human rights than any other country or place that has acceded to the Covenant.
<p>
<b>SURVIVAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structures, the practices, the culture. Will all this survive the transition?  Will we still see the same dynamics at work post-1997?  This is the ultimate question to which I adverted at the outset. In advancing a cautiously optimistic prognosis, may I cite seven principal factors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Structural Underpinnings.</b> First of all, the existence of the structural underpinnings, being the foundations of our system, should not be underestimated. They are not meaningless pieces of paper. The treaty (the Joint Declaration) is registered with the United Nations. There exists also the mini-constitution (the Basic Law), which will become a living law because it will be part of a common law system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The System's Track Record Throughout the Transition.</b> The proof of the pudding lies, of course, in the eating of it, which leads onto my second factor, which is that our system works and has worked in Hong Kong and has been seen to work throughout the transition. We have been undergoing 12 consecutive years of transition to conclude in a reversion to Chinese sovereignty, and the process has been nothing if not traumatic. It would be disingenuous of me to pretend otherwise. And it would be surprising were that not the case, because we are dealing with real people, people with families and children who worry about their future as well as their children's future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, despite the unavoidable uncertainties, despite the worries and concerns, Hong Kong has not gone the way of, say, the former Yugoslavia. There is no bloodshed on our streets. On the contrary, we have not merely survived, we have flourished. So much so that for every single year since 1984, Hong Kong experienced real growth, in double-digit terms throughout the 1980s and in single-digits throughout the 1990s. And the only reason for the deceleration in real growth is that, as the economists tell us, we have now reached a stage of development whereby single-digit figures are something for which any developed economy would be grateful. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a standard of living which exceeds that of Britain, Sweden, and most Western European nations. We are the fourth-biggest trading power in the world after the European Union, the United States, and Japan. If European Union countries are to be split up into separate sovereign states, we then are the sixth-largest trading power in the world. We are the world's fourth-largest financial center after London, New York, and Tokyo. We have the world's largest container port. We are the premier services center in East Asia and the Western Pacific. None of the above would be the case if Hong Kong were not served by a viable, mature, efficient, and incorrupt legal and judicial system. Those facts stare China in the face.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Economic Integration with China.</b> The third factor is China's self-interest, based on Hong Kong and China's ever-closer economic integration. I am often asked the question what will happen in 1997. The answer is that 1997 will come as something of an anticlimax. This is because economically we are already integrated with China, so that 1997 will present itself as a date when the political forms catch up with the economic reality. China has enormous stakes in Hong Kong. We still account for 40 percent of China's hard currency earnings. We are by far China's biggest trading partner. Figures for the year ending September 1995 show trade between Hong Kong and China in the region of HK$731 billion, which is just under US$100 billion. We are also the largest single foreign investor in China. The capital value of our investments is US$66 billion. This dwarfs anything invested by the United States, Japan, or the European Union.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you were to trace Hong Kong's economic development from a light manufacturing center in the 1970s into a services center by the mid-1980s, you will see our curious metamorphosis into a post-industrial society. Although rising labor and housing costs rendered it no longer economic to manufacture in Hong Kong, we have paradoxically not lost our manufacturing base. We merely relocated our factories north of the border. In the Pearl River Delta area of Southern Guangdong Province alone, you will find 4,000 manufacturing concerns established with Hong Kong capital. Economists talk accordingly of Greater Hong Kong as a cohesive economic unit of 70 million people, which is about the size of West Germany before unification and larger than the present-day France. Little wonder, then, that we are able to maintain our position as the fourth-biggest trading power anywhere in the world. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China happens also to be the biggest single investor in Hong Kong. China has capital investments in Hong Kong valued at US$31 billion. Again, this dwarfs investment by any other country. Hong Kong's financial markets are a natural vehicle for the raising of capital by Chinese companies by the so-called H shares. Hong Kong's banking system which is the best in Asia is a natural haven for Chinese savings.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The point of this argument is that increasing economic integration between Hong Kong and China makes for a "soft landing" in 1997. Conversely, if Hong Kong and China's respective economies were not even on speaking terms with each other, then we may be in for rather a rude shock come 1997. German unification following the demolition of the Berlin Wall holds a salutary lesson. Germany today is paying the price for want of economic integration between the two territories during the period of division, and looks set to continue to pay such price for a generation to come. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Existentializing Hong Kong's Legal Values.</b> I have already canvassed the domestic existentializing of legal culture which led to the creation of a civil society in Hong Kong. Looking at the Hong Kong-China relationship, if one were to ask the question in 1984, at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, whether China truly understood what made Hong Kong tick and whether they appreciated the value of our system, only a dyed-in-the-wool optimist would give a positive response. Even if experts such as economists could glimpse at the argument, it was unlikely that party leaders could existentialize it in their everyday lives. In those days, contact between the mainland and Hong Kong was sparse at best. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, however, the psychological landscape has changed beyond recognition. The sons and daughters of the Party elite live and work in Hong Kong. They put their savings in our banks; they buy our stocks; they speculate on our financial markets; they drive our cars; they punt on our racetracks: They live the Hong Kong life and they enjoy it!  The degree of qualitative as well as quantitative understanding in China of Hong Kong's system and what makes it work has increased exponentially. Little wonder that in the Chinese blueprint, we are slated to become the Manhattan-cum-Switzerland for China post-1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Taiwan Factor.</b>Let us turn now to the Taiwan factor. I do not believe this consideration can ever be swept aside. It operates as a negative disincentive. By that, I mean that if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed smoothly, it does not mean that Taiwan will come running back to the Chinese fold. Beijing knows that; Taipei knows that; Hong Kong also knows that. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the three of us are also well aware that, if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed badly, if Hong Kong should stumble, then the chances for peaceful reunification between the mainland and Taiwan become eliminated entirely. And for all the saber-rattling that has been going on across the Taiwan Strait over the last four months, which I daresay will reach a climax by March this year to coincide with the Presidential election in Taiwan, I for one do not think that peaceful reunification is off the agenda for China. Jiang Zemin cannot afford to take it off the agenda, wherefore it is a factor which must be weighed in the balance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Dragon Wakes.</b> The sixth factor is the most far-reaching. China is a country that has undergone double digit real growth for the last ten consecutive years. In the southernmost provinces which abut Hong Kong such as Guangdong and Fujian, real growth for the last four years had been over 30 percent, which has hitherto been unheard of in recent human history. What this means is that the lives as well as expectations of a quarter of humanity have been transformed, together with the buildup of attendant pressures for economic liberalization and political reforms on the Central People's Government and the provincial authorities which have only partially been met. We are not able to grasp the full consequences of this change because we are much too close to the trees to see the wood. All we say with reasonable certainty is that the economic transformation of China is an event of significance to be compared to the coming of the Industrial Revolution in 19th century Europe.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Role as Interpreter and Mentor for China.</b> Hong Kong stands at the vortex of this radical metamorphosis. We do so as dictated by history and geography. Hong Kong acts not merely as the bankers for China's modernization and the engine for her economic growth; we form also the natural interface between China and the international community. Hong Kong is the obvious interpreter for China in her dealings with the outside world. We do not throw up the same sort of cultural and linguistic barriers which China encounters when dealing directly with the outside world. Conversely, the international community tends to encounter less pain when they deal with China via Hong Kong than if they were to deal with China directly. Those among you who engage in or advise on China trade know the story full well.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So we play this role of interpreter and mentor. What this means in the legal sphere is that China looks to us for guidance and for advice. Since about the mid-1980s, China has been fascinated by the common law. Why the common law?  Because China can appreciate it as the instrument for dispute resolution <I>par excellence</I>. The common law, with its doctrine of binding precedent, is able to project a degree of precision and predictability to dispute resolution which is absent from the continental system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since about 1987, at least three different law schools in China have been studying Hong Kong law as a specialty and translating our laws into Chinese. Why Hong Kong law?  Perhaps because Hong Kong law is the most user-friendly of the common law systems from the Chinese perspective. They can see it operate in the Hong Kong context. They can see its successes. They can measure its effectiveness. They encounter less of a cultural and linguisitic barrier when studying Hong Kong law than that of another common law system such as the American model. Last but not least, we happen conveniently to be the most politically acceptable member of the common law family since we will soon be part of the one sovereign state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have actually overtaken these mainland law schools in the translation of our laws into Chinese. We now draft all our present and future legislation bilingually, in Chinese and in English, with two teams working in tandem. The end-product we supply to our Chinese counterparts, principally the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, not because we are obliged to but in order to stimulate their interest and often at their request. We have supplied the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission with our bankruptcy law, our companies legislation, and other commercial legislation which they have consulted in drafting their own laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the regional level, the degree of influence we exercise is more striking. Let us consider, for example, Shenzhen, which is our immediate northern neighbor. Shenzhen is the first of the special economic zones established by China in 1979. At the time, Shenzhen was a sleepy border town with a string of paddy fields. It is now a bustling city of 3 million. Since 1992, Shenzhen has been given legislative autonomy. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means that Shenzhen can pass its own laws, different and separate from those of the rest of the country, through its own Shenzhen People's Congress. In the last three-and-a-half years, Shenzhen has enacted approximately 250 pieces of primary and subsidiary legislation, of which fully two-thirds are plagiarized from the Hong Kong statute books with our blessing and cooperation and without charge for copyright royalties!  They are highly appreciative of our efforts. The Standing Committee Shenzhen People's Congress has indicated to me, shortly before I commenced this speaking tour, that Shenzhen wants to achieve legal parity with Hong Kong, leading eventually to economic integration with us.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That aspiration constitutes, at the moment, little more than a pipedream. It is also moot whether such a scheme would be permissible under the Basic Law. However, the more important fact to bear in mind is that the common law is not, of course, just a collection of statutes. The common law is a living body of case law. It is also a set of practices and values. The common law partakes of a certain spirit, a certain philosophy, a certain approach which respects the principle of the independence of the judiciary, which respects the independence of the legal profession, and which demands a minimum degree of objectivity and professionalism. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Shenzhen government is interested in having their lawyers trained by the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, and we have commenced a dialogue on this issue. In the same manner, we have commenced a dialogue on training lawyers at the level of both the Central People's Government and provincial governments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We already administer a program of training young Chinese private sector lawyers, jointly with the Overseas Development Aid Office of the British Government, the British Council, the English bar, the English Law Society, and London University whereby 12 of the ablest young Chinese lawyers are selected every year and sent to be trained in England for ten months. They spend the first four months at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London University, where they are taught the rudiments of the English legal system and the use of legal English, whereafter they spend the next three months attached to leading solicitors' firms, followed by a further three months' attachment with barristers chambers in the Temple and Lincoln's Inn. At the end of their ten months' English experience, the trainees come to Hong Kong, where they spend their final two months working in the Hong Kong private sector milieu before returning to China. As result, we now have an expanding network of alumni spread throughout the country, which will serve us well after 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We also help in the training of Chinese judges, who constitute, of course, key players in the judicial system. It is common ground that, currently, the degree of professionalism of the Chinese judiciary leaves much to be desired. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has set up a Senior Judges Training Center. Every year, 120 judges are selected from all over the country, given a year's sabbatical, and sent in two batches of 60 each to, respectively, Peking University Law School and People's University Law School to undergo specialist training. Afterwards the trainees return to the various provinces and cities from whence they came. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are in the process of negotiating the incorporation of a common law component into that training program. We hope to bring these senior judges down to Hong Kong to undergo training, using funds to be made available in Hong Kong for that purpose. The Supreme People's Court has recently also set up a Senior Judges Educational Foundation, on which I have been asked to sit as one of the founding honorary directors. We hope through this foundation to enhance much-needed professionalism for Chinese judges.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What of the legal profession?  Under the common law or in any mature legal system, the legal profession practices independently of government. Currently, Chinese lawyers are licensed to practice by the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice indicates that they intend to privatize the Chinese bar within 18 months. That was their stated target date in August last year. We can reasonably expect the Chinese bar to be rendered independent of the government sometime before 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the national level, we see the development of another phenomenon: that is, the beginnings of a case law system in China. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has been publishing reports of their case decisions on an annual basis in four volumes. Volume One is administrative law;Volume Two, criminal law; Volume Three, civil law; and Volume Four, economic law. It would be risible, however, to pretend that by this means, China will shortly be joining the common law family, for these reports have no binding force as we understand that term to be within a common law context, although they are of high persuasive value. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications are nevertheless clear; namely, that China is travelling down a road not dissimilar to that taken by France and Germany not so long ago when they started publishing law reports of their superior courts. That took place as a result of the pressures of European economic integration. In the Chinese context, the spur to change has likewise been economic in origin; namely, the Chinese modernization program. Last year, the task of translating into English the China Law Reports was complete and published by Butterworths, the leading publisher of common law legal texts outside of the United States. We in the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, as well as I personally, have played a small role in this process of preparing the English edition, which will be published on an annual basis.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The foregoing are but illustrations of remarkable developments in China in which we play a role, often modest, at times crucial, but all of which will assist in the modernization of the country. Hong Kong stands in the vortex of this process of seminal change in the biggest country in the world. In coming to some sort of prognosis as to what will happen to Hong Kong and to China after 1997, one must weigh in the balance the various provisions we have made for continuation of the system, the economic reality in the case of the Hong Kong-China synergy, <I>realpolitik</I> in the case of China's relations with Taiwan and with the outside world -- in particular, the United States response to China's changing relationship with Taiwan -- and, last but by no means least, self-interest on the part of China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of the above will combine to shorten the odds on our system surviving, and not merely surviving <I>simpliciter</I>, but also influencing change within China itself. 1997 will present itself as a unique opportunity for engineering positive and constructive change in China for the benefit not just of China and Hong Kong, but also the entire Asia-Pacific Region and, by extension, the rest of the world. This will come about as a natural development, since after 1997 Hong Kong will be able to play the role of mentor and interpreter from the inside, that is to say from within the Chinese body politic. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I often liken Hong Kong's special role to that of playing Virgil to China's Dante, showing Dante the way ahead, in a late 20th century re-enactment of the <I>Divine Comedy</i> in an East Asian setting to herald the impending dawn of the Pacific Century. And after traversing Hell and Purgatory, eventually we will hopefully reach also Paradise at the end of our journey.

as for China, this is a critical relationship, one that will significantly shape the economic and 
strategic contours of the Asia-Pacific region. This is a region in which the United States has vital 
national interests at stake. Indeed, China's emergence as a great power, how it integrates into the 
international system or fails to do so, will be among the defining issues for the United States, for 
Asia, and for the international community for at least the first quarter of the next century. Our 
speakers today have played significant roles in the evolution and development of United States 
relations with China over the past 25 years. Looking ahead, their experience, both inside and 
outside the government, and their judgment should serve as useful and thoughtful guides in dealing 
with the challenges of the next century.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="free">CHAS FREEMAN</a>: Thank you very much, 
Jim. I'm going to go right into the subject of U.S.-China relations and a variety of issues that have 
arisen in those relations. 
 On one level, U.S.-China relations are flourishing. Economic interaction and cultural exchange are 
very healthy elements of Washington's relationship with Beijing, but political relations are deeply 
strained. They are drifting. The situation is highly unstable for several reasons which I will address. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent so-called summit meeting in New York between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton was a great success in the sense that the highest 
aspiration of both sides was to prevent further deterioration in their relations, and that objective was 
achieved. The meeting accomplished virtually nothing in positive terms and left many questions 
unresolved. Indeed, it may have inadvertently confirmed a Chinese view that the United States is 
indifferent to the fate of Taiwan. The Taiwan issue, which is the central issue in U.S.-China 
relations at the moment, continues to be one that the Administration does not wish to address, and 
which the Chinese are happy to see the United States neglect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is often stated in this city that the strain in U.S.-China relations 
on the political level is the product of some sort of succession crisis in Beijing, or of domestic 
difficulties in China. Neither proposition can stand up to scrutiny. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the succession has in fact occurred. One of Deng Xiaoping's 
great achievements is to be a Chinese leader who turned over to others responsibility for leading the 
country while he was still alive--something that is rare in Chinese history and which will be a great 
contribution to Chinese political culture if others emulate it in the future. There are differences 
between leaders in Beijing just as there are differences in every capital between political leaders 
(we've just had an illustration of that in this city), but to describe this as a power struggle in terms of 
the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s is a gross overstatement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second issue that is cited is the four difficulties that China 
faces domestically, which some would call crises. I do not call them crises because they are not 
urgent; nor are they impossible to resolve. But there are four major difficulties facing the new 
Chinese government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first is a spiritual or ideological vacuum. The Chinese people 
are cynical about ideology, and nationalism alone now serves as a strong force for Chinese unity. 
Nationalism is not a congenial principle in terms of management of difficult issues like the Taiwan 
question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second problem is the pattern of Chinese economic 
development, which has rested on bureaucratic entrepreneurship. When bureaucrats buy and sell 
things, people buy and sell bureaucrats. In other words, corruption is the inevitable result. From the 
point of view of the Chinese populace, corruption is probably the central issue in Chinese politics at 
present. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The third problem is the lack of definition of relationships between 
the center and the provinces. This is not a crisis; things work. Thirteen percent economic growth for 
the last three years or so is not bad by any standard; it was 10 percent for the previous decade. Yet 
the center is trying to do things which it is incapable of doing, and the provinces are trying to do 
things which they are incapable of doing. The result is confusion and a measure of unpredictability 
about decisions that are important in economic and political terms. This is an issue which must be 
addressed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The final problem, I believe, is in the context of rising nationalism 
and an inadequate structure for civilian control of the military. I will leave that for a later 
discussion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These factors do have an influence on U.S.-China bilateral 
relations, but it is not the decisive influence. Let me simply make an obvious point. China now 
enjoys its best relations in history with most of the world's great powers. The relationship between 
China and Russia is the most equal and healthy that it has been in two centuries. Relations between 
China and the great powers of Europe--including Britain, where differences over Hong Kong have 
recently been set aside; Germany, which is actively courting China; and France, which after some 
difficulties over the Taiwan question has returned to the good graces of Beijing--are all as good as 
they have ever been in this century. Relations between China and Japan, due to careful management 
by both sides, have not been troubled as they were in the past. They are probably the best that they 
have been in many, many years. Relations with India are the best since the 1950s. Only the United 
States is an exception. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we look for why this is the case, perhaps we should look not in 
Beijing, but here. American relations with Japan and Britain are the least cordial and effective they 
have been since World War II. Relations with Germany are the least intimate they have been since 
the 1950s. Relations with France are the most strained they have been since the early 1960s. U.S. 
relations with Russia are deeply troubled, and relations with India still fall far short of their 
potential. So perhaps we should ask why China should be the exception in U.S. foreign relations, 
rather than looking for explanations inside China. Nevertheless, the fact is that U.S.-China relations 
have taken some very hard knocks over the past five or six years. Remember how this relationship 
began. It began at the outset of the 1970s, based on a common strategic concern with Soviet 
expansionism. It rested on several principles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first was to pursue, first, strategic dialogue and later, after 
1979's normalization agreement, strategic cooperation. The second was to live and let live in terms 
of ideological differences and the differences between the two societies' cultural and social 
traditions. Mutual tolerance rather than mutual harping and criticism were agreed. We set aside 
regional differences--even major ones about the Vietnam War at the beginning of the 1970s--in 
order to pursue these larger interests in cooperation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This relationship also entailed a series of very delicate 
compromises on the issue of Taiwan. These centered on American acknowledgment, and then 
recognition, of the principle that there was only one China and that Taiwan is part of China. In the 
first instance, this was a common belief in Taipei and Beijing. In the normalization communiqu, it 
was the position of the Chinese government recognized by the United States. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This principle of managing relations with Taiwan found expression 
in three communiqus. Let me review those briefly. The Shanghai Communiqu of 1972 
abandoned U.S. policies of containment towards China and reached a compromise on the Taiwan 
issue, taking the United States out of the middle of the Chinese civil war while expressing the 
expectation and hope that the Chinese parties concerned on either side of the strait would work out 
a peaceful solution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Normalization Communiqu replaced the strategic dialogue 
initiated in the Shanghai Communiqu with strategic cooperation. It strengthened the U.S. formula 
with regard to Taiwan, acknowledging the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China and that 
there is only one China. It recognized Beijing as the site of the only legal Chinese government and 
traded form for substance in U.S. relations with Taiwan so that the United States--within the 
context of recognizing one China and Taiwan as part of China--would be able to maintain 
economic, cultural, and other unofficial ties with the people of Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In August of 1982, the tacit normalization understandings about 
arms sales to Taiwan were made explicit and strengthened. China acknowledged that U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan would continue, and the U.S. agreed to cap the quality of those arms sales and to 
reduce them step by step, leading over time to a final resolution of the dispute. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the history. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the Chinese perspective, the United States has now strayed 
from or explicitly violated every one of the undertakings that I have just cited. This is the core of 
the problem from Beijing's point of view. From the American point of view, I would say, events 
from 1989-1991 destroyed the agreement to set aside ideology in the interest of strategic 
cooperation and replaced tolerance with strident criticism of Chinese human rights practices and an 
ideological confrontation, which has continued. These events then destroyed the strategic triangle. 
The Soviet Union itself -- the common enemy--disappeared. At the same time, Taiwan began to 
withdraw from the consensus it had previously enjoyed with Beijing, that it was part of China and 
that the division of China was an unnatural state of affairs which time and dialogue should repair. 
And, finally, over this period, the United States abandoned an effort we had conducted for 15 years 
to integrate China into global institutions. Increasingly, global institutions were crafted with China 
on the outside. That was the case with the Missile Technology Control Regime. It was the case with 
the Australia Group. More recently, it is the case with the successor to COCOM -- the New Forum. 
We thus have guaranteed that these global regimes will be a source of friction in U.S.-China 
relations. China will not be bound by rules that it did not participate in crafting. Frankly, none of 
these regimes can work because they exclude one of the principal actors with regard to their subject 
matter. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn now to the present and close. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This drift and the absence of consensus on a strategic framework 
for the relationship, the absence of strict adherence by either side to understandings that have been 
reached, and the emergence of a strong drive in Taiwan for a separate international identity have 
come together to produce the collapse of mutual confidence and trust. They have engendered 
Chinese effort to deal with the Taiwan issue separately from the United States. In the late spring, 
the Chinese saw Lee Teng-hui come here and Lien Chan (the Prime Minister) go to Europe. They 
saw an offer of a billion dollars to the United Nations for a separate seat for Taiwan. They 
interpreted these things as a major offensive by Taiwan against the status quo, and a breaking of the 
tacit modus vivendi which had preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait. Their response has been 
somewhat erratic but has settled down into the following pattern. You might call this <i>xuan ying 
jian shi</i> -- soft and hard policies simultaneously applied.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the hard policy. It is clear that in the summer the People's 
Liberation Army received authorization to use force against Taiwan to re-impose a <i>modus 
vivendi</i> in the Taiwan Strait. Of the series of exercises to be conducted, two of six known to be 
scheduled have already been carried out. One is apparently about to begin. These exercises are not 
an empty show of force. They are a campaign of military intimidation which could, and may well 
as the coming year unfolds, extend into the actual outbreak of combat in the Taiwan Strait and even 
strikes against Taiwan targets. This campaign of pressure will continue until Taiwan returns to the 
<i>modus vivendi</i> from which it strayed over the preceding year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the soft side, at the same time that this pressure is being 
applied, the PRC has escalated indications of flexibility in terms of reunification. Without getting 
into detail, I can say that Beijing has very clearly signaled to Taiwan that many things which had 
previously seemed non-negotiable are now up for negotiation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the point of view of the United States, which had hoped that 
the Taiwan issue was behind us, this is a most unfortunate set of developments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are many people in Taiwan who are convinced that the 
United States has a commitment to come to Taiwan's aid in the event that its actions provoke 
conflict with the mainland. They are not correct. There is no such commitment, and Taipei should 
not bank on such American steadfastness in pursuit of objectives that the United States has not 
endorsed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing for its part contains many people, including senior 
members of the Chinese military, who are convinced that the United States will not intervene in the 
Taiwan Strait or come to Taiwan's assistance in the event of conflict arising. These people, too, are 
mistaken. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They base their conclusions on the following factors: first, that the 
United States is legally stopped from intervening in Chinese internal affairs and that Taiwan is a 
matter of Chinese internal affairs: second, that the American performance in Bosnia and in Somalia 
demonstrates a lack of resolve which would also be played out in the Taiwan Strait; and third, that 
while Taiwan is a vital interest of China which the Chinese explicitly state they are willing to 
sacrifice millions of people and entire cities to manage, it is not such an interest for the United 
States. Nor is the United States prepared to make comparable sacrifices. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is not a happy situation. In a legal sense, the Taiwan issue 
may well be a matter of Chinese internal affairs--that is not something I wish to dispute -- but in a 
strategic sense, it is anything but a local matter. The implications of conflict in the Taiwan Strait 
reach well beyond the immediate region of Greater China in two senses. First, I believe it is true 
that the region sometimes called Greater China -- that is, the region of "Straits China," the region 
from Shanghai to Hong Kong, including Taiwan -- will determine the future of China. The future of 
China will determine the future of the Asia-Pacific region. I believe it is most likely that the future 
of the Asia-Pacific region will determine the future of the world, at least for the next century or two. 
Second, if there is conflict in the Taiwan Strait the United States will indeed have to make a 
decision about whether we intervene or don't. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't intervene, I believe the strategic consequences are 
enormous. The United States has no intrinsic strategic interest in Taiwan, but we do have an interest 
derived from our responsibility for the strategic defense of Japan. That interest, plus his ideology of 
anti- communism, is what led MacArthur in 1949 and early 1950 to dissent from the Truman 
Administration's decision to let the People's Liberation Army conquer Taiwan without opposition. 
He sat in the imperial army headquarters in Tokyo. Like everyone before him who had sat there 
from the time of the Meiji restoration, he saw the strategic importance of Taiwan to Japan's defense. 
Therefore, when Kim Il-Sung attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, the Seventh Fleet was 
interposed in the Taiwan Strait for two purposes: to prevent the spread of the Korean War and the 
outbreak from its existing borders of the Sino-Soviet bloc and, second, to discharge American 
responsibilities for the strategic defense of Japan. If the United States did not come to Taiwan's aid, 
and if we do not manage the Taiwan question in a suitable manner, Japan will feel betrayed. This is 
not simply a matter of strategic betrayal. It has emotional overtones. There are many people in 
Taiwan who have fond feelings for Japan and many in Japan who have fond feelings for those 
Taiwanese. This is rather unusual in Asia. In fact, Taiwanese are by far the most admiring of 
Japanese among Asians. This is a close emotional relationship. If Japan cannot count on the United 
States to defend its strategic interests, it must do so itself. That means Japan must assume 
responsibility for its own defense. That is Japanese rearmament. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the United States does come to Taiwan's assistance in the event 
of conflict, we must use bases in Japan to do so. That will pose a terrible dilemma for the Japanese 
government. One strategic imperative of Japanese policy is to avoid a hostile relationship with the 
mainland of China. It would have to choose between that strategic imperative on the one hand and 
its interest in maintaining the U.S. alliance and its strategic interest in Taiwan on the other. I believe 
Japan would choose the United States and Taiwan. I also believe no future Japanese government 
would ever be willing to be put in a position again in which foreigners made such a momentous 
strategic decision for Japan. The result in this case would be rearmament, but at a slower pace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So whether the United States chose to intervene or not, whether the 
PRC succeeded in bringing Taiwan within its orbit or not, the Taiwan issue has the potential to 
overthrow the entire Asian-Pacific strategic balance: not simply to poison U.S.-China relations for 
decades, but also to break the U.S.-Japan alliance and to reignite rivalry between Japan and China, 
with all of the implications in terms of an Asian pattern of containment of China that this might 
itself set off. Therefore, I believe the drift in U.S.-China relations, the failure of the United States 
and China to manage the Taiwan issue, and the very rash actions which Taipei has been taking are a 
great danger to the peace and security of the East Asian and Western Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="hard">HARRY HARDING</a>: It's a great pleasure 
to be here this morning, and especially to see so large an audience, containing people every bit as 
knowledgeable about China as the four of us on this panel. The size of the crowd is not only a 
tribute to the convening power of <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> and his 
colleagues at The Heritage Foundation, but also an indication of the widespread interest in China's 
growing role in world affairs. As Chas Freeman has just said, China will be the determining factor 
in the future of the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chas's remarks have focused on the Taiwan issue. I want to look 
more broadly at the U.S.-China relationship, organizing my comments around three headings. First 
of all, I will suggest why we have legitimate cause for concern about the future of China. Second, 
however, I will argue equally fervently that we should not exaggerate our concern about China, but 
should keep the rise of China in perspective. And finally, I'll draw the implications for American 
policy. I'll suggest that neither of the two policy alternatives most usually discussed--containment 
and engagement -- is a fully adequate or appropriate strategy for dealing with China in the decades 
ahead. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Why are we concerned about the rise of China?  Different people 
will give you different answers to this question. Some would stress China's domestic 
circumstances: that it remains a Communist country, or that it is not yet democratic. My concern is 
more with China's international behavior, and with the nature of the international community 
surrounding China. I can summarize my concern in the following four points:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First of all, we are concerned because we are seeing a dramatic 
increase in China's national capabilities, both its economic capabilities and, at least potentially, its 
military capabilities. We see rapid economic growth, we see significant increases (at least in 
nominal terms) in the official Chinese military budget, and we see a commitment to acquire force 
projection capabilities. We also know from the historical record that China is willing to use force to 
achieve its national objectives, even when others might argue that the odds are against it or that it is 
not fully rational in doing so.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, we realize that China is not a status quo power. It is a 
demandeur both regionally and, to a degree, globally. Its most obvious demands involve its 
territorial claims, most notably to the South China Sea and to Taiwan. It is also clear that China 
seeks major power status and the acknowledgment of that status by others. It seeks to expand its 
influence in the institutions and forums that make decisions economically and strategically for the 
region and the world. China's ambitions are being fueled by rising nationalism. This is not just an 
elite-sponsored nationalism; indeed, I do not yet see any concerted attempt by the Chinese 
government to fan the flames of nationalism. Instead, this is largely a popular nationalism, 
emerging among young people and urban intellectuals, many of whom we might have supposed 
were predisposed to the United States and to the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, China is not proving to be fully cooperative in various 
international regimes and relationships, both multilateral and bilateral. It is very skeptical about 
non-proliferation regimes, about arms control and disarmament regimes (especially in the nuclear 
field), about environmental regimes, about many global and regional economic regimes, and about 
some of the bilateral trade agreements that it has undertaken with the United States.
<p.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the environment surrounding China, a very important 
determinant of any country's international behavior, is not entirely stable. There are long-term 
uncertainties about the balance among the major powers in the region, and about their political 
relationships. There are important potential flash points around China's periphery, including the 
Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and Indochina more generally. Key 
countries that are strategically important to China have uncertain domestic futures, particularly 
Burma, Cambodia, Mongolia, and North Korea. The collapse or the fragmentation of these 
countries could produce pressures or opportunities for Chinese intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while all of these developments are grounds for concern, I 
want to emphasize that alarmist thinking is not warranted at this point. The Chinese make a 
distinction between <i>guanxin</i>, which means to be concerned about something, and 
<i>danxin</i>, which means to be very worried about something. My attitude towards China 
currently is much more one of concern than it is one of alarm. This is because each of the four 
points I've mentioned requires immediate qualification. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, let me return to China's capabilities. It is very dangerous to 
make the kind of straight-line long-term forecasts that figure so prominently in the discussion of 
China's future here in the United States. Although the Chinese may not be facing an acute or 
immediate crisis along any of the four dimensions that Chas Freeman identified, it is facing chronic 
problems that are potentially extremely serious. Indeed, one discovers that as one travels around the 
periphery of China, other Asian countries are at least as concerned about China's long-term 
weakness as they are about its long-term strength. Or, to put it differently, they are as worried about 
the unconventional security threats that would come from collapse as much as they are concerned 
about the more conventional security threats that would come from strength. In contrast, the 
analysis of China in the United States has not yet fully come to grips with the challenges to China's 
continued economic and social success in the middle to long term.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With regard to the military more specifically, to say that China is 
increasing its nominal military budget and is seeking to acquire force projection capabilities does 
not mean that China is in a position immediately to attain this kind of modern military force. China 
remains far behind the United States and other major powers technologically, and will remain so for 
many years. While we should monitor China's military preparations very carefully, I don't think we 
should overreact to them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, although China is not a status quo power, it also is not a 
revolutionary power or even a power that seeks major changes in the international system. In the 
1960s, China was exactly that: a revolutionary power that sought to overthrow every single major 
international institution from the United Nations to the World Bank and to promote revolutionary 
insurgencies throughout the Third World. Today, in contrast, China does not seek to undermine 
international institutions, but rather to expand its role within them, just as a claimant to major 
power status might be expected to do. Although this is a matter of some concern, it is not as 
threatening to the international community as is the behavior of truly revolutionary powers that 
regard the international structure as fundamentally illegitimate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, with regard to China's willingness to cooperate, I'm editing 
a volume on the patterns of cooperation in China's international conduct, which I hope will appear 
in print sometime next year. The basic thesis of the book is that, although China is by no means 
fully cooperative in international affairs, it has become increasingly cooperative over the last 150 
years. Chinese leaders have come to understand that they need cooperative international interaction 
to achieve their domestic and foreign objectives. They are therefore increasingly willing to work 
within international institutions and to forge cooperative relationships with other countries. The 
pattern of China's behavior--albeit more in the economic realm than in the security sphere--has 
increasingly been to accept the strictures of the international community. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, although the environment surrounding China is not 
entirely tranquil, still, in comparison with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the most 
vibrant and stable in the world. There are no power vacuums into which China can easily expand. 
There is a good chance of dealing constructively with the flashpoints and unstable countries around 
China's periphery. So the situation today is very different from the situation that confronted the last 
aspirant to major power status in Asia, namely Japan in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan 
faced a China in collapse and a number of European colonies in Asia at a time of European 
retrenchment. That was obviously a much more unstable and less vibrant international environment 
than we see in Asia today. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn finally to the third section of my remarks, about the 
implications for U.S. policy. I'm not satisfied with any of the three major alternatives which have 
been put out on the table in recent years. The first of these is one that I didn't even mention in my 
introductory remarks because, fortunately, it has begun to fall out of favor: a policy of fragmenting 
China, encouraging its breakup into its constituent regions and provinces. There's an internal 
contradiction in that policy that I've never been able to fully understand. If China were really so 
weak that we could cause it to break apart, then why would it pose such a threat to American 
security that a policy of fragmentation would be warranted?  Moreover, a policy of fragmentation 
would be guaranteed to ignite precisely the kind of Chinese nationalism that it is in our interest to 
avoid. And even if we were successful in catalyzing China's disintegration, the fragmentation of 
that country would be an extremely messy process that would have security consequences very 
detrimental to the interests of the United States and its allies. So a policy of fragmentation fails, 
with regard both to the end that it pursues and to the means that it entails.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Containment is, of course, the policy that is more frequently 
presented these days as an alternative to the Clinton Administration's approach. In my judgment, 
the analysis of China's intentions and capabilities that I have presented does not warrant a strategy 
of containing Chinese influence or seeking to hamper China's rise to major power status. Were we 
to do so at this point, we would find ourselves engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating a 
hostile China. In addition, we would find that no other Asian government -- not Japan, not South 
Korea, not Southeast Asia, not even Taiwan or Vietnam -- would join us in this undertaking. So we 
would be taking on China absolutely alone, condemning ourselves to an adversarial relationship 
with China and therefore to a second Cold War. If it's necessary, a containment policy can, of 
course, be adopted later. But it is by no means an optimal choice for the United States, and it is 
neither necessary nor desirable for us to select this strategy under present circumstances. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alternative that the Clinton Administration puts forward is the 
policy known as "comprehensive engagement."  There are several problems with this strategy. One 
is that the key word, "engagement," has so many different meanings that it is very difficult to 
explain it to anyone else. It could denote, for example, a betrothal or an agreement to get 
married--certainly not what it means in this particular case. It could mean a military battle, which is 
what many Chinese believe that it means. Or it can mean a meshing of gears or a process of 
dialogue and interaction, which is what the Clinton Administration wants it to mean. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But even if we go beyond the semantic confusion that surrounds 
the term "engagement," we find that it refers to process without substance. Our engagement with 
China is guided by what vision, and directed at what objectives?  In the end, the concept of 
engagement is an empty one. It refers to dialogue and interaction but does not give a clear sense of 
what American objectives are. As short-sighted and ill-conceived as they are, at least the concepts 
of fragmentation and containment tell you very clearly what American goals towards China would 
be. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So what's the alternative?  Well, I've never been a good phrase-
maker, and I'm not entirely satisfied with the word that I will put forward. But I would recommend 
a policy of integration: attempting to integrate China into an increasingly vibrant community of 
nations in the Asia-Pacific region in which the United States is also an active participant. In other 
words, our policy should be to encourage the expansion of China's bilateral political and economic 
ties with its neighbors and its active and responsible participation in the emerging economic and 
security institutions that are being established in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, people in the Clinton Administration might well say that that 
is what they mean by "engagement," even though they don't spell out their objectives quite so 
clearly. But I think there are some significant differences between a policy of engagement and a 
policy of integration. First of all, by talking of integrating China into a regional community, we 
immediately put our policy in a multilateral setting and not just a bilateral one. A policy of 
integration implies that we work together with our friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region to 
enmesh China in a system of mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral institutions. In short, 
whereas engagement is an essentially bilateral strategy, integration is inherently multilateral, 
although successfully managing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States 
would be a prerequisite for its success. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, a policy of integration would require us to identify our 
common interests with China more clearly, as well as to delineate our concerns about Beijing, 
something that the Clinton Administration has still not fully done. We might say that we welcome 
China's emergence as a major actor in the international economy, including its ability to export to 
other countries, but that we are also asking that China open up its own markets to trade and 
investment from other countries, including the United States. We could make clear that we 
welcome China's growing prosperity, which is good both for the Chinese people and for the rest of 
the world, but that, at the same time, we are concerned about the environmental consequences of 
Chinese industrialization. We should indicate that we acknowledge China's right to national 
security and to a reasonable defense establishment, but that we are very concerned about the 
possibility that China's growing military capability could be destabilizing to the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially when not conducted in a transparent way. And we could say that we respect the 
desire of both the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for political stability, but that we believe 
that genuine stability can be achieved better through a process of gradual and sustained political 
reform than through repression alone. That kind of statement, identifying both our common 
interests and our differences with the Chinese, would be an important element of an integration 
policy. Such a statement of American objectives has generally been absent from the articulation of 
our engagement policy thus far. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, because of its multilateral dimension, a policy of 
integration alerts us to the importance of not just having a clear strategy towards China, but also 
promoting the stability and vitality of the region as a whole. Security threats are not produced 
simply by the rise of an ambitious or irresponsible major power. Rather, they are created by the rise 
of such a power in an international environment that provides it with either nettlesome provocation 
or easy opportunities. It's therefore very important for us and our friends in the region to maintain 
an international environment that sends a very clear signal to the Chinese: 
<p><ul>
<li>We welcome you into our international community on mutually beneficial terms.
<p>
<li>We are not going to do things that impinge upon your vital national interests. 
<p>
<li>We are not going to create easy opportunities for you to take unfair advantage of. 
<p>
<li>If you attempt to take unreasonable advantage of those opportunities, you will find that the 
community will come together to resist your encroachments and that it has both the resources and 
the political will to do so. 
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So in sum, although this policy of integration is obviously closer to 
engagement than it is to either containment or fragmentation, I think there are three differences: It 
positions the United States as part of an Asia-Pacific community seeking to integrate China, rather 
than focusing so narrowly on our bilateral ties with Beijing; it identifies our common interests with 
the Chinese, as well as the areas in which we differ; and it places as much emphasis on managing 
the regional setting surrounding China as on trying directly to influence Chinese thinking and 
behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="feld">HARVEY FELDMAN</a>: I am not nearly as 
apocalyptic as Chas and I fear probably not as brief as Harry, so I hope you will bear with me, 
particularly because I want to examine the Taiwan leg of this triangular relationship between 
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei in a way that we haven't quite come to grips with yet. And the first 
thing I have to say is that it seems to me that for some 50 years now, our China and Taiwan policies 
have been built upon an interlocked set of confusions and misperceptions. From 1950 to 1979, we 
took the position that China's legal government somehow was lodged in Taipei. Since 1979 we 
have genuflected to Beijing's position that it is also the government of Taiwan. Each of these 
stances is as totally unrealistic as the other. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Chas pointed out, successive administrations have said that our 
China and Taiwan policies are based on the three communiqus which he enumerated: Shanghai 
'72, the Recognition Communiqu '78, and the August 17, 1982, communiqu decreasing arms 
sales to Taiwan, plus something called the Taiwan Relations Act. There are substantial 
contradictions among these documents and an even more basic misunderstanding of what they 
mean in their legal effect. The three communiqus are policy statements by the Nixon, Carter, and 
Reagan Administrations. Although the Bush and Clinton Administrations also have adhered to their 
terms, the communiqus are not a body of law, international or domestic. Embedded in them is the 
famous "one-China policy" so often cited to us by White House and State Department spokesmen 
and others as the rationale for a policy which seems so often to be irrational. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Recognition Communiqu signed by Carter in '78 is the one-
China formula most often quoted: "the government of the United States of America acknowledges 
the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China."  This is a unilateral 
statement of position; it is not a treaty. Nor does it mean, despite what Chas has said, that the 
United States accepts the PRC position that Taiwan is a part of China. Had we said, for example, 
the government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that Mao 
Zedong sits on the right hand of God and has learned to brush his teeth, that wouldn't mean that we 
believed it. It would mean that we understand that is what the Chinese government believes to be 
the case. The acknowledgment formula is an elegant way of saying we hear you and we don't 
contradict you. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By contrast, the Taiwan Relations Act, Public Law 96-8 of April 
10, 1979, is the law of the land. It establishes a continuing relationship between the United States 
and Taiwan on an unofficial basis to "preserve and promote extensive close and friendly 
commercial, cultural and other relations."  It also states that the United States considers "any effort 
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means including boycotts and embargoes 
is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
States." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The language "threat to the peace and security of the Western 
Pacific area" was chosen by the Congress for a very specific reason. It replicates the language of 
Chapter Six, "peaceful settlement of disputes," and Chapter Seven, "action with respect to threats to 
the peace," of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, in a statement which is reminiscent of the 
former Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, the Act goes on to say, "the president is 
directed to inform the Congress promptly of any threat to the security of the social or economic 
system of the people on Taiwan and any danger arising to the interests of the United States 
therefrom. The president and the Congress shall determine in accordance with Constitutional 
processes appropriate action by the United States in response to any such danger." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There can be no question that the TRA mandates a much closer 
relationship with Taiwan and with its people than is contemplated by the three communiqus and, 
of course, a much closer relationship with Taiwan than the PRC has wanted us to have. From Carter 
on, administrations have been pressured by Beijing to ignore the plain meaning of the Taiwan 
Relations Act and to cut back on that relationship. In varying degrees, all have been willing to do 
so, reinterpreting the law to suit policy considerations and presumed economic interests. These 
contradictions were much easier to deal with when Taiwan was, like the mainland, a police state 
with all the apparatus of repression, the political prisoners and so on and so forth. Under those 
circumstances the pretensions of the government on Taiwan could be and were treated with a kind 
of amused contempt, and the United States concentrated on getting on with Beijing while still doing 
business with and admitting students from Taiwan. And, of course, the central core of this policy 
was the need to add China as a makeweight in the worldwide struggle with the Soviet Union. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But now the situation has changed. Not only is the Cold War over, 
but in a remarkably short period of time Taiwan has evolved into a full fledged democracy. It is no 
longer that authoritarian police state. In fact, for the first time in all four thousand years of Chinese 
history, there is a multiparty democracy, a free press, no political prisoners, a representative 
Parliament in which seats are contested at election time. And the major opposition party was 
recently given license to own and operate a television station. Next March, the head of state on 
Taiwan will be chosen by free popular vote, again something unique in Chinese history. Moreover, 
the division of national income on Taiwan is probably the most egalitarian in all of Asia and far 
more egalitarian than here in the United States. To top it all off, the government in Taipei no longer 
asserts any claim to be the legitimate government of all China. It takes the position that within the 
broad historic and cultural entity of China, there are now two governments, that each of them rules 
a defined territory, that each has all the attributes of sovereignty that entitle it to recognition. The 
government in Taipei points out that the government in Beijing has never since its founding on 
October 1, 1949, ruled Taiwan even for a single day. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So, under these circumstances, what should American policy be?  
Well, we're often given the mantra that goes: PRC is very, very large; PRC is a major military 
power; PRC is a growing economic power; PRC has a seat on the Security Council; Taiwan has 
none of those things. Therefore, the PRC is very, very important to us and Taiwan is not important 
at all, except perhaps, as Chas suggested, strategically in the case of Japan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I would make a different argument. Twenty-one million people, 
the population of Taiwan, is not an inconsiderable amount of people, unless you're comparing it 
with the population on the mainland. Twenty-one million people is, after all, the population of 
Australia plus New Zealand plus all the rest of the South Pacific combined. The PRC is much 
larger, but I don't know that size ought to be the criterion of American policy. If size were the 
criterion, we would have taken the part of Indonesia back in the Sukarno days when it was in 
confrontation with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. In fact, if size were the criterion, we 
would never have founded NATO because, after all, the Soviet Union was very, very large and had 
a very large army and a seat in the Security Council -- all the things that China has. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, policies should not be determined by size but by interests. 
We have a great many of these with the PRC, and they are often interests that deal with issues of 
global reach. We want PRC cooperation with the Security Council on non-proliferation matters and 
on specific problems of trade. In fact, the issues that we have on our China agenda are a great many 
indeed: PRC export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and perhaps to Iran; PRC shipments of 
missile components to Iran and perhaps Iraq; drug trans-shipment through Yunan; piracy of 
American intellectual property; the question of cooperation to restrain the North Korean drive to 
acquire nuclear weapons; export to the U.S. of prison-made goods; reneging on commitments to 
allow Red Cross visits to political prisoners; and, of course, the terms of entry into the World Trade 
Organization. This is without even getting into the question of PRC violation of the norms of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined by the United Nations Charter and by 
international instruments which the PRC itself has signed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list is long and obviously contentious, but I have to say that 
the fact that it is long and contentious is not the result of American ill will. In almost every instance, 
everything that is on our agenda puts us in the position of asking Beijing either to make good on a 
promise which it had given us previously, to remain faithful to an international obligation which it 
voluntarily assumed, or to adhere to a standard agreed to by the international community at large. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From Beijing's point of view, of course, we look like an obnoxious 
bill collector who comes knocking at their door at all kinds of awkward times. But, in fact, the bills 
are important and the debts were honorably incurred. It's hard for me to take seriously the argument 
of some who say that by asking the PRC leadership to make good on these promises that they've 
given, and to live up to the agreements they have signed, we are convincing them that we have 
become a hostile power adopting a policy of containment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We've often been told that how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is going to directly affect how the PRC responds to that specific agenda and, therefore, we 
have no choice but to reject Taiwan's hopes for better treatment at our hands because we need the 
PRC. We need the PRC, goes the litany, and we don't need Taiwan. Therefore, in the larger 
interests of regional stability and world peace, we have to take account of Beijing's sensitivities, and 
especially those sensitivities that concern Taiwan. But it seems to me that the claim that PRC 
behavior on regional and world issues is conditioned by how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is simply farfetched. How we deal with Taiwan will certainly affect our relationship with 
Beijing. It may mean that things might get pretty cold. But Beijing sold nuclear technology and 
missiles to Iran long before Lee Teng-hui was admitted to the United States to speak to an alumni 
group at Cornell. The PRC's claim that the entire South China Sea is their territorial water has 
nothing to do with Lee Teng-hui's visit or our sale of F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact of the matter is, the policy Beijing adopts with regard to 
any of the items on our agenda responds to their view of their interests and, of course, to the 
exigencies of their own domestic and factional politics. Now I don't mean to suggest that their 
views are unimportant. They obviously are important. Nor do I mean to suggest that we should 
break off dialogue. Obviously, we want to continue. But there is no reason for us not to press our 
own interests with persistence and without hesitation, because they are our interests, and we should 
do so without any apology, no matter whether they refer to the Korean Peninsula, the South China 
Sea, the Philippines, or even Taiwan. I have never believed that we need or should take the view 
that a fruitful Washington-Beijing relationship has to be more important to us than it has to be to 
the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I want to point out that we do have interests in Taiwan as well, 
though they are not on the macro world level. About a million Americans have roots in that island. 
It is our fifth, perhaps sixth trading partner. But probably most important of all, it is an example of a 
one-time police state, a Chinese police state at that, that has transformed itself into a democracy. 
This is something that we should value, something we should want maintained, something that we 
should want maintained before the eyes of the Chinese people on the mainland because our and the 
world's interests would be enhanced if that example were imitated on the mainland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as the strategic element is concerned, given PRC behavior in 
the South China Sea, I cannot conceive that it would be in our interest to have the PRC control both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as the waters of the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the 
Philippines. This doesn't mean that we have to support Taiwan's claims or become its sponsor on 
the international scene. But I think it does mean that we should treat it with dignity and with a 
seriousness that its accomplishments deserve. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Public Law 96-8, the Taiwan Relations Act, speaks in terms of 
unofficial cultural and commercial relations with Taiwan, so it seems to me there was no reason for 
us ever to have made a fuss about granting a visa to Lee Teng-hui to speak to an alumni group at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca is not the navel of the universe. Indeed, it seems to 
me it was the continuing insistence of the State Department that granting such a visa would destroy 
the basis of our one-China policy that created this scandal and its aftermath. If the State Department 
says giving the visa is going to destroy our one-China policy, what can Beijing say?  It can hardly 
say anything less. Let me point out that in the year before we granted that visa, the Prime Minister 
of Taiwan, Lien Chan, spoke at a graduation at the University of Chicago, which is his alma mater, 
and his Foreign Minister Chen Fo had visited the United States twice. Beijing said nothing about it 
either time. Why?  This was all done very, very quietly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think, with Beijing and with Taipei, we should do what our 
interests and our honor require of us. I think our honor requires that we not turn our back on the 
government that has transformed itself into a democracy, and our interest requires that there be no 
aggression in the Taiwan Strait. Here I have to say that deterrence is a very, very important factor, 
and I agree with Chas we have to tell the people on Taiwan that they cannot count on our assistance 
if they crudely provoke Beijing to action. But we also have to say to Beijing that they cannot 
conclude we would stand idly by in the event of invasion, boycott, or embargo, exactly as is stated 
in the Taiwan Relations Act. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as Taiwan's hopes to raise its international profile, I think 
there are things in our interest that we can and should do. We found it in our interest to help Taiwan 
back into the Asian Development Bank. Given the fact that Taiwan has a hundred billion dollars in 
foreign exchange reserves, I see no reason why we should not try to have Taiwan enter into some 
form of association with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World 
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It's worth noting that Taiwan continued to be a 
member of the Bank and the Fund for nine years after it lost its General Assembly seat, making the 
point that you don't have to be a member of the General Assembly to be a member of the Bank and 
the Fund. It's also interesting to note that the PRC is that Bank's largest debtor. If Taiwan is willing 
to lend money to the PRC, I say let them do it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="sol">RICHARD SOLOMON</a>: This panel 
discussion has covered very rich and controversial material. Let me try to pull together some of the 
key points in terms of policy.
I should begin by saying that my political instinct--which over more than a dozen years of 
government work I've learned to trust--is that within a decade we are likely to be back in a military 
confrontation with the PRC. There are territorial and strategic issues of extreme importance to both 
the United States and the PRC that, without wise and engaged leadership, are very likely to impel 
us back in the direction of a confrontation. What I'll try to do here is to suggest there is a way to 
cope with these issues in a more constructive way than confrontation, but it does require a 
leadership commitment on both sides that I'm not sure is there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The crisis in U.S.-PRC relations of this past summer ("mini-crisis" 
might be more appropriate) over a range of factors--the Lee Teng-hui visit, the Harry Wu 
case--played an important role in focusing our attention on issues related to the U.S.-China 
relationship that, frankly, we haven't paid much attention to. Since the Tiananmen suppression in 
the early summer of 1989, the United States has essentially been paralyzed on China policy. In one 
night of violence, as we all saw it on CNN, the political consensus in the United States for normal 
relations with the PRC was destroyed. It put the leadership in Beijing on the political defensive; it 
de-legitimized certain PRC leaders who were seen as responsible for the violence; and it made it 
very difficult to sustain a high-level dialogue between Washington and Beijing. As we all know, the 
secret Scowcroft trip to China in July of 1989, which was an effort to sustain a leadership dialogue, 
was roundly attacked in our domestic politics. And that has led to a situation where the ground rules 
for managing the U.S.-PRC relationship -- which were established during the Nixon Administration 
in the Shanghai Communiqu and the two subsequent joint communiqus on normalization in 1979 
and Taiwan arms sales in 1982 -- have now largely broken down.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think we also have to recognize that for the quarter of a century 
since President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, all the parties involved in this situation -- China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States -- have really had a very good show. Everyone has benefited 
by the stability in the region induced by U.S.-PRC normalization. It has enabled China under Deng 
Xiaoping's reforms of late 1978 to make an economic takeoff that has put China on the path to 
national economic development for the first time since the early 19th century. The "self-
strengthening" effort late in that century failed with the collapse of the Ching dynasty, and there 
followed a century of foreign intervention and revolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The turmoil of that extended period prevented the Chinese from 
taking off economically in the way, for example, that Japan, the United States, and the nations of 
Europe did. So today, for the first time in that 150-year period, the Chinese have finally attained a 
high rate of sustained economic expansion. As you know, China today is growing at more than 10 
percent a year and is projected to become the largest aggregate economy in the world sometime in 
the second or third decade of the coming century.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taiwan has flourished as well since the early 1970s. In the 25 
years since the secret Henry Kissinger trip to Beijing, Taiwan's per capita income has gone up 
tenfold, from a little over twelve hundred dollars to ten times that today. They've attained the kinds 
of reforms that Harvey Feldman has noted and have done spectacularly well for themselves. Today, 
of course, their interest is in trying to protect their achievements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the United States, for the first time in over a century, we've 
benefited from good relations with all the major players in East Asia, especially Japan and China, at 
the same time. And our domestic economic growth has been fueled in large measure by exports to 
the booming Asia-Pacific economy. I call to your attention the just-released Heritage report on 
APEC, which identifies our substantial economic interests in the region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If everyone has benefited from the situation that grew out of the 
negotiation of the Shanghai Communiqu, out of U.S.-PRC normalization, why is this mutually 
beneficial situation now breaking down?  If everybody is doing so well, why do we have such 
unease about the future?  I think our presenters today have laid out the major factors. A major 
consideration is the end of the Cold War. The rationale of "the China card," as we came to call it, 
enabled us to push off the agenda our concerns with many Chinese activities that are now at the top 
of the agenda. The human rights issue is, of course, only one factor. U.S.-China trade has grown 
tremendously, and now we're concerned about the trade imbalance and Chinese trading practices. 
We are concerned about the impact on sensitive regions of Chinese arms sales abroad. And Taiwan 
wants to find some way to stabilize its autonomy and give greater legitimacy to its 
accomplishments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, how can we fix the situation?  Is it possible to reestablish a 
set of political ground rules that will reactivate the pattern of interactions that have been so 
beneficial to all of the players in the China equation for the last quarter century?  I believe this can 
be done, but it requires an active U.S. leadership role. We have to help craft a framework for all the 
players, but without being too out-in-front on issues that are freighted with strong nationalistic and 
territorial qualities for all the Chinese parties involved.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can we lead without being out in front?  As we see in President 
Clinton's cancellation of his November trip to APEC, our nation's leadership is preoccupied, for 
very good reasons, with domestic issues. It is difficult under normal circumstances to get our 
national leaders out to Asia. During my tenure at State, Secretary of State Baker spent only one 
night in Japan, as people will recall from criticism of that fact. Asia is a long way away, and our 
interests in the region compete in our political life with very complex domestic and international 
agendas, and to get Presidents, secretaries of state, and national security advisors out to the region is 
very difficult. I think President Clinton is due credit for elevating the yearly APEC meeting to the 
summit or heads-of-state level, but it is difficult to sustain a dialogue at that level. The question we 
face is whether we can focus our national attention on Asia, as we did over the summer because of 
all the tensions, in order to play the leadership role that we must play if we are to reset the political 
parameters on the sources of potential conflict in the region. To do so would serve our national 
interest in regional stability, but it's not easy to gain a claim on the attention of our national leaders 
in the absence of a crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't do it, the passivity and drift in leadership that was 
induced after Tiananmen, the paralysis in our domestic politics about dealing with China, is likely 
to lead to initiatives by others who will force our hand and heighten tension as they pursue their 
own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One issue that was not mentioned this morning, but which should 
be seen as another source of potential trouble with the PRC, is the recession of Hong Kong to 
Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 -- something that is part of Beijing's 19th century agenda as it 
enters the 21st century. Hong Kong, as you know, was wrested from the Chinese by the British in 
the early part of the 19th century, and it will soon return to Chinese control. There is great concern 
and interest here about how that process unfolds. A set of basic agreements for Hong Kong's 
recession was negotiated in the 1980s between Beijing and London. Heritage has put out a good 
summary of U.S. interests as they will be affected by the transition in Hong Kong to PRC sovereign 
control. I personally am rather pessimistic that Beijing will handle that transition in a way that will 
provide confidence that it is abiding by its agreements with the British. My expectation is that the 
way Beijing handles Hong Kong as it takes over control will give Taiwan little comfort about how 
its interests will be dealt with in any reunification arrangement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How do we try to reset some ground rules for the United States, 
the PRC, and Taiwan relations if the Shanghai Communiqu and the other parameters of the U.S.-
PRC relationship are no longer working well?  No one wants to play the role that General George 
Marshall played in 1945. One of the basic presumptions about U.S.-China policy that evolved after 
the failure of the Marshall mission to mediate the Chinese civil war back in 1945-1946 was that we 
don't want to get caught in the middle as these two parties deal with their differences. Taiwan is 
viewed by Beijing as an internal issue, and they are not interested in having us play the role of 
mediator. Yet what happens across the Taiwan Strait is of great concern to the United States. It 
affects our national interests in very important ways--and not just economically. Remember that 
East Asia was the site of our last three major wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Generally, we get into trouble, as we did in Korea in 1950, when 
we say we're not interested, when we don't pay attention. That leads others to say, "Well, if the 
Americans are not interested, then we'll pursue our own interests."  We have to lean forward, in my 
view, and indicate in more than just words that the peaceful resolution of these territorial and 
related issues is very much in the U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now what would be the objective of an American political 
initiative?  The core objective should be to make sure that the PRC-Taiwan situation does not 
become remilitarized. Beijing's missile tests and other military activities over the last six months or 
so have shown an inclination to remilitarize the Taiwan situation, which since the Shanghai 
Communiqu Beijing has approached in a political framework. It is in our interest, and in Taiwan's, 
to see that Beijing handles the Taiwan issue in political terms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can it be done?  It seems pretty clear at the moment that the 
prospects for a successful negotiation across the Strait, which Beijing and Taipei have been 
pursuing for several years via the so-called Koo-Wong talks in Singapore, are not good. The 
question, I believe, is whether restraint will be shown on all sides, whether the deal that was struck 
between Kissinger and Chairman Mao will be sustained. In 1973, Mao told Kissinger that the 
United States and China had larger interests than a fight over Taiwan because of the Soviet 
challenge. "We don't need to resolve the Taiwan issue for a hundred years," said Mao. In effect, 
Mao was prepared to delay dealing with the issue far off into the future, as long as the United States 
supported the "one-China" principle, and to let circumstances evolve in ways that he would not be 
responsible for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today, no Chinese leader seems prepared to compromise the 
country's 19th century agenda. While Mao put the issue on the shelf, it stands like a bookend at the 
outer limit of the country's politics. Beijing's recent military pressures on Taiwan raise the question 
of whether China's contemporary leaders are preparing to take the Taiwan issue off the shelf and 
seek a solution to their goal of reunification in the near term. This is not a question they totally 
control, but my impression, based on recent high-level discussions in Beijing, is that PRC leaders -- 
even the military -- say their first priority today is economic development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, of course, their hope is that over the next 10 or 20 years they 
will sustain growth at 10 percent a year and acquire the accouterments of modern national power, 
including military power, and on that basis be in a stronger position to assert their various territorial 
and political claims.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I believe today there is still common interest among all the 
parties involved to maintain stability and focus on economic growth. The challenge for the United 
States is to re-engage in a quiet way the various parties involved in this situation to reestablish 
political parameters which will sustain the mutually beneficial situation that persisted for the past 
quarter of a century. This will require considerable restraint on the part of both the PRC and 
Taiwan. In the case of Beijing, their handling of the Hong Kong transition will be a major mood-
setter for Taiwan and could substantially degrade attitudes in the United States about the extent to 
which Beijing will honor its international agreements. This situation also requires restraint on 
Taiwan's part about how it will handle the autonomy-independence issue. From my recent visit to 
Taipei, I have the impression that responsible people are thinking seriously about how to define that 
set of issues in ways that are not a provocation to the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our own politics, since Tiananmen there has been a universal 
tendency to demonize the PRC. I would only note that our most recent ambassador to Beijing, 
Stapeleton Roy, says that much of the characterization of China in our domestic debate doesn't 
sound like the China that he lived in for four years. Having gone to China myself 25 or more times 
since the early 1970s, in terms of openness, social change, and economic transformation, what you 
see going on in that country is a set of developments which, if they are given sufficient time to play 
themselves out, are as likely to produce a China we can work with as they are a threatening China. 
But our tendency to demonize is very strong, and this may foreclose opportunities to deal 
constructively with Beijing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ultimately, the issue comes down to the Administration and 
presidential leadership. We have a capacity to engage all the players involved if it is done in the 
right way. But one of the foreign policy dilemmas we have in the post-Cold War world is that our 
domestic preoccupations make it very difficult for our national leaders to pay attention to loaded 
international issues that, if handled badly or allowed to drift, may well impose great costs on our 
country down the road.

Executive Memorandum No. 436<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	Sensing a dangerous drift in relations, President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin have laid the groundwork for a U.S.-China summit on October 24, 1995, in New York City. A great deal of work needs to be done. The U.S.-China relationship is highly unstable and, although Beijing shares much of the blame, President Clinton has only made matters worse.
<p>	
	The Clinton Administration's China policy has been like a runaway car, careening from one side of the road to the other, always in danger of running off the cliff.  It is time to regain control of U.S.-China policies. Otherwise, both U.S. interests and the security and stability of Asia will be in jeopardy.
<p>
	President Clinton should make clear to President Jiang that the U.S.-China relationship should not be focused on only one issue, such as Taiwan, or even human rights. Rather, the relationship should be broadly based. In his discussions with the Chinese president, Clinton should concentrate on four major areas of concern: 1) trade, 2) Chinese arms sales and other military provocations, 3) America's ongoing relationship with the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, and 4) the status of Hong Kong.  Discussing these issues would give the New York meeting a badly needed focus while finally putting U.S. China policy on more solid ground.
<p>
	<b>China Must Comply with Trade Agreements.</b>  China's inability or unwillingness to create an environment amenable to foreign business makes U.S. support for PRC membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) impossible. Beijing has promised to open its markets to greater international participation by strengthening its legal system, easing controls on foreign exchange, removing non-tariff barriers, and opening protected sectors of the economy. However, China so far has not lived up to its promises. 
<p>
	Beijing wants to join the WTO to guarantee its continued economic access to the international community, a critical factor in its own economic advancement. China's leadership also feels that entry into the WTO would be another signal of international acceptance of China as a world power. But if China wishes to enter the WTO, it must accept the same entry standards required of every other country. This should be made clear at the New York summit.
<p>
	President Clinton also should insist that China abide by the agreement on intellectual property rights, which it reached with the United States in January 1995. Clinton should inform the Chinese that failure to enforce the terms of the agreement will invite U.S. sanctions and cause American corporations to reassess China's commercial attractiveness.
 <p>
	<b>Hold China Accountable for Arms Violations.</b>  President Clinton should make clear that if allegations of Chinese sales of intermediate-range missiles to Pakistan and assistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program are true, these actions will be considered dangerous violations of international norms. China must be held accountable for such acts and strongly encouraged to adhere to the international "rules of the road."  The U.S. cannot ignore violations of these rules.
<p>
	President Clinton should object strongly to China's hostile military actions in the South China Sea.  Earlier this year the Chinese navy took control of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef in violation of internationally established territorial norms.  This action challenges America's interest in freedom of navigation.  Instead of merely talking about the importance of open sea channels, the U.S. should take a more active approach and make clear that the U.S. 7th Fleet can and will protect these interests.  A statement of this sort would send the unambiguous message that America intends to continue playing an active role in the security of Asia.
<p>
	<b>Maintain Relationship with Taiwan.</b>  President Clinton must resolutely communicate America's intention to continue its unofficial relationship with the Republic of China, as defined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Though the PRC will ask, the United States should not yield to Beijing's pressure to deny visas for private visits by senior ROC officials, including President Lee Teng-hui.  The U.S. must not allow China to exercise a veto over U.S.-ROC relations.
	<p>
	China has shown flexibility by allowing Taiwan to participate in various international organizations, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank.  Using these precedents, President Clinton should urge the PRC to consider and support Taiwan's membership in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization and such U.N.-related agencies as the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
<p>
	It must be made clear to President Jiang that U.S. defensive arms sales to Taiwan will continue in direct response to the security situation in the region.  Thus, because the PRC's actions will have a direct influence on the nature and quantity of arms sales to the ROC, it would be in Beijing's best interests to refrain from intimidating actions, such as last July's missile tests conducted near Taiwan.  China also should scale back its military threat to Taiwan and re-open the high-level dialogue canceled in reaction to President Lee's June visit to the U.S.  The suggestion made by President Jiang earlier this month that he would welcome a meeting with President Lee should be praised as a positive first step in strengthening the strained ties between Beijing and Taipei.
<p>
	<b>American Interests in Hong Kong.</b> President Clinton should tell President Jiang that American confidence in the U.S.-China relationship will be damaged if Hong Kong's autonomy erodes after the reversion to China in 1997. Clinton also should express strong U.S. support for Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), which was elected on September 17, 1995.  The current LegCo should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term, free of any disruption that might arise when Hong Kong reverts to PRC rule. President Clinton should be adamant about maintaining a popularly supported legislative body in Hong Kong.
<p>
	Clinton also must make it clear that the U.S. intends to conduct substantial bilateral relations with Hong Kong up to and after the 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.  This relationship should consist of, among other things, 1) strong American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership, 2) an active American consulate general, 3) continued U.S. Navy port calls, and 4) an accelerated effort to complete outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.
<p>	

	China's emergence as a major regional and global power will be America's defining foreign policy challenge in the next decade. While the PRC's future will be decided by the Chinese, it is up to America and the international community to define and communicate to Beijing the norms by which it will be judged.  Taiwan, Hong Kong, China's military development, and trade are issues important to American interests in Asia.  How Beijing responds to these issues will be a test of its intentions and behavior in Asia and the rest of the world.  The key for the Clinton Administration in the coming months, and for the U.S. in the foreseeable future, is to conduct relations with China in a more stable manner, ignoring none of these overriding issues but at the same time allowing no one issue to derail the relationship.
<p>
	Engaging Beijing requires more than rhetoric and meetings.  It also requires a clear definition of U.S. interests and priorities that serve as the basis of what the U.S. does, not merely what it says.  Words about principle are not enough. U.S. actions must be clear enough to demonstrate unambiguously that American cooperation or opposition depends on how well China adheres to international rules of the road.  If nothing else, the October meeting provides an opportunity to define these rules, which serve U.S. interests, and to begin restoring a coherence to the conduct of the President's China policy that has been lost in recent years.

October 2, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in this month's legislative election in Hong Kong is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Hong Kong residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates out of fear that China will scrap their democratic freedoms and legal system after Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. For the first time, Hong Kong's entire 60-seat Legislative Council (LegCo) was elected at one time. Pro-democratic forces now constitute a working majority, but Beijing has promised to dissolve the LegCo when it takes over Hong Kong's government.
<p>
	The British territory of Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997. The transfer from British to Chinese rule was agreed upon in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration,1 which provides autonomy to Hong Kong residents in local government, economic, social, and cultural affairs for at least fifty years after reversion. During this time, Hong Kong's government and courts are to remain intact, although China will assume control of Hong Kong's security and foreign affairs. The Basic Law,2 Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, mandates that China will refrain from imposing its socialist policies on Hong Kong and pledges to respect the Joint Declaration's guarantees of local government autonomy and an independent judiciary.
<p>
	Notwithstanding Beijing's assurances, America's political and economic interests in Hong Kong are significant and will endure. American corporations' multibillion-dollar investments and their use of Hong Kong as a regional operations center can continue only if Hong Kong remains as open and free as it is today.
<p>
	Hong Kong is America's 12th-largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion.3 The U.S. enjoys an annual trade surplus with Hong Kong of nearly $2 billion which is expected to rise as American technology and service-related industries commit themselves more deeply to the region and join the over 1,000 American businesses already there. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest outside of the U.S.
<p>
	American economic interests in Hong Kong are built on its respect for the rule of law, which serves as the guardian of economic and political freedom. The U.S. therefore has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Only if the rule of law continues can residents' freedom be protected and the economy continue to flourish.
<p>
	The United States has an interest in seeing both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law implemented. These instruments provide the framework for a smooth and comprehensive transfer of sovereignty in 1997. They guarantee that Hong Kong will remain not only a leading international business center, but also a free society. The critical conditions of the Basic Law that Beijing must respect after 1997 include:
<p><ul>
<li>Continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity;
<p>
<li>The existence of a free market;
<p>
<li>Commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press;
<p>
<li>Preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service;
<p>
<li>The rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties;
<p>
<li>Maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and
<p>
<li>Cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities.4</ul><p><b>THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL</b><p>	The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) will replace the United Kingdom's Privy Council as Hong Kong's final appeals court. On June 9, 1995, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, established in 1985 to implement the Joint Declaration, reached agreement on the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong.5 It is envisaged that the CFA will provide continuity in the rule of law.<p>	Supporters of the Court deal, most notably in Hong Kong's international business community, argue that it "sweeps away the uncertainty, for people and businesses, here and abroad, about a gap in the judicial system."6  Critics, such as Democratic Party leader Martin Lee and Hong Kong's Bar Association, accuse Britain of appeasing China.7 Lee condemns the agreement as the "final nail in Hong Kong's coffin."8<p>	This deal is not without shortcomings. Most disturbing is that the Court of Final Appeal will be established not before the 1997 reversion, but immediately after the transfer of government authority to Beijing.9 Therefore, the danger exists that Beijing will not permit a truly independent judiciary.10 The Basic Law, drafted and approved by China, stipulates that China's National People's Congress will retain control over "acts of state," or "affairs that are the responsibility of the Chinese government."  Beijing could exploit this language to reverse decisions reached by the Court of Final Appeal.<p><b>PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICAN INTERESTS</b>
<p>
	Against a backdrop of growing uncertainty over Hong Kong's future, Congress in October 1992 adopted the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, which defines America's economic, political, and human rights interests in Hong Kong and requires the State Department to report to Congress on these issues. The Act categorically states American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations after 1997 and asserts that the U.S. should regard Hong Kong as autonomous in all economic and trade matters.11 It also specifies that U.S. laws "shall continue to apply with respect to Hong Kong, on and after July 1, 1997... unless otherwise expressly provided by law or by Executive order."12<p>	Given continuing concerns over the fate of the recently elected Legislative Council, as well as over the future of democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong, the U.S. should work during the remaining months of this transitional period to support American interests and strengthen Hong Kong's ability to shape its own future. Thus, the Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Firmly support Hong Kong's free enterprise system.</b> Hong Kong symbolizes the free-market system. In a recent Heritage Foundation study, <a href="econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>The Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, Hong Kong far outstripped most of its competitors to place first in a global ranking of economic freedoms.13 But unless free-market policies and a strong, reliable system of dispute resolution continue after 1997, Hong Kong cannot retain its economic freedom and entrepreneurial dynamism. Should the rule of law be replaced by the rule of personal connections, which is often the practice in the PRC, Hong Kong's prosperity will be threatened.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China not to dismantle Hong Kong's Legislative Council.</b> The current Legislative Council, elected on September 17, 1995, should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term free of any disruption brought about by reversion to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing remains committed to nominating a provisional council to oversee Hong Kong after reversion. This would violate Beijing's commitment to non-interference in Hong Kong's affairs, sabotage international confidence in Hong Kong, and disappoint the expectations of its residents. The U.S. should communicate to China that a popularly supported legislative body is crucial to Hong Kong's future. The overwhelming victory won by pro-democracy candidates in the recent election emphasizes the need for LegCo's continued, uninterrupted existence.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S. Navy port calls to Hong Kong while not accepting a new Chinese consulate in Honolulu.</b> Hong Kong has been a free port for visits by 60 to 70 U.S. Navy ships a year. These visits should be continued. They demonstrate America's engagement in the region, support the American position in Hong Kong, and provide evidence of a stable relationship with the PRC. The U.S. Navy resumed port calls to the Chinese mainland earlier this year, showing a commitment to a better U.S.-China relationship and removing a key obstacle to continuation of port calls to Hong Kong. However, the U.S. should rebuff China's attempt to trade acceptance of American port calls in Hong Kong for establishment of a Chinese consulate in Honolulu. It clearly is not in America's interest to allow China an official presence in such a militarily sensitive area, from which it could monitor U.S. naval movements in the Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Speak out in favor of a professional, non-biased civil service in Hong Kong after 1997.</b> Hong Kong's professional civil service is regarded as one of the keys to the territory's success. Its ability to remain impartial and unbiased during the run-up to 1997 will ensure a smooth and stable transition, and its continued existence after reversion will enhance confidence in Hong Kong's future.
<p>
<li><b>Continue to support Hong Kong's participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership.</b> Hong Kong has played a valuable role in the World Trade Organization, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and other international organizations. Its membership in these organizations should continue after 1997. Hong Kong's autonomous voice in these organizations has opened the door for free-market reforms in China and throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Continue high-level visits to Hong Kong.</b> Visits of high-level Americans to Hong Kong after reversion would help cement the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral relationship and would provide an excellent forum in which the remaining agreements, including those on extradition and investment, can be established with the Hong Kong SAR after 1997. High-level visits also send a message to Beijing that Hong Kong is important to American interests throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China to protect human rights in Hong Kong.</b> The uncertainty over Hong Kong's future requires constant vigilance on the part of the international community. The United Nations requires the United Kingdom to report to the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee on Hong Kong's human rights record. But China is not a member of the committee, so these reports will end after the 1997 transfer. Because China remains unwilling to enter into the U.N. covenant on human rights, the U.S. should continue to press China either to enter into the covenant or to allow Hong Kong to enter and report on human rights after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Insist that U.S. law enforcement agreements with Hong Kong continue.</b> Cooperation between Hong Kong and American law enforcement agencies has been one of long-standing goodwill and mutual benefit. Washington should ask that this cooperation continue after 1997. An extradition agreement with the Hong Kong authorities is nearing completion and soon will be placed before the U.S. Senate for ratification. The U.S. has worked with mainland authorities to control illegal narcotics, money laundering, and organized crime. This cooperation not only should continue after reversion, but should be intensified.
<p>
<li><b>Complete negotiations on outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.</b>The three most important outstanding agreements involve extradition, civil aviation, and bilateral investment. The extradition agreement awaits final PRC approval within the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). A civil aviation agreement has not yet been reached, and no new negotiations are planned. Completion of the investment agreement is mired in questions of format. The U.S. has a standard draft that it wishes to advance, while Hong Kong has its own model text from which it wants to develop an agreement. Negotiations are scheduled for later this year. The U.S. should strive to complete these agreements as soon as possible. They would relax barriers to American business in the region, increase official interaction with Hong Kong, and help ensure Hong Kong's autonomy after 1997. Some were drafted directly with Hong Kong authorities, others with the United Kingdom under an "entrustment" clause. Under international law, the latter agreements will lapse upon Hong Kong's reversion in 1997. It is in the interests of both sides to see them replaced with a new agreement before such a lapse occurs.
<p>
<li><b>Encourage China to prepare a post-1997 travel document for Hong Kong residents.</b> Hong Kong's ability to remain a vibrant center of international commerce is only as strong as its residents' ability to travel abroad without undue interference. Without a document that allows them to travel abroad, Hong Kong's businessmen and women will lose to competitors, causing a natural erosion in the territory's competitive edge. Until the 1997 reversion, the U.S. should continue to recognize Hong Kong residents' British National Overseas (BNO) and British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports as legal travel documents. In the meantime, Washington should urge Beijing to prepare travel documents for Hong Kong residents that respect their right to travel freely. Such freedom is vital to the continuation of Hong Kong as a business center.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S.-sponsored international academic programs in Hong Kong.</b> The United States Information Agency's International Visitor Program, the Fulbright Program, and a host of unofficial academic exchanges strengthen American educational and cultural links to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has shown an interest in funding the development of a Hong Kong-American Center devoted to fostering academic ties. This effort should be encouraged by the U.S. It would increase American involvement after 1997 without adding significantly to U.S. government costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prevail upon Beijing to keep its promise of eventual universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</b>14 This promise was written into the Chinese-crafted Basic Law. If honored, it would provide a further measure of confidence in Beijing's willingness to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Furthermore, it would give residents of Hong Kong greater confidence in their ability to shape their own future. Failure to provide residents a say in their political system would cause the middle class to flee and dampen the enthusiasm felt by international businesses for Hong Kong.
<p>
<li><b>Maintain an active consulate general up to and after 1997.</b> The American diplomatic presence in Hong Kong should not be scaled back just to defer to Beijing's wishes. Given American economic interests and numerous bilateral programs, it is natural that the U.S. government should remain committed to operating in Hong Kong. America's Hong Kong policy should be run from Hong Kong, not from Beijing. Therefore, the U.S. should maintain a consulate office in Hong Kong after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Urge resolution of the dispute over Container Terminal 9.</b> The delay in construction of Container Terminal 9 (CT9), a major infrastructure project at the port of Hong Kong, directly affects American economic interests. It is key to Hong Kong's ability to compete as a regional shipping and business center. The U.S. stake in the project is significant because a major American firm, Sea-Land Services Inc., has based a large part of its presence in Asia on the project's completion. The U.S. should make it clear to both Britain and the PRC that resolution of this dispute, which arose mainly over inclusion of the British Jardines Matheson consortium, would benefit all parties and ease the shipping bottleneck that already threatens to blunt Hong Kong's competitive edge over other ports in the region.
</ul><p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Even in an area as economically vibrant as East Asia, Hong Kong stands out as a tremendous free-market success. Through its dynamism, free-market policies, entrepeneurship, and rule of law, Hong Kong has transformed itself into something much more than a successful economic center of six million people. It has become the focal point for social and economic development within China and in many ways is an inspiration to other countries in the region as well.
<p>
	All of this will be jeopardized if Beijing fails to honor its promises after 1997. China's threats to dismantle the LegCo and run Hong Kong as it sees fit have eroded confidence in Hong Kong's future. And because the fate of Hong Kong will continue to be a factor in shaping American views of China, erosion of faith in the U.S.-China relationship is inevitable if Beijing breaks its word.
<p>
	As this century draws to a close, China's emergence as a major global power will play a larger role in determining the American course of action in Asia. China's deeds and words carry growing weight. Its threats regarding Hong Kong's future autonomy, and the direct effect these threats have on American interests in Hong Kong, cannot be ignored. In addition to being an important economic interest of the United States, a prosperous and autonomous Hong Kong represents a test of China's intentions and behavior, both in Asia and in the rest of the world.

 <a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
In contrast to his mishandling of relations with Japan and China, President Bill Clinton advanced American interests in Asia with his July 11 executive order to establish formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Opening formal relations with Vietnam not only will allow the United States to increase trade with that country, but may in the long run encourage Vietnam to move away from Communism. A prosperous and free Vietnam could become a valuable friend in Asia for the United States. 
<p>
For this to occur, however, the Clinton Administration needs to fashion a strategy that goes beyond normalization and advances American interests in the region. Such a strategy should include continued efforts to resolve the disposition of Americans listed as missing in action during the war with Vietnam; promoting an expansion of economic freedom in Vietnam to allow for greater American trade and investment; promoting political freedom by helping Vietnam evolve from its communist political system; and supporting democratic reform in Cambodia as an example for Vietnam's future.
<p>
<a name="norm"><h4>WHY NORMALIZATION BENEFITS AMERICA </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
While establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam is discomforting to many Americans, doing so now advances American goals in Asia. First, it acknowledges that Vietnam has taken concrete steps to respond to the "roadmap" for normalization outlined by President George Bush in 1991. These include offering assistance, beginning in 1988, in resolving the fate of over 1,618 Americans listed as missing in action during the war; the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia in 1989; and the settlement of American property claims in 1994. Normalization at this time also sends an important message to China and North Korea: Relations with the U.S. can improve if a country stops threatening its neighbors and satisfies American concerns. 
<p>
Second, a formal relationship with Vietnam will enable the United States to pursue its economic interests in expanding trade and investment opportunities for American business. Vietnam's market of 70 million consumers remains highly underdeveloped, but economic reforms begun in 1989 are rapidly opening the Southeast Asian country to global commerce. Vietnam may spend an estimated $7 billion on infrastructure projects over the next five years. American brands, technology, and expertise are in demand. Of the $14 billion that other countries have invested in Vietnam, the U.S. accounts for the eighth largest share. About 300 American companies have opened offices in Vietnam since the 1994 lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Now that diplomatic relations have been established, the process of granting most-favored-nation trading status will begin. This process will offer the United States opportunities to convince Vietnam to increase economic freedom by reducing barriers to trade and investment.
<p>
Third, a normal relationship will enable the U.S. to advance its concerns about the status of human rights in Vietnam and eventually to support Vietnamese who may press for greater political freedoms. Vietnam's communist regime wants to promote economic growth and suppress political freedom. As has been the experience with other communist regimes, this is very difficult to sustain in the long term. Vietnam also may learn that totalitarian or even authoritarian control is incompatible with economic growth.
<p>
<a name="strat"><h4>A STRATEGY FOR FUTURE RELATIONS </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Future relations with Vietnam will present major challenges for American policy. The Hanoi regime has proven to be tenacious and stubborn in war and peace; future relations may entail considerable friction. Washington must craft a long-term strategy to advance U.S. economic and political goals with Vietnam while realizing that their attainment may take many years. Such a strategy should include:
<p>
<a name="reso"><b>Resolving the MIA question.</b></a><br>
Washington should tell Hanoi that it must continue to cooperate to the maximum extent possible in resolving the question of American servicemen missing from the war. This is a humanitarian concern that transcends all other issues in the relationship. Of the 2,202 Americans missing from the war, 1,618 were lost in Vietnam. This year the U.S. Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, which is leading the effort to investigate the fate of MIAs and recover their remains, will spend about $100 million. This effort should be continued. Despite increased cooperation by Hanoi in recent years, Hanoi's actions over the history of the MIA issue fuel continued suspicion that it has not divulged all relevant information. Washington should continue to press Hanoi and Moscow -- Hanoi's former ally -- to release all relevant records, including internal government documents, pertaining to missing Americans. 
<p>
<a name="expa"><b>Expanding economic freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should use every opportunity to encourage Vietnam's leaders to expand economic freedom. Only greater economic freedom will sustain Vietnam's economic growth. As recently as 1978, Vietnam tried to abolish private enterprise; but in 1986, out of grave necessity, it embarked on a market reform program. The reforms proved effective, reversing chronic food shortages and leading to greater openness to foreign investment. However, Vietnam still maintains many barriers to trade and investment that must be addressed as the United States considers not only conferring most-favored-nation trade status, but whether to admit Vietnam to the World Trade Organization. Vietnam has only 6,300 private enterprises, and all but two percent of foreign joint ventures are contracted with state-owned firms. Investors face daunting barriers: arbitrary laws and regulations, a ponderously slow bureaucracy, and pervasive corruption. In the Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom,</i> Vietnam ranks number 99 in economic freedoms out of 101 countries surveyed. As a consequence, most Vietnamese are very poor; average per capita annual income is about $200. 
<p>
Vietnam will join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this month. ASEAN (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), formed in 1967 in part to oppose communist expansion, now promotes the common political and economic interests of its members. Vietnam wants to join an impending ASEAN Free Trade Area, which will require Hanoi to lower tariffs to 5 percent by the year 2007. While welcoming Vietnam's intention to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area, Washington should press Hanoi to make trade and investment rules more transparent, simplify investment procedures, rapidly privatize state-owned enterprises, and accelerate tariff reductions. 
<p>
<a name="prpo"><b>Promoting political freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should begin a campaign to promote political freedom in Vietnam. Vietnamese themselves inevitably will demand such freedom as a consequence of economic growth, greater contact with foreigners, and Vietnamese exiles' returning to do business. Today, however, the Vietnamese Communist Party insists on total control of political power. There is no rule of law, no freedom to oppose the government, no free press, no freedom of assembly, and the government closely monitors religious groups. Dissidents are regularly jailed. 
<p>
After attending the annual ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers at the end of July, Secretary of State Warren Christopher intends to visit Hanoi. Christopher should begin a dialogue with Vietnamese officials at the ASEAN meeting, to be continued in Hanoi, urging greater tolerance of political freedom. In future meetings, U.S. officials should tell their Vietnamese counterparts that they will not be able fully to join Asia's rapid economic growth until economic liberalization incorporates greater political freedom.
<p>
Washington should move cautiously in developing any strategic relationship with Hanoi. While the United States and Vietnam oppose China's territorial claims to the South China Sea, the U.S. should resist the temptation to build up Vietnam as a counter to China. Vietnam and China will remain traditional adversaries regardless of the extent of U.S.-Vietnamese ties. Potential U.S.-Vietnam military cooperation could suffer the same fate as U.S.-China military relations: military ties built during the 1980s to counter the Soviet Union were dashed in 1989 over human rights issues. U.S.-Vietnamese military-to-military contacts already are extensive over the MIA issue. Today, however, Vietnam has closer political relations with Cuba and Iraq than with the United States. A useful military relationship with Vietnam may not be possible until it evolves significantly away from communism. 
<p>
<a name="prfe"><b>Promoting freedom in Cambodia.</b></a><br>
To provide a positive example of life after communism for Vietnam's leaders, the U.S. should work to consolidate Cambodia's tentative transition from communist rule to democracy, and to promote sustained economic growth. Vietnam put the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in power after its military occupation of Cambodia in 1979. In 1993 the CPP lost United Nations-sponsored elections, but today the CPP dominates a coalition government in Cambodia. Washington should strongly urge the CPP-dominated government to resist such authoritarian measures as a pending law that threatens to curb press freedoms and cease measures to suppress opposition politicians like Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy. 
<p>
<a name="conc"><h4>CONCLUSION </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Normal relations with Vietnam will disappoint many Americans, especially those who made great sacrifices during the war and believe that Vietnam's communist regime was and remains untrustworthy. Yet twenty years after America's withdrawal from South Vietnam, it is becoming clear that America's sacrifice -- including the lives of 58,128 servicemen -- was not in vain. The Hanoi regime's totalitarian control is eroding as it surrenders power out of necessity to capitalist forces of trade and foreign investment. 
<p>
The United States must plan to promote not only economic freedom in Vietnam, but political freedom as well. This process may take many years and cause great friction with Vietnam. But there are better prospects now to realize America's original goal: a free Vietnam that becomes a valued economic and political partner in Asia. If this occurs, the Vietnam War may turn out to have been only a lost battle. The forces of freedom and democracy for which America fought will prevail.

<P><h2><center>
NEW ZEALAND: A BLUEPRINT FOR ECONOMIC REFORM</h2></center><p>

Delivered June 16, 1995 by His Excellency John Wood, Ambassador of New Zealand to the United States. 
<P>
	I had hoped to talk to you this afternoon about the America's Cup. But my staff have told me that I've done that subject to death, that Americans don't really want to hear any more about New Zealand winning yachting's greatest prize, and that I might actually get a better reception at The Heritage Foundation for one of my other favorite topics -- farming without subsidies.
<p>
	Actually, today I'd like to talk to you about the economic transformation of New Zealand that has occurred over the last decade.
<p>
	New Zealand at the time of the Korean War was among the five wealthiest countries in the world. By the late '70s, we had fallen to near 20th. New Zealand had one of the poorest performing economies of the Western world; had not dealt well with the oil shocks; had high tariff and other import barriers, high levels of farm subsidies, a national debt that was approaching Third World proportions, a top tax rate of 66 percent; a gold-plated welfare system that the country could no longer afford. From 1975 to 1983, the economy barely grew; the only thing that grew was unemployment -- from 0 percent to 5 percent. 
<p>
	In other words, we were as tightly regulated, protected, and centralized as any East European country, and performing about as well. If we'd been a company, we would have been bankrupt, or at the least operating under Chapter 11!
<p>
	In 1984 a period of reform started which has been described by the OECD as the most comprehensive undertaken by any Western country in recent decades. I've said a little bit about how we got into the mess. How did we get out of it?  What are the results today?
<p>

<b>PRECONDITIONS FOR REFORM</b><p>
	There were three critical preconditions for reform:
<P>
First, in 1984 there was an acute sense of crisis in the country at large.
<p>
Second, there was a consensus among New Zealand's professional leadership, both public and private sector, that drastic and comprehensive change was necessary, that no single interest group should be immune from change or should be permitted to dictate the agenda. An intellectual basis for change was provided by a key group of officials in the Treasury, drawing in part on their exposure to academic debate in the United States. A change of government in 1984 brought to power a Labor government that was a generation younger than its predecessor, of liberal persuasion and professional background, and willing to embrace change. They took the view that ideas, productive energies, and confidence for New Zealand to make its way in the world would only emerge from opening all sectors of the economy to the forces of competition.
<P>
Third, there was a realization that no one else was going to help us. There was no fairy godmother out there willing and able to shore up our currency, extend our debt raising capacity, or anything else. We were in trouble, in part of our own making. We had to get out of it ourselves.

<P>
<b>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?<br></b><p>
<b>Financial Sector
</B><p>
	The foreign exchange crisis at the time of the change of government led to a decision to massively devalue the currency, then free float the exchange rate, and then to comprehensively deregulate the financial sector. With foreign exchange controls lifted, new banks were allowed to operate.
<p>

<b>Agriculture</b>
<P>
	Let me spend a little time here even though I appreciate that I may be speaking to the converted, given the position that has been taken in The Heritage Foundation's publications. But let me explain how we got rid of the sacred cows -- not the other ones, but the sacred ones.
<P>
	Farm production and processing account for nearly 12 percent of New Zealand's GDP. Two-thirds of total farm output is exported, earning 60 percent of total export revenue. Agriculture is too big to be carried by the rest of the economy. Assistance to New Zealand's farmers peaked in 1984, contributing to 30 percent of total agricultural output. That was  unsustainable. One year later, almost all subsidies were gone, and the rest went soon after.
<P>
	There are now no subsidies and no other forms of assistance except for spending on inspection, quarantine, research, and pest control. New Zealand's farmers are fully exposed to market forces. New Zealand's agricultural sector is by far the least assisted in the OECD. Government support to farming fell from a peak of 30 percent in 1984 to 3 percent in 1990.
<P>
	It was not a painless process. Market land values fell by 22 percent during 1982-1988 (indicating the extent to which government support for agriculture was capitalized into farm land values). Overseas markets worsened in the late 1980s, mostly due to the subsidized overproduction of pastoral products in OECD countries.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the main farmers organization supported the reforms (provided they were implemented throughout the economy, thus lowering farmers' costs of production). Farmers adjusted rapidly to liberalization. Very few were forced out -- only about 800, or 1 percent. Farming contracted at the margins (marginal land use, excessive debt loads, and/or incompetence), not across the board. Lurid depictions of rural collapse never became a reality.
<P>
	Now farmers' real net incomes have returned to the level prevailing in the early 1980s. Farmers have become more innovative and more responsive to markets and allocate their  resources more efficiently. They have developed new markets.
<P>
	Some in the U.S. have suggested that there was a drop in agricultural output. That is misleading. The pattern of farm output changed, reflecting more efficient allocation of resources. For example, there was a trend away from traditional pastoral farming, where most subsidies were once directed (sheep numbers fell from 70 million in 1982 to 50 million today) into a range of areas such as horticulture, forestry, and cattle.
<P>
	No New Zealand farmers are calling for a return to the bad old days of government support. New Zealand farmers earn their living by their own efforts, without interference. That independence is now fiercely defended by rural people. New Zealand's experience shows that it is possible for farmers to live well and prosper following the loss of government assistance despite the agricultural support policies of other countries, including the U.S., which distort and limit international trade.
<P><b>Trade</b><P>
	Tariffs in New Zealand were reduced to one-third of what they had previously been. New Zealand consciously opened up its market to imports and international competition. Even after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, New Zealand unilaterally announced a further series of tariff reductions up to the year 2000 in areas as sensitive as textiles, clothing, and footwear. Over 90 percent of all imports now enter New Zealand free of any quota, duty, or other restriction. In the meantime, New Zealand's manufacturing base has flourished. Our total exports of all goods increased 5 percent in 1994; manufactured goods increased by 7 percent. I know this kind of action is commonly referred to as unilateral disarmament in this country. We simply don't see it that way. We weren't seeking to convey unrequited benefits to anyone else, but to do ourselves a favor.
<P>

<b>Market Reforms</b>
	The public sector in New Zealand used to run everything from the railways to electricity generation, the telecommunications sector, a savings bank, the coal mines. The government used to build all the roads and dams. Some estimates suggest that the government was involved in 60 percent of the economy, certainly in almost all major investment decisions.
<P>
	In 1984, the government adopted the principle that the state should not be involved in any activities that could be more efficiently and effectively run by the private sector. The first step was corporatization through the State Owned Enterprises Act of 1986, which involved getting enterprises run on a commercial basis, freeing them from government red tape, putting a private sector board in charge, removing political interference, requiring them to make a profit. This often meant setting clear, unambiguous goals. For example, the Forest Service was never sure whether its main purpose was to plant and harvest trees profitably or to provide jobs. Corporatization removed that conflict.
<P>
	The second step was privatization, or selling the enterprise and removing the government as an owner. An important principle that was at the heart of the privatization process was minimum regulation but maximum competition. There was no desire to substitute private sector monopoly for government monopoly. The government therefore sought to put in place a framework that would generate competition.
<P>
	One of the best examples is in the field of telecommunications, with corporatization in 1987 and privatization in 1990. The proceeds of NZ$4.250 billion were used to retire the debt. Telecom New Zealand had 26,500 employees; it now has 9,300. There is competition from MCI on long distance, from Bell South on cellular. Capital investment of nearly NZ$5 billion since 1987 was not paid by the taxpayers. In addition, Telecom New Zealand paid $463 million in taxes in the last three years. From antiquated technology to a 97 percent digital system rated second in the World Competitiveness Report (an independent Swiss-based organization) for telecom systems, and from being a drain on the taxpayer, our telecommunications system has become a significant force in an expanding economy that  actually contributes to government revenue through taxation.
<P>
	The Coal Corporation had had losses in 20 of the previous 22 years. In its first year of   corporatization, it increased its level of production while cutting staff numbers in half. And it made a profit. Now while there are fewer workers, they are better paid -- and they have a  future.
<P>
	Since 1987 21 former State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been sold, generating NZ$12.8 billion, which has been used to repay debt. Some SOEs remain, some possibly to be privatized (for example, Forestcorp). Others may not (for example, Airways Corp, responsible for air safety, with a profit of NZ$6 million last year, or the New Zealand Post, with very large profits, improved services, and a basic postage stamp rate that has not increased in many years).
<P>

<b>Public Sector Reform</b><P>
	One statistic that gives an idea of the scale of change in the public sector is that it decreased in size from 88,000 people employed in public service in 1984 to 36,000 ten years later:  a reduction of 59 percent.
<P>
	How did we do it?  We made managers fully accountable. For example, permanent heads became CEOs on five-year contracts. They contracted with Ministers to provide certain   outputs. We freed up central controls on finance and personnel policies. We let managers set pay and conditions and use capital to the best advantage. Departments can buy and sell assets within their existing level of appropriation without any further appropriation or authority.
<P>
	We introduced accrual accounting (it was a bit of a shock to find the government's net worth in FY 1992/93 was negative NZ$7.7 billion). We are the only Western government to produce its national accounts in this way, which gives a clear idea of the unfunded liabilities of the government. A capital charge on each department's capital has meant departments no longer regard capital as a free good and leads to much more sensible use of assets, akin to the way a private company would behave.
<P>
	In sum, three key aspects of the government reforms have been very successful:
<p><ol><li>Transparency in the activities and processes of the government;
<li>The liberation of managers from central input controls;
<li>The new financial management and accounting systems.
<P>
<b>LOCKING IN THE REFORMS</b><P>
	The reform process took place under two different governments in New Zealand. From 1984-1990, there was a Labor government; from 1990 onwards, a National government. The National government took up the reform process from Labor and reformed the Labor market. The Employment Contracts Act provided for comprehensive deregulation, employees not being required to join any union, and few external legal constraints other than contract law and minimum standards. National also reformed the welfare system. It reduced the value of government benefits and targeted them more precisely, including means testing to ensure assistance was directed to those most in need.
<P>
	Both parties took steps to ensure that in the future, economic management would be as divorced from politics as possible.
<p>
	The Reserve Bank Act 1989 enhanced the independence of the Reserve Bank and stipulated that the bank's main function, for which the Governor would be held personally responsible, was maintenance of price stability within 0-2 percent.
<P>
	The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994 requires all of the government's financial reporting to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. The government is required to set medium term objectives, which at present are reducing net debt to between 20 percent-30 percent of GDP, restoring the government's net worth to positive levels, reducing government expenditure to below 30 percent of GDP, not increasing the rate of income tax, and prudently managing risks facing the government. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the government must publish a comprehensive set of accounts annually and before any election.
<P>
<b>RESULTS OF TEN YEARS OF REFORM</b><P>
	In 1994 New Zealand was ranked ninth overall amongst the OECD in the World Competitiveness Report. It ranked first in the world for government policy designed to develop a competitive business environment.
<P>
	After years of low to mediocre growth, New Zealand's economy has grown over the last two years by 5 percent, with growth at times exceeding 6 percent. We believe this is on a sustainable basis. Our mid-term expectation is for between 3.5 percent and 5 percent growth. Inflation has been held below 2 percent -- the second-lowest rate in the OECD.
<P>
	For two years running, the government has balanced its budget. In 1984 the deficit was 9 percent of GDP. This year we expect the surplus will be over 4 percent of GDP (NZ$2.6  billion), rising to 7.5 percent by 1997. Public debt as a share of GDP was nearly 52 percent of GDP at 30 June 1992, is currently 38 percent, and is projected to be down to 18 percent by 1998. Net foreign currency debt will be totally paid off by 30 June 1997.
<P>
	Government spending as a percentage of GDP -- 41 percent in 1991 -- is 34 percent this year, and we aim to have it below 30 percent. Despite this reduction in government spending as a percentage of GDP, expenditure on education overall has been increasing steadily. It was the top expenditure priority in the budget just recently announced. It is now over 5 percent of GDP, above that in the U.K., Australia, and the United States.
<P>
	When accrual accounting was introduced, we discovered the government's net worth in 1992/93 was negative $7.7 billion. By next financial year we expect it to be positive. Unemployment has fallen from a high of 10.9 percent to 6.6 percent, with excellent employment growth in last two years.
<P>
	But even more than these economic statistics, the process of reform, which has not been without pain for many New Zealanders, has now led to a new spirit of self-confidence in the country and a feeling that New Zealand has positioned itself to compete in the global environment. We are now free traders par excellence. We have the cleanest and most comprehensive free trade area in the world, with Australia. We are talking to Chileans. We are exploring a link between the Australia/New Zealand Free Trade Area and ASEAN. We would be delighted to talk free trade with any other economies in the Asia/Pacific region.
<P>
	I hope you will all come down to New Zealand to see for yourselves. New Zealand is not just a pretty place to visit, but also a very stimulating environment. Whilst we do not pretend that there are necessarily any lessons from what has happened in New Zealand for other countries, we are always happy to share experiences with our friends. Come down and see us defend the America's Cup!

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIA-U.S. RELATIONS</h2></center><p>
Delivered May 24, 1995 by Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Minister of External Affairs of India
<p>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, I am aware of the importance of The Heritage Foundation in shaping ideas and attitudes in this great country. At a time when our own dialogue with the United States has begun to broaden and deepen, I knew that if I could take the message of the great changes that are occurring in India to the Foundation I could be sure of it reaching those in this country who are interested in knowing about India. My message is about the modernization and reforms that are sweeping throughout our country and the groundwork that is being laid for building strong relations with the outside world, especially with the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Shared Values: Democracy<p></B>
	The people of India and the U.S. are alike in the most fundamental of ways. We are democracies, ruled by the will of the people. The United States is one of the oldest democracies in the world and India the largest. In India, we are particularly proud that our system successfully allows us to mediate the sometimes conflicting interests of our 870 million people. We have repeatedly demonstrated the resilience of our democratic process. We have experienced peaceful and orderly transition of governments and have maintained effective unity in diversity. We face the future with the confidence that our democratic system will be equal to all the challenges it may have to face. If we in India have adjusted better than have many other countries to radical transformation, one of the reasons is that our democratic institutions ensured that the market system and free enterprise flourished even when a strong public sector ruled the commanding heights of our economy.
<p>
<b>Economic Reforms</B><P>
	India's reforms have been aimed at invigorating our economy by liberalization and industrialization, which have had the effect of enhancing competition. The role of the public sector in our economy has been reduced by design, and more stringent accountability has been instituted. Though I am also the Planning Minister, let me confide that the balance between central planning and market-driven investment in our economy is shifting markedly towards the latter. Barriers to foreign participation in India's economy have disappeared in a large number of cases. We realize that our future growth and prosperity can be accomplished best by integrating with the global economy and that if we are to become a global player, our products have to measure up to global standards.
<P>
	The results of these reforms are impressive. Last year the economy grew by 5.3 percent. According to our projection, a similar target will be achieved next year, but I find that a U.S. group of experts has a more optimistic expectation and anticipates that the figure for next year may be 6.3 or 6.4 percent. Industrial growth was almost 9 percent. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up from $1 billion in July 1991 to $21 billion today. Food reserves are at a record high of 30 million tons. Our exports are growing at the rate of about 20 percent in  dollar terms. Inflation has declined sharply in the last few months. Investment offers, direct or indirect, which were under $200 million until only three years ago, are of the order of $4 to $5 billion in the past two years. All in all, the Indian economy is today poised for a sustained growth of 6 to 6.5 percent between now and the year 2000.
<P>
	In implementing our reforms, we have attempted to maintain a political consensus behind them in the country, avoid shock therapy and overheating, and deliberately and carefully sequence the reform process so as to minimize social pain and develop stable markets. We certainly intend to stay the course we have set for ourselves.
<P>
	Our approach has undoubtedly succeeded so far, as borne out by the enthusiastic response received from foreign investors, in particular those from this country. The United States has now become our largest source of foreign investment, with almost 40 percent of approved new investment originating from the U.S. The enlargement of our economic ties is dramatically illustrated by the fact that, in 1993 alone, U.S. firms invested more in India than in the previous 45 years of our relationship. The U.S. is also now our number one trading partner, with an estimated $7.6 billion in goods and services exchanged in 1994. It accounts for 18 percent of our exports and 20 percent of our imports.
<P>
	We are encouraged by the identification of India by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown as "one of the ten most exciting emerging markets in the world."  During Secretary Brown's recent visit to India, business deals of around $7.7 billion were signed. This, plus the $10 million business tie-ups in the energy sector firmed up during Secretary O'Leary's two visits, underscores the enormous opportunities for business and investment in India for U.S. companies.
<P>

<b>Multilateralism in World Trade</b><P>
	In the more economically integrated world ahead of us, it is important that all countries, in particular major trading countries like the U.S., act to strengthen the multilateral trading system. The Uruguay Round has given us an effective framework in the World Trade Organization. On our part we intend to abide fully by the obligations assumed by us as part of the multilateral agreements adopted in Marrakesh. A strong multilateral framework, such as we have established in the WTO, is our best guarantee for continued growth of world trade and prosperity. As we liberalize and reform the Indian economy, this is of vital concern to us. While we can sympathize with the impulses that animate America in controlling what it regards as restrictive trading practices, we do not believe that unilateral measures are the answer. The last thing we wish to see is a trade war between major trading nations, as that is bound to affect our interests adversely.
<P>

<B>Indian Americans</b><P>
	There are around 800,000 people from India in this country, according to the U.S. 1990 census, who have made the U.S. their home. These Indian Americans have made a signal contribution to American society. They have also demonstrated how the values they brought with them from India -- the ideals of family and education, for example -- can help overcome almost any barrier in this land of opportunity. We take pride in the fact that this community has done so well. They form a vested interest in good relations between the U.S. and India. At one stage, we used to fret about the "brain drain" which brought tens of thousands of highly skilled young persons from our country to the U.S.A. and other Western countries. We may still feel the loss in some respects, but we are now able to regard Indians abroad as a resource for the mother country, creating goodwill for India, providing a bridge between the two countries and a source of expertise and capital for the development of India.
<P>

<B>Terrorism</B><P>
	The end of the Cold War has considerably eased the global security situation. But not all regions of the world have benefitted from reduction of tensions. The end of the Cold War has spawned new threats and dangers to the stability of individual states. Ethnic conflicts have sharpened and international terrorism become more widespread. The Oklahoma bombing has brought home dramatically to the American people the human tragedy that is caused by mindless terrorist violence. What you have suffered at Oklahoma City and earlier at the World Trade Center, we in India have suffered in much more virulent form for over a decade in both Punjab and Kashmir. The Bombay blast in March 1993 constituted the biggest single act of urban terrorism in history, causing over 300 deaths and injuries to over 1,000 people. Just a few days ago in Kashmir, the terrorist organizations, the Harkat ul Ansar and Hizbul Mujahideen, burnt down a four and a half century-old religious shrine on the day of the holy Muslim festival of Id-ul-Zuha in a cynical bid to stoke religious fires. The international community needs to join hands to combat the mounting menace of international terrorism and break its close linkage with the narcotics trade. We find it particularly reprehensible that terrorist organizations should be used to subvert legitimately appointed governments and to promote territorial claims on behalf of their sponsors.
<P>

<B>South Asia</b><P>
	We are strongly committed to setting up a structure of durable peace in the subcontinent. There are many problems in our region, but we seek to address them through dialogue and peaceful means. Ultimately, peace is the best guarantee for the security of any country. Global and regional peace and stability provide the best bulwark for a nation's defense. With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, India enjoys good friendly and cordial relations. We are constructively engaged in steps to improve our relations with China and have made significant progress in recent times. Unfortunately, with Pakistan we continue to have serious difficulties. Despite our best efforts to engage Pakistan in a serious bilateral dialogue to find solutions to all outstanding issues between us, we have failed to persuade them so far. The 1972 Simla Agreement provides a mutually agreed framework to settle our differences, but Pakistan regrettably has rejected all our calls for a dialogue without preconditions, with or without agenda, at any place of their choice, whether in India or Pakistan.
<P>
	The SAARC Summit earlier this month provided a useful opportunity for Prime Minister Rao and President Leghari of Pakistan to have an exchange of views. We hope that Pakistan will see reason and accept the fundamental proposition that, as two neighbors, we have a lot to gain if we are friends and a lot to lose if we do not make a serious search for realistic solutions to our problems. We may not be able to solve all our problems at one go, but dialogue will permit us to make a start. Let me add that we have no plan or intention to stoke tensions in the region or in any way to threaten regional peace.
<P>

<B>Non-Proliferation</b><P>
	India has faced four major aggressions across our borders since independence. Nuclear weapons and missiles are all around us. Our defense needs are large, but our means to fulfil them are limited. We feel accordingly that our security is best met through progressive global measures for disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  In 1954 we took the lead by introducing a resolution in the United Nations for a complete halt to nuclear testing. In the early 1980s, along with other countries, India had proposed a global convention to cut off all production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. These proposals figured again in the 1988 Action Plan on Nuclear Disarmament proposed by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the third Special Session on Disarmament, which still merits attention as a well thought out and practical program for universal disarmament.
<P>
	The end of the Cold War has created conditions for implementing these proposals. India and the United States are actively cooperating in the U.N. towards this objective. But these are only intermediate steps. Our goal should be to deal with nuclear weapons in the same way as the international community has dealt with the questions of chemical weapons and biological weapons. Our Prime Minister and President Clinton have jointly endorsed the objectives of eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons.
<P>
	India has always adopted a cautious and measured approach in building up its own defense capabilities. Our current expenditures, at around 2.5 percent of the GNP, are far less than those of our neighbors. We have no aggressive aims against others. We covet no nation's territory. We would have preferred to devote all our energies towards economic development. However, our experience of facing repeated aggression has shown that an adequate defense capacity is unavoidable. For all this, however, let me say that the talk one hears, especially in the West, about a nuclear showdown in South Asia is rather farfetched, if not altogether fanciful.
<P>

<B>Conclusion</b><p>
	I hope I have been able to convey a sense of the many things that we share with you. Let me conclude by reiterating what our Prime Minister said last year, in his address to the U.S. Congress:  "Indo-U.S. relations are on the threshold of a bold new era."  The pace at which Indo-U.S. relations have developed and expanded in the past year demonstrates that we have already entered that era. I have no doubt that the new Indo-U.S. partnership we are forging will go from strength to strength.

Nuclear Deal With Pyongyang: Roadmap to Progress or Dead End Street?"

<P>


       The Agreed Framework signed by the United States and communist 
North Korea last October aims to freeze and ultimately dismantle the 
Pyongyang regime's menacing nuclear weapons development program.  The 
Clinton Administration concedes that North Korea already may have 
constructed one or two nuclear weapons. A North Korean nuclear weapons 
program violates two major international agreements: the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which Pyongyang signed in 1985, and the 
Non-Nuclear Declaration inked with Seoul in 1992.  America's ally, 
South Korea, has complied faithfully with both agreements.
<P>
       Over the six months since the Framework was signed in Geneva in 
late October, the North on several occasions has acted in ways that 
call into question its commitment to the agreement and to easing 
tensions both with the U.S. and with South Korea. On December 17, 
1994, the North downed a U.S. helicopter that strayed into its 
territory, killing one U.S. serviceman and detaining another on false 
charges of espionage.  Fuel oil given to the North by the U.S. in 
February was diverted for military purposes in violation of the Geneva 
agreement.  On April 20, U.S.-North Korean talks broke down after 
Pyongyang refused to accept commitments it had made earlier to allow 
South Korean participation in implementing the Agreed Framework.
<P>
       Still, the North has lived up to its promise to "freeze" its 
nuclear program.  Thus, for now, the Administration's efforts deserve 
support and encouragement.  Further negotiations will confirm whether 
Pyongyang is willing to abide by the full scope of its obligations 
under the Geneva accord.  
<P>
A Generous Package for the North
<P>
       The U.S.-North Korea deal created the Korean Peninsula Economic 
Development Organization (KEDO), a consortium of nations led primarily 
by the U.S., South Korea, and Japan.  KEDO is responsible for 
constructing two light water reactors for the North that would be less 
capable of producing weapons-grade fuel than Pyongyang's existing 
technology.  The construction project's price tag is estimated 
conservatively at about $4.5 billion, with South Korea playing the 
"central" role in financing the project and Japan promising to make a 
"significant" contribution.  It generally is expected that Seoul will 
pay about half of this bill.
<P>
       The same consortium will assist North Korea's faltering economy 
by providing very large quantities of fuel oil. Moreover, Washington 
is easing its long-standing trade embargo on North Korea and will 
advance toward diplomatic relations with the North. The first step 
would be the exchange of "liaison offices." Japan also has resumed 
normalization talks with Pyongyang.
<P>
       In return, the North has agreed to "freeze" its nuclear program 
and to allow limited scrutiny by the United Nations' International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This prevents the North from taking 
additional steps to reprocess spent reactor fuel for bomb-making 
purposes. The North also has pledged to move its large cache of spent 
fuel rods out of the country and to permit the IAEA finally to perform 
"special inspections." These inspections would give the U.N. body a 
reliable estimate of the North's bomb-making capabilities. However, 
these pledges would not be fulfilled until delivery of key nuclear 
components to North Korea for completion of its first reactor. This 
could take five years.
<P>
        In the final stage of the deal, once both reactors have been 
completed, the North promises to dismantle all of its nuclear 
facilities that exist today. According to Clinton Administration 
estimates, this dismantling will not begin for at least ten years.
<P>
Pyongyang's Drive to Isolate Seoul
<P>
       Under the Geneva agreement, the U.S. and North Korea pledged to 
"make best efforts" to conclude negotiations on a reactor supply 
contract within six months. The contract was to outline the details of 
the massive construction project.  When Washington and Pyongyang 
signed the deal on October 21, 1994, the North's negotiators made a 
verbal commitment to accept South Korean-manufactured reactors. Since 
Seoul will be paying the lion's share of the project's bill, it 
understandably has been tapped by KEDO as the central player in the 
project.  Seoul expects to act as the prime contractor in the reactor 
construction.
<P>
       However, talks between the U.S. and the North in Berlin broke 
down on April 20, one day before the contract target date. Pyongyang 
reneged on its earlier commitment to accept South Korean reactors.  It 
also opposed Seoul's central role in KEDO.  Senior Republic of Korea 
government officials have made it clear that, if the North refuses 
Seoul's active involvement in the project, the South will not provide 
financial backing.  Since no other nation will come up woth several 
billion dollars in Seoul's stead, the project cannot proceed without 
South Korean participation.
<P>
       In response, the Clinton Administration has proposed that the 
U.S. and North Korea resume high-level political talks in Geneva in 
hopes of reaching an agreement on the important reactor project supply 
contract. This is a prudent signal to the North and the international 
community that Washington remains open to dialogue.  Still, the 
Administration should draw the line at offering any compromise on the 
key issue of South Korean participation. Clearly, Pyongyang seeks to 
isolate Seoul and strengthen its bilateral relations with the U.S.  
South Koreans have expressed their concern that the North has gained 
politically in its dealings with Washington while Seoul appears at 
times to be marginalized.  Seoul has no official place at the Agreed 
Framework bargaining table.
<P>
Policy Options for the Future
<P>
       Recent talks over the reactor supply contract represent an 
important milestone in the implementation of the Agreed Framework.  
The North's willingness to fulfill all of its commitments under the 
deal should be tested early on.  Pyongyang should be pressed to accept 
the requirements regarding South Korea's reactors and Seoul's central 
role in KEDO.  The U.S. must be prepared to stand firm and avoid 
further concessions to the North.  To its credit, the Clinton 
Administration did this in a united front with Seoul during the April 
Berlin talks when it resisted the North's demands.  This was a wise 
and prudent use of the leverage the U.S. now has with Pyongyang, for 
the North stands to reap generous political and economic benefits from 
the agreement. Looking to the future, a consistently strong show of 
American determination is in order.  Past experience indicates that 
the North will behave responsibly only to the extent that Washington 
follows a firm, steady course.
<P>
       If implementation of the framework is hampered by stalemated 
talks with Pyongyang, the U.S. should maintain a strong and principled 
posture until the North drops its unreasonable positions.  Progress 
toward the exchange of liaison offices should be slowed, as should the 
movement toward North Korea-Japan normalization that began in March.  
Similarly, trade benefits under the agreements should be curtailed.  
These actions will be painful for Pyongyang in view of its 
deteriorating economy and diplomatic isolation.  
<P>
       It is also important that the U.S. press the North to resume 
talks with Seoul. The nuclear program is but one threat to peace on 
the Korean Peninsula.  A high state of tension exists between the 
North and South.  Pyongyang maintains a massive military force, which 
includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. The 
hostile North Korean regime threatens stability in Northeast Asia, and 
the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are in harm's way.  
American vital interests would be served by reducing inter-Korean 
tension. The Agreed Framework includes a commitment by Pyongyang to 
resume productive dialogue with Seoul, but it has refused to do so.  
The U.S., in close consultation with Seoul, must press Pyongyang to 
restart long-stalled North-South talks.  Ultimately, the path to 
Korean peace and reunification runs not between the U.S. and North 
Korea, but between Seoul and Pyongyang. 
<P>
U.S. Policy for the "Worst Case"
<P>
       The "worst case" scenario is one in which the North breaches 
the agreement by restarting its reactor or resuming fuel reprocessing.  
In this event, the Clinton Administration has made it clear that the 
Framework would be pronounced null and void by Washington. Steps then 
should be taken by the U.S., but not steps that would fuel a crisis 
atmosphere.  The North often has operated skillfully in the midst of  
crises, issuing war threats and pressing Washington to make 
concessions in order to break an impasse.  One mistake American policy 
makers have made in the past has been to stress that the choice is 
between an agreement or war.  Unless unnecessarily provoked, it is 
improbable that Pyongyang would embark on a war that eventually would 
end in its defeat and demise.  The combined U.S.-ROK military 
partnership has deterred the North since the end of the Korean War.  
This deterrence will continue to function whether or not the North has 
an active nuclear weapons program.
<P>
       Additional steps that should be taken in the event of a breach 
of the nuclear freeze include:
<P>
*  A U.N. vote of condemnation.  The international community can 
pressure the North through a strong show of displeasure and concern 
over the North's actions.
<P>
*  Economic pressure on the North though a U.S.-led multilateral 
coalition.  Pressing for U.N. sanctions against North Korea would not 
be productive. A sanctions bid would be a slow, tedious process that 
may be blocked in the Security Council by the North's ally, China. 
Beijing may be more cooperative if the U.S. and its allies avoid high-
profile U.N. action. Only a small number of nations trade with the 
North. Thus, Washington and Seoul should quietly seek the cooperation 
of China, Japan, and Russia in curtailing or ceasing trade and aid to 
the North.
<P>
*  Clear U.S. reaffirmation of its defense commitments to South Korea 
and Japan.  Significant upgrading of the U.S. military presence in the 
ROK in the foreseeable future is not necessary.  The current combined 
readiness is adequate.  Any provocative movements by the North should 
be answered, however, by appropriate U.S. counteractions.
<P>
       A breach of the North's freeze would be a setback, but one that 
would show that Pyongyang never intended to fulfill its obligations 
under the agreement in the first place.  Tension on the peninsula will 
continue, but war is not the inevitable outcome.  Instead, together 
with Seoul, the U.S. should make it clear that it will deter, contain, 
and isolate the North -- as it has for more than four decades. Only an 
end to its extreme international isolation, combined with the 
institution of domestic reforms, can protect the Pyongyang regime from 
eventual collapse.  Time is on the side of Seoul and Washington, and 
Washington must not lose sight of this fact.

(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 130, "Ending the
Confusion in U.S. China Policy" April 18, 1994)<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     President Bill Clinton's decision last week to grant most-
favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China has ended, many hope,
the very difficult debate that the President has had with himself over
the future of U.S.-China relations. Clinton began his term believing
that trade sanctions could pressure China to improve human rights
conditions. But after a year of debilitating debate, he was forced to
reverse his policy of linking trade to human rights.<P>
     He was right to do so. By continuing to grant MFN to China,
Clinton will help advance the $38 billion trading relationship which
the U.S. now enjoys with the world's fastest growing economy.
Moreover, by increasing prosperity in China through greater trade, the
U.S. can help to create the economic freedoms that are the foundation
upon which political freedom will someday emerge.

<P>
THE DAMAGE DONE
<P>
     The main task for President Clinton now is to undo the damage
caused by his confused China policy. Clinton's human rights crusade
against China, and then its reversal, has seriously eroded U.S.
influence in Asia. The problem was summed up neatly in a memo by
Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Winston Lord, who wrote that
Clinton's Asia policy is characterized by an "emerging malaise." Lord
observed that Asians view the U.S. as adopting "tactics that
destabilize relationships which are central to the region's peace and
prosperity." The danger, Lord warned, was that, because of its
confused policies, the U.S. "could subvert our influence and our
interests."<P>
     The roots of Clinton's confusion over China date to the 1992
presidential campaign. At that time he accused then-President George
Bush of "coddling" the tyrants in Beijing, hinting that he might
withdraw MFN status for China. But as President Clinton approached the
annual congressional battle over MFN, he discovered the complexities
of the issue. He created a contradictory policy that was designed to
please human rights advocates while he was approving MFN. In an
Executive Order issued on May 28, 1993, Clinton stipulated that China
had to improve its human rights record in the areas of immigration,
the manufacture and export of prisoner-made goods, the treatment of
prisoners, protecting Tibet, and allowing foreign radio broadcasts in
order to qualify for renewal of MFN in 1994. 
<P>
     Instead of ending the debate, Clinton's decision only inflamed
it. His vaguely worded Executive Order allowed human rights advocates
in Congress to demand a larger share of Clinton's China policy, even
after the July 1993 decision to push for delinking trade and human
rights. The debate even raged inside the Administration, with
embarrassing results for U.S. prestige and credibility in Asia.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveled to Beijing in March to
warn Chinese leaders to improve their human rights record. Only two
months before, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had come to China with
a completely different message, suggesting that cooperation and
communication between the U.S. and China would improve the overall
relationship.
<P>

CLINTON COMES AROUND
<P>
     Clinton began to end this spectacle of confusion last week when
he decided to renew MFN almost without condition. Perhaps the most
important aspect of his decision is philosophical; the President has
now adopted the view that trade relations must be separated from U.S.
political goals with China. Moreover, he has endorsed the view that
increased U.S.-China trade can promote economic freedoms, which in the
long run will spur the growth of political freedoms in China. In
addition, by stating that he wants to end the annual debilitating
congressional debate over MFN, Clinton is strengthening the
President's authority over foreign policy. This step alone will help
to reassure Asian friends and adversaries that Clinton plans to get a
better grip on foreign policy. 

<P>
UNDOING THE DAMAGE
<P>
     But granting MFN status to China alone is not enough to undo the
damage caused to U.S. leadership, prestige, and credibility in Asia.
The Administration should construct a new China policy that serves the
totality of American interests. Now that Clinton has reversed his
policy, he should move quickly to exact a price of Beijing's
cooperation in two areas of critical concern to the U.S. They are: 
<P>
Ending North Korea's nuclear threat. Clinton should now press Beijing
    to cooperate fully with Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo to end North
    Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea's nuclear program is
    now the greatest threat to peace in Asia, and so far, Beijing has
    been reluctant to pressure its ally in Pyongyang. One reason for
    this reluctance has been Clinton's MFN policy. Now that this
    irritant in U.S.-Chinese relations has been removed, Beijing
    should be more cooperative on North Korea.
<P>
Better treatment for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Clinton also should press
    Beijing to allow the citizens of Hong Kong to establish democratic
    institutions that help protect Hong Kong's freedoms. Clinton
    should explain to the Chinese that failure to do so will undermine
    international confidence in Hong Kong as a business center, and
    thus will jeopardize China's economic growth. In addition, the
    President should press Beijing to drop its objections to allowing
    Taiwan to join international organization like the General
    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund,
    the World Bank, and the United Nations. Clinton should explain
    that Taiwan can make an important contribution to these
    organizations that China cannot.

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The spectacle of Clinton's confused and incoherent China policy
should never be repeated. America cannot afford to allow such policy
confusion to undermine its leadership in Asia or in other regions. 
<P>
     There is an important lesson to learn from Clinton's flip-flop on
China policy: There is no substitute for presidential leadership.
Being President entails making politically difficult choices to insure
that all of America's interests in Asia are protected. On critical
issues such as relations with China, the President must constantly
navigate among competing demands such as human rights, trade, and
potential regional conflicts. Clinton's failure to decide on a
balanced China policy last year was the principal cause of this year's
embarrassing policy reversal.
<P>
     Now that he has admitted his failure, the President can begin
restoring some of the credibility which he -- and the country -- have
lost over the past year.

 <H3><I> TEN STEPS TO ADDRESS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR THREAT </I></H3>

Exeuctive Memorandum #378<BR>
 3/31/94<BR>
(published at 2 pages)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>


     North Korea's ambition to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons
threatens not only America's ally, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and
the 37,000 American troops in that country, but also America's vital
interest in preserving peace in Asia.  The crisis escalated in mid-
March, when North Korea refused to allow international inspectors to
examine a suspected North Korean nuclear fuel reprocessing facility --
a vital component in nuclear weapons production -- and then, when in
response, South Korea and the United States decided to upgrade and
augment their military forces.  The current impasse will not likely
lead to war, but a protracted period of intense confrontation with
North Korea is possible.  During this difficult time, the United
States must now exercise the leadership to derail and ultimately end
North Korea's nuclear ambitions.  A strategy to achieve these
objectives would incorporate ten recommendations:
<P>
1) Lead the Allied Coalition.  
 <P>    The United States must be ready to lead its allies, especially
the ROK and Japan, in what may become a protracted and tense
confrontation with North Korea.  The goal should be to convince North
Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons-making facilities.  Washington
must not defer leadership to any other country or to the United
Nations.  North Korea's nuclear weapons program is a threat to vital
American interests.  A failure of American leadership may invite
conflict or cause other states in Asia to consider building their own
nuclear weapons. 
<P>
2) Stop Japanese Funding.  
  <P>   Washington should tell Tokyo that it must do its utmost to stop,
as soon as possible, the flow of cash from Japan to North Korea.  As
much as $1 billion a year flows into North Korea from Koreans living
in Japan.  This money comes mainly from gambling profits made in
popular pachinko parlors, and is North Korea's most important source
of foreign exchange to purchase fuel and other supplies.
<P>
3) Understand the Risks of Sanctions.  
 <P>    Washington should be prepared to seek broad economic sanctions
against North Korea, such as calling for the termination of all trade
with that regime.  However, the U.S. government needs to inform the
American people and its allies that economic sanctions could result in 
greater tensions with North Korea, and that the risk of war would be
increased. 
<P>
 4) Bolster Allied Military Forces.  
  <P>   The U.S. and South Korea should immediately correct any
deficiencies in their respective military forces in order to deter a
North Korean attack.  Washington should accelerate the deployment of
Patriot missiles to defend against North Korean SCUD missiles. 
America also should systematically dispatch additional attack aircraft
and ground-support helicopters to counter North Korea's large
advantage in artillery and armor.  Plans should be made to augment the
Pacific Fleet, including the deployment of one more aircraft carrier,
for a total of two on station in Northeast Asia.  Washington should
urge Seoul to reinforce its counter-artillery capability, upgrade its
minefields, and increase its ammunition stocks. 
<P>
5) Increase Intelligence Capabilities.  
<P>     Washington should review the adequacy of America's intelligence
collection to improve the quality of intelligence assessments
available to decision makers, especially those that go to President
Clinton.  North Korea is the most isolated regime on earth, and
accurate intelligence about that country, its leadership, and their
intentions is very scarce.  The President has a critical need for
timely intelligence on the prospect for a North Korean invasion of
South Korea, which would constitute the first major national security
crisis of his term.  Washington cannot rely exclusively on "national
technical means" such as satellites, which are unable to locate
underground nuclear facilities in North Korea.  In addition,
Washington should increase intelligence coordination with Tokyo and
Seoul. 
<P>
6) Seek Bipartisan Expertise.  
<P>     The Clinton Administration should tap into an underutilized
resource: the many people with extraordinary knowledge and experience
on Korea who have served in previous Administrations and in the
Congress.  These experienced Americans would be more than willing to
help, and ought to be consulted. 
<P>
7) Build U.S. Public Support.  
<P>     The Clinton Administration urgently needs to build a bipartisan
consensus and to seek broad public support for its Korea policy.  The
President and Administration spokesmen should explain candidly and in
much greater detail to the American people the threat posed by North
Korea.  In addition, they should explain the value of America's long
alliance with the Republic of Korea and contrast the progress in
democratization made by ROK President Kim Young Sam with the brutal
totalitarian regime of North Korea's Kim Il Sung.
<P>
8) Do Not Rely on China or Russia.  
  <P>   The U.S. should not rely on surrogates such as China and Russia
to carry out its policy objectives in the region.  Nevertheless,
Washington should consult with Russia and even formulate military
contingency plans.  As for China, an important maxim must be kept in
mind: Beijing does not have allies, only interests.  Today, China
prefers a divided Korean Peninsula and cannot be relied upon to take
action to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program.  Beijing is
Pyongyang's most important friend, supplying 75 percent of its oil. 
If political and economic sanctions are necessary to stop North
Korea's nuclear weapons program, the U.S. should make clear to China
that its cooperation is expected and then establish consequences for
Chinese non-compliance.  Moreover, the U.S. should not yield the
command of its military forces to the United Nations.
<P>
9) Interdict North Korean Missile Sales.  
<P>  The U.S. should be prepared to interdict North Korean missile sales
and transfers of technology.  It should also seek Russian and Chinese
cooperation in stopping its citizens from assisting North Korean
missile or nuclear weapons development programs.
<P>
10) Do Not Cut the U.S. Defense Budget.  
 <P>   Cutting the U.S. defense budget is the wrong message to send to
North Korea at this time.  The Clinton Administration should make up
any defense budget shortfalls, such as the $50 billion shortfall
identified by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin.
<P>
     North Korea's nuclear challenge poses the first real foreign
policy crisis for President Clinton.  He deserves the support of all
Americans as he tries to resolve this crisis.  Taking these steps
would help President Clinton strengthen American leadership and help
defuse North Korea's threat.  Strong, principled American leadership,
based on a clearly articulated strategy with broad bipartisan
congressional and public support is necessary because the stakes are
so high.  North Korea's misreading of American resolve might lead to
the outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula, with far reaching
consequences for South Korea's 42 million people, and for peace in
Asia.  For the long run, a failure to pressure North Korea now may
result in its acquiring nuclear weapons and eventually transferring
them to other dangerous regimes.  Hence, postponing decisive action
now may invite a larger crisis in the future.

<h2>Powers Congress Cannot Delegate</h2><br>
<b>By <a href="http://aspin.asu.edu/~pctp/hayworth/hayworth.html">J.D. Hayworth</a></b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thomas Jefferson feared the tendency for government to grow and for liberty to yield. The Founders' solution was to create a central government with explicitly limited powers delegated by the people and enumerated in a binding constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today the power of the federal government is nearly boundless. But even the critics of Big Government have overlooked an equally serious problem. Over the years, Congress has increasingly delegated its lawmaking powers to unelected and politically unaccountable bureaucrats. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A general principle of American jurisprudence, called the doctrine of "nondelegation," is that delegated powers cannot be redelegated. That is, Congress does not have the authority to give away its fundamental lawmaking powers. The Framers wisely followed John Locke's admonition that "the legislative cannot transfer the power of making law to any other hands." Thus Article I of the Constitution begins, "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress . . . ." For generations, the Supreme Court held that the transfer by Congress of any of these legislative powers to another branch or agency is unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the late 1930s, however, the Court reversed itself, and upheld laws by which Congress merely instructed agencies to make decisions that served "the public interest." Since then, Congress has ceded its basic legislative responsibility to executive agencies that craft and enforce regulations with the full force of law. The Supreme Court has not invalidated a single delegation of congressional power since 1935.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, evidence abounds that Congress has slipped its constitutional moorings. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells employers to make "reasonable accommodation" of handicapped workers unless there is an "undue hardship," but leaves it to the Department of Justice to determine what is reasonable (and required).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Act calls for workplace standards that are "reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe and healthful employment" but allows the secretary of labor to decide what that means. The Clean Water Act's mandate to protect "navigable rivers" permits the Army Corp of Engineers and the EPA to exercise control over any land that has a certain minimum water content. By law, commercial banks and investment firms can only affiliate if they are "well capitalized," a vague determination made by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. In 1994, the General Accounting Office measured the economic, social, and environmental cost of all regulations at more than $647 billion. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The dangers of delegating congressional authority to unelected bureaucrats are many. For one, it allows Congress to exercise its lawmaking authority and enjoy the plaudits from popular laws without taking responsibility for their legal consequences or their costs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the chief victim is accountability in government. Originally designed to be the most accountable branch of government, Congress has grown increasingly irresponsible. The fundamental link between voter and lawmaker has been obliterated by unelected regulators hiding behind bad laws. A handful of broadly written laws has spawned an alphabet soup of government agencies and an overwhelming regulatory burden that undermine the very idea of representative government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Several bills now before Congress seek to rein in unaccountable regulatory agencies. Unfortunately, these reforms aim only to improve regulations by imposing additional procedural requirements on the agencies. In effect, they seek to regulate the regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Instead, Congress should act to restore accountability in government by requiring itself to comply with Article I. The Congressional Responsibility Act would subject all regulation to Congressional approval. Under the bill, a regulation can be approved in one of two ways: (1) through an expedited process designed to limit debate and amendment and allow for a quick vote on uncontroversial regulations; (2) through the regular legislative process, whenever a majority of members agree to waive the expedited method. Regulations would only take effect if approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president. There would be no need to impose additional procedural requirements on agencies. The bill would not be retroactive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Sounds radical? This is an ideologically neutral and nonpartisan reform. Concerns about legislative delegation have been voiced by people as politically diverse as Judge Robert Bork and Nadine Strossen, the president of the American Civil Liberties Union.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If we are to restore constitutional government, Congress must first recover its legitimate powers and rein in the regulatory agencies of the executive branch. After all, rebuilding a limited federal government, whose elected representatives are accountable for the laws they pass, is the first step toward restoring the faith of the American people in their leaders and returning to the republic envisioned by our Founders.

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 for an internal audit to be 
performed by an outside accounting firm. It was a matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that 
the management of the House had been permeated with "abuses and management inefficiencies," in the words of House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992. Although a few 
House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting Office, it is likely that many have 
never been reviewed by an independent examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House 
Bank scandal, a full accounting was long overdue.
<p>
The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress that the Price Waterhouse audit  revealed 
demonstrate that the Houses financial and operational controls are worse than even the Houses 
harshest critics had imagined. The fourteen material weaknesses that auditors uncovered would 
be troubling if they appeared in a medium-sized business. Their presence in the 13,000-employee 
House of Representatives is a national disgrace. Most disturbing are the conclusions that the 
House was:<br>
<ul>
<b><li>Wasting millions of dollars on inefficient purchasing practices and superfluous staff;
<li>Permitting employee theft through multiple reimbursements for the same purchase;
<li>Allowing the use of official resources for campaign purposes; and 
<li>Keeping such careless records that the magnitude of losses to the public will probably never be known.
</ul>
</b>
<p>
<a name="acct"><h4>THE HOUSES SUBSTANDARD ACCOUNTING METHODS</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Price Waterhouse audit reveals that the House Office of Finance did not use 
generally accepted accounting principles when recording financial transactions. Instead, it kept 
track of House operations almost exclusively on a cash basis, tracking inflows and outflows of 
money. Revenue and obligations went unrecorded. Such a system is roughly similar to keeping 
track of everything an individual owns solely by reference to his checkbook. Indeed, consumers 
who had computerized their checkbooks were more sophisticated than the House, since its Office 
of Finance kept track of $700 million in annual salaries and other expenditures on hand-written 
ledgers.
<p>
Since the Office of Finance failed to keep track of such items as accounts receivable, 
accounts payable, inventory, furniture and equipment, and budgetary authority, House managers 
lacked information to make decisions about purchasing, leasing, repairing, or warehousing of 
House property.  Furthermore, since the Office did not keep track of debts incurred by the House 
(as when, for example, individual offices received items they had ordered), there was little 
assurance that sufficient funds would be available to pay these debts.  For instance, at the end of 
the third quarter of 1994 the House had over $39 million of outstanding but unrecorded 
obligations.  The dearth of information on House financial liabilities hamstrung the Offices 
ability to plan for future expenditures.
<p>
Generally accepted accounting principles dictate that financial statements offer the reader 
a high degree of credibility, are dependable, and fairly reflect the institution's financial position, 
routine operations expenses, and expected cash flows. The House accounting system and 
financial statements lacked these basic elements. Any flaw in a financial system that could 
jeopardize the safeguarding of its assets or materially misstates finances is considered a "material weakness" and a humiliating indictment of the designers of the system. The House audit 
uncovered  fourteen material weaknesses, the hazards of which are discussed below. 
<p>
<a name="controls"><h4>LOOSE CONTROLS CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEFT</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Numerous Members and staff were paid twice for travel costs.  Auditors found over 2,200 
pairs of disbursements where the House Office of Finance may have paid twice for the same 
travel voucher. A more extensive examination of the 50 largest payments found 43 cases (86 
percent of the sample) in which the House reimbursed a Member or staffer twice -- with those 
duplicate payments totaling nearly $10,000.  There is no evidence that any overpayment in these 
43 cases was ever refunded to the House.  All 43 of the double reimbursements were triggered by 
applications that violate Congressional Handbook rules about timely application or inclusion of 
travel receipts. All 43 were processed anyway.
<p>
Another opportunity for diversion of funds lay in the Houses computerized 
reimbursement system. Numerous computer clerks in the House Office of Finance who enter the 
data file used to produce reimbursement checks had the opportunity to divert funds to themselves 
or to a confederate simply by substituting a different name and address.  The only safeguard 
against this possible problem was the payments listing sent to the relevant Member or committee 
office for review each quarter.  However, the volume of payments issued by the House made this 
control ineffective.
<p>
Security in House Computer Systems was weak or nonexistent.  Access was not frozen 
when invalid passwords were used.  Users were not logged out after a period of inactivity.  The 
system did not record attempts at unauthorized access.  No procedures were in place to end 
access by ex-employees, leaving the House exposed to the risk of  ex-employees changing or 
eliminating proprietary data.
<p>
Finally, House charge cards were used to purchase some items that fall outside their 
purchase authority. Although these cards are not supposed to be used for non-travel expenses, 
auditors found nearly 350 charges for "retail" items totaling more than $31,000. Although it 
appears that the public may have been reimbursed for the purchase of personal items, Members 
and staff should not be using a government charge card to purchase personal items. 
<p>
<a name="money"><h4>MEMBERS SPENT MONEY THEY DIDNT HAVE</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
At the end of fiscal 1994, Members had overspent the sum of their appropriated expense 
allowance by over $14 million.  This was a result of the House practice that set appropriations for 
Members expense accounts significantly below the sum of those 435 allowances, since it was 
assumed that some Members would not spend up to their limit.
<p>
In FY 1994, however, total spending on Members office accounts exceeded their appropriations. This $14 million shortfall was covered by reprogramming roughly $11.6 million 
from other FY 1994 House appropriations and $2.6 million from unused appropriations left over 
from prior years (FY 1991 and 1992).
<p>
The necessity of reprogramming funds demonstrates that the House Office of Finance's 
inadequate monitoring failed to prevent Member allowance overspending.  The Office failed to 
extrapolate spending trends over the course of the fiscal year, focusing only on spending that 
already had taken place.  
<p>
Five Members overspent their official allowances in 1994.  Since the Handbook specifies 
that any overspending Member is personally liable for the overage, the auditors referred the 
names of the five Members to the House Office of Finance for followup.
<p>
This problem of Member overspending is only one illustration of a general problem: 
House managers routinely failed to check whether they had funds available before ordering 
goods and services or writing payroll checks, creating the risk of spending funds the House did 
not have.  Although the managers of the Houses financial system had the capability of checking 
to see whether there was money available to spend on goods and services, they did not do so.  
House managers therefore never knew how much already had been committed, or whether there 
was any danger that the House might lack funds to cover expenditures.  Because of the routine 
near-the-limit use of Members allowances, and their collective under-funding, there was a 
particular danger of overspending those accounts.
<p>
<a name="inad"><h4>INADEQUATE CONTROLS LED TO FRANKING ABUSES</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The audit revealed that Members may have broken House franking rules. The use of the 
frank (taxpayer-funded congressional mail) is regulated by Congress to lessen the possibility of 
Members' use of official resources to strengthen their reelection prospects. Two types of mass 
mailing regulations -- Franking Commission approval (to ensure that the mailing is not 
inappropriately self-publicizing) and deadline rules (to ensure that the mailing does not appear in 
voters mailboxes too soon before elections) -- appear to have been violated. In the course of 
sampling several hundred mailings, auditors found three instances where the House paid for 
printing of mass mailings without Franking Commission approval, and six instances where mass 
mailings apparently were sent after preelection deadlines. These are serious improprieties, since 
they suggest end runs around rules designed to ensure a minimum standard of fairness in federal 
elections.
<p>
<a name="ineff"><h4>INEFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION AND CARELESS RECORD-KEEPING: A RECIPE FOR WASTE AND CONFUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The auditors highlighted numerous areas of waste by House administrators: for example, 
deciding not to use temporary or part-time workers during peak workload periods, choosing 
instead to keep high staff levels throughout the year. Hundreds of full-time support employees 
were paid essentially to sit idle during the 241 days the House was not in session in 1994. House 
Members' paychecks were processed at a cost of roughly $46 apiece, although private companies 
could have done the job at less than 2 percent of the cost. House administrators also spent over 
$5 million on a computer that did not meet House needs. 
<p>
Auditors also detected numerous flaws in the Houses system of internal records. A 
lackadaisical attitude towards record-keeping requirements can lead to numerous problems: in 
addition to waste, opportunity for fraud, and administrative incoherence, poor record-keeping 
also breeds a careless attitude about getting the job done right. House records were extremely 
deficient in many areas. 
<p>
The Houses payroll policy permitted payroll adjustments to be filed by Members even 
after payday deadlines. Late payroll adjustments produced 3,400 supplemental paychecks during 
the audit period, resulting in $299,000 in overpayments to employees. Although most of those 
overpayments were repaid, nearly $13,000 in 1994 overpayments remains uncollected. This 
unwieldy system of pay distribution caused the House routinely to run a supplemental payroll 
every payday and incur large system and labor costs to produce and reconcile extra checks 
manually.
<p>
The incomplete records of the catering service run by House Restaurant Systems (HRS) 
provided remarkable opportunities to cheat the public. When HRS was privatized in July of 
1994, it sent numerous letters to Members and non-Members notifying them that they still had 
outstanding bills. Many putative debtors replied by stating that they had already paid their bills, 
and HRS accepted all these replies at face value. Its debt-tracking system was in "disarray," according to auditors, and HRS multiplied this disarray by failing to keep copies of the debt 
collection letters, any responses to them, its pre-July 1994 receivable balance, or a cash ledger 
which matched inflows of money to creditors. The only records that HRS was able to show 
investigators were check stubs and deposit slips for catering services that had been intermingled 
with "records" for other HRS functions. 
<p>
The Office of Finance failed to keep accurate records of property that the House owned 
and leased. Not only did a records vacuum make it difficult for House managers to discover 
efficiencies in buying, leasing, and maintaining equipment, but it increased the risk of 
undiscovered loss or theft of House property. Responsibility for property records was dispersed 
over ten different offices, and none of the three offices responsible for recording the bulk of 
House property kept ledgers that met the requirements followed by executive branch agencies. 
Combined with the absence of any system in the House Finance Office to track lease or sale 
costs, these accounting weaknesses increased the possibility of the House entering into contracts 
with unfavorable terms. For instance, the $9,000 that the Office of Finance paid to lease an 
outdated laser printer could have been used to lease or buy several newer printers. Auditors 
estimate that the House spent at least $750,000 on leases and related services for outdated 
equipment or equipment that could have been purchased more cheaply.
<p>
The House frequently was late in paying its bills. Of the $279 million paid during the 15-
month audit period, over 25 percent of the payments were for goods and services received over 
four months before the payment date, and over 15 percent of the payments were over a year old. 
Additional tests of payments made during the 104th Congress revealed that over $1.5 million 
covered services received in 1991, and some payments were made for services dating as far back 
as 1986.
<p>
In many cases, no House office retained the required Certificates of Relationship/Non-
Relationship to Any Current Member of Congress that each employee must complete and file 
when hired. This form is designed to alert House administrators to the possibility of nepotism in 
hiring. Absence of these required forms cripples a system designed to raise a red flag at the 
possibility of nepotistic hiring. Furthermore, House administrators failed to retain accurate leave 
cards, which record the amount of overtime pay and accrued leave to which House employees are 
entitled. Auditors who investigated a representative sample of 181 employees found that nearly 
half of the cards were missing, and a quarter of the remainder were useless because they were 
incompletely filled out. 
<p>
<a name="members"><h4>MEMBERS GOT A FREE RIDE</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The House routinely subsidized many services Members purchase through office 
accounts. These subsidies obscured any comparison of costs between Members, made purchasers 
unaware of the true cost of goods, and forced other parts of the House to bear burdens incurred 
by Members' personal offices.
<p>
For instance, the House Office of Telecommunications charged Members only a fraction 
of the price of the communications service they purchased.  Members clerk-hire allowance was 
charged for staff salaries, but not for staff benefits, thus obscuring the payroll  amount available 
for each Member by roughly 30 percent.  Members were not charged for the funds the House 
spent on calendars (more than $1 million alone), the use of the House Folding Room to process 
mass mailings, the cost of furnishing Capitol offices, or the expense of numerous House 
computer services.  Such costs ultimately were paid for with funds appropriated for non-Member 
accounts.
<p>
Members also were allowed to spread out the cost of systems purchased so as to obscure 
their expense and, in some cases, escape part of their cost.  For instance, Members were given the 
option of spreading the cost of capital purchases over three years.  If a Member purchasing the 
equipment retired or failed to be reelected to office, those costs would be written off and 
subsidized by another House account, thus allowing Members to escape a substantial portion of 
the debt.
<p>
This system of hidden subsidies failed to hold purchasers accountable for the expenses 
they incur and gave them little incentive to manage expenses efficiently.
<p>
<b><a name="congress">IS CONGRESS ABOVE THE LAW?</h4></a></b>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Many of the Houses financial problems would likely have been curbed had Congress 
been subject to the same laws and regulations that apply to the executive branch and other federal 
agencies. Numerous laws that apply to the executive branch, such as the Chief Financial Officers 
Act of 1990 and the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982, do not apply to the 
House. The Antideficiency Act, which forbids any federal office from incurring obligations and 
spending monies that total more than its yearly appropriation during that fiscal year, almost 
certainly does not apply to the House. The House did not follow guidelines for federal agencies 
provided by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program. Only the rules the House 
makes for itself and the procedures in the Congressional Handbook control House procedure, 
and those are easily skirted. 
<p>
Indeed, the House granted exceptions to its own rules so frequently as to make those 
rules, in some cases, operationally non-binding. For instance, the House had produced an 
Approved List of office equipment and software, which was intended to ensure reasonable prices, 
eliminate the necessity for multiple quotes, and avoid a lengthy bid solicitation process. Over 30 
percent of the $18 million that the House spent on equipment and software in the 103rd 
Congress, however, was on unapproved material for which Members had requested exemptions. 
The Committee on House Administration routinely granted exemptions, denying only 3 percent 
of the 1,026 exemption requests. 
<p>
A liberal exemption policy created numerous opportunities for waste and corruption:
<ul>
<li>Routine approval of reimbursement for travel vouchers that were submitted late or incomplete created the possibility for double payment to careless or dishonest filers.
<li>Numerous House offices required three price quotes when making purchases, but auditors found that 72 percent of the purchases of the House Office of Special Services and 100 percent of the purchases of House information Services were made without benefit of these multiple quotes. The majority of these purchases were made without benefit of any competitive 
bidding whatsoever. 
<li>Nearly 400 retroactive pay raises were approved for Members staffs -- a practice prohibited by the Congressional Handbook, presumably because it permits large lump sums of public money to be deposited in staffers accounts as bonuses.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="silver"><h4>THE SILVER LINING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-GA), House Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA), Representative Jim Nussle 
(R-IA), its administrative officers, and the management team they brought in, has taken 
aggressive action to correct the deficiencies identified by the audit. Many of the 226 
recommendations the auditors made already have been implemented, and the remainder are being 
implemented. The Democratic leadership has pledged to work for full implementation of the 
audits recommendations and to continue the practice of annual open audits of the House.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The numerous opportunities for waste, fraud, and corruption that Price Waterhouse found 
in the Houses financial system constitute an indictment of House officers, members of the 
House Administration Committee, and the House leadership that permitted this financial disaster 
to happen. This system is so punctured by missing records and other gaps that its accounts are 
fundamentally not auditable. The audit paints a portrait of business conducted through rules that 
were routinely overridden by the House leadership, which contributed to partisan abuse 
reminiscent of a Soviet-style bureaucracy. Although the stories it tells are eye-opening, its 
greatest importance lies in the recommendations for actions it implies. The House has taken 
quick action to eliminate the auditing defects that Price Waterhouse detected, and investigate the 
administrative abuses that the auditors noted they lacked the resources to pursue fully, by 
referring auditors questions directly to the Inspector General for a forensic audit. These 
questions include whether:
<ul>
<b><li>Exceptions to House Rules were granted in a partisan fashion;
<li>The House Restaurant System was defrauded;
<li>Retroactive pay hikes were granted inappropriately; and
<li>Franking and mass mailing rules were broken.
</ul>
</b>
In sum, the audits reveal a House of Representatives so penetrated by sloppy management 
practices that the public will likely never know exactly how many millions of dollars it wasted. 
The House audit scandal is an unhappy but predictable consequence of a hidebound institution 
hidden from public scrutiny, protected from the laws that govern its public and private 
counterparts, and thought by too many for too long to be invulnerable to shifts in control 
determined by the electoral process.

<TITLE>Pay Freeze and Staff Cuts Needed To Perfect Reformist Legislative Appropriation Bill -- Heritage </TITLE>

<h3>PAY FREEZE AND STAFF CUTS NEEDED TO PERFECT REFORMIST LEGISLATIVE
APPROPRIATION BILL</h3>

By Dan Greenberg<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #418<br>
June 19, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
<P>
 This week, the House of Representatives will consider the Legislative
Branch Appropriations Bill for FY 1996. The bill will provide
systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted,
including spending cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary
offices and functions. The only significant reforms the bill fails
to address are a pay freeze for Members of Congress and a reduction
in Members' staff and office expenses. Amendments on these topics
may be offered on the House floor.
<P>
<B> Spending Cuts.</B> The House bill proposes to reduce legislative
branch spending by nearly $155 million next year, or about 8 percent.
When the Senate, which is responsible for its own budget, adds
its anticipated cuts, savings should exceed $200 million. If proportional
cuts were made in all government spending, the deficit would be
reduced by approximately $143 billion. These cuts are achieved
through major restructuring and economies in congressional operations.
If the Clinton Administration's &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;
efforts had resulted in similarly proportioned reductions, 80
percent of the $176 billion FY1995 federal deficit would be eliminated.
<P>
 Among the major spending reductions in the bill are:
<UL>
<LI>A 25 percent cut in the General Accounting Office's appropriation
over two years. 
<LI>Elimination of 2,350 jobs from congressional payrolls, an
8.6 percent reduction. 
<LI>Removal of funding for constituent copies of the <I>Congressional
Record</I>.
<LI>Cancellation of subscriptions to the entire United States
Code for every lawmaker. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
  The bill will require congressional agencies to absorb pay increases
at their current level of funding, and all agencies (except the
Library of Congress) will be held to the previous year's level
of funding or below.
<P>
<B> Privatization.</B> Working with the House Oversight Committee,
the Appropriations Committee determined that a number of operations
currently performed by congressional agencies could be accomplished
more efficiently by the private sector. The bill privatizes several
functions immediately and requires studies in other areas.
<P>
 The General Accounting Office is pushed to privatize its administrative
functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services.
It also will be provided with funds to contract out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available
in the private sector. 
<P>
 The bill will abolish the &quot;revolving funds&quot; that support
House barber shops, beauty shops, and recording studios, leaving
those services to be performed on a break-even basis. Direct funding
for an office devoted solely to flying flags over the Capitol
(which are then sent to constituents) is also eliminated. Responsibility
for this operation, estimated to cost over $325,000 per year,
will be turned over to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.
<P>
 Preparing for additional privatization efforts, the bill instructs
the Office of the Architect to issue requests for proposals for
private-sector bids for U.S. Capitol custodial services. The Architect
is also ordered to study privatization of the Capitol's $11 million
power plant.
<P>
<B> Elimination.</B> The bill eliminates the $21 million Office
of Technology Assessment, an agency many criticize as redundant.
The House Special Services Office, which serves as a kind of concierge
for Members, House Administrators, and favored guests, is also
eliminated by the appropriations measure. Funding for the Joint
Committee on Printing is cut sharply with eventual abolition in
view. Similarly, the bill funds the Joint Economic Committee in
FY1996 (cutting its funding, however, by $1.2 million), but the
committee report suggests there will be no funding in 1997.
<P>
 In a minor disappointment the bill fails to eliminate the century-old
Government Printing Office, but does impose several economies
on printing operations. Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) has estimated
that it is three times as expensive for GPO to print any document
than it is for a private sector firm. The highly competitive private
printing industry is a strong argument against retaining the GPO
and its yearly budget of $121 million.
<P>
 In moves to streamline operations and reduce Congress's administrative
duties, the appropriations bill would remove non-legislative activities
from direct congressional supervision. With the cooperation of
the House Oversight Committee, it will place the House post office
under Postal Service supervision and, as of next year, transfer
control of the Botanical Garden to the National Arboretum.
<P>
 Especially in view of simultaneous reforms by the House Oversight
Committee, the bill is a tremendous improvement over the legislative
appropriations of previous Congresses. However, some areas for
potential improvement remain:
<P>
<B> Members' Salaries.</B> Because Members' salaries (currently
$133,600 per year) are funded by a permanent, indefinite appropriation
rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they are nearly
invulnerable to legislative change when the rest of Congress's
budget is under discussion. Congress should work to make Members'
salaries a legislative appropriations line item and eliminate
the automatic salary COLA that, unless Congress acts, gives each
Member an automatic pay hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates
the spirit of the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which states
that Members must stand for reelection before any pay raise they
vote on takes effect. <B>At the very least, this year's legislative
appropriations bill should eliminate the pay hike that otherwise
would automatically go into effect.</B>
<P>
<B> Members' Accounts.</B> This year's appropriation combines
the three Members' personal allowance accounts (staff salaries,
office expenses, and official mail) into one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease administrative
burdens. However, the combined account is increased by over 2
percent to over $360 million due to increases in staff salaries
and mail funding. Although increases in postal rates and population
may justify some adjustment of mail allowances, it is difficult
to make similar arguments for an increase in the aggregate staff
salary appropriation. During the debate at the beginning of this
year over the elimination of Legislative Service Organizations,
advocates of LSO abolition intimated that a substantial portion
of their $5 million yearly expense would be saved. In fact, even
steeper staff cuts are justified. <B>A 10 percent ($25 million)
cut in the staff salary portion of the new combined account would
deliver the savings promised from LSO elimination and extend the
staff reductions achieved in almost every other congressional
operation to Member's personal offices for the first time.</B>
<P>
 In an era of downsizing and restructuring, the House's willingness
to examine Congress itself for savings is a welcome response to
citizens' demands for economy in government. Although amendments
to freeze Members' pay and cut personal staff funding are still
needed, the Legislative Branch Appropriation for Fiscal Year 1996
represents a radical and welcome departure from politics as usual.

CONGRESSIONAL PAY, PENSIONS, PERKS, AND STAFF </I></H3>

INTRODUCTION 
 <P>
Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on Congress 
and helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution.  The new Republican 
majorities in the House and Senate moved quickly to cut staff and 
expenses and eliminate many of Congress's exemptions from the law.  
Further steps are necessary, however, to reduce perks, reform 
pensions, and further trim staff.  Congressional committees currently 
are considering some of these reforms, while others will likely be 
debated in the course of the appropriations process.  But several 
problems remain.  
 <P>
Automatic pay raises are scheduled each year with no vote required, 
further boosting lawmakers' salaries, which already exceed $11,000 a 
month; 
 <P>
Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans, and 
benefits exceed those of most other federal employees; 
 <P>
Taxpayer-funded mailings, travel, and other perks are abused to 
promote incumbents' reelection bids; and 
 <P>
Congress remains the most heavily staffed legislature in the world. 
 <P>
These perks continue to insulate Congress from American citizens, 
frustrate political fairness, and promote legislative careerism and 
bureaucracy.  Reforms in these areas will mean a more efficient, 
representative, and politically competitive Congress. 
  <P>   
PAY.  Congress should repeal its automatic pay raise so that Members 
will have to bear political responsibility for raising their own pay.  
Given the recent adoption of the 27th Amendment -- which attempts to 
prevent lawmakers from raising their own pay without taking 
responsibility for it at the polls -- the time for ending automatic 
pay hikes has come.  Because that amendment was drafted long before 
cost of living adjustments were conceived, the constitutionality of 
current automatic adjustments is debatable, but the amendment's intent 
is clear and gives Congress an additional reason to end the practice.  
Congress also should enforce existing federal laws that dock 
lawmakers' pay for unexcused absences. 
 <P>
PENSIONS.  Congress should reform its pension system, which encourages 
careerism and is twice as generous as any private-sector plan.  The 
current system of escalating benefits creates open-ended liabilities 
for taxpayers and should be changed to one funded largely or 
exclusively by the contributions of Members themselves, similar to 
private-sector 401(k) retirement accounts.  New rules should apply to 
all Members elected or reelected in 1996 or later, forcing Members 
either to leave office at the end of the 104th Congress under the old 
pension system or to continue into the 105th Congress under new rules. 
 <P>
PERKS.  Official franking (postage), travel, and media resources 
contribute significantly to historically high incumbent reelection 
rates.  Congress should trim perks with an eye to eliminating 
unjustifiable campaign-related spending, especially the frank.  At a 
minimum, the House should double the franking cuts recently authorized 
by its Oversight Committee.  Congress's ultimate goal should be to 
eliminate the mass mailings its Members send out -- mailings which 
accomplish little besides serving as taxpayer-funded quasi- campaign 
aids -- either by cutting the funds available for franking or 
by regulating mass mailings out of existence.  Subsidies for 
publications and services like calendars and recording studios that 
lack any legislative function should be ended, and such other perks as 
frequent flier miles accrued through official travel and free medical 
care from military hospitals should be disallowed. 
 <P>
STAFF.  Congress's huge staff is expensive and opens the door to 
bigger and more intrusive government.  The role played by aides in 
congressional elections should be curtailed or eliminated entirely.  A 
cut in personal staffs, so far untouched by the new Republican 
Congress, would force lawmakers to make more decisions directly 
instead of 
leaving them to subordinates. 
  <P>    
The new Congress has made an impressive start on franking and 
committee staff cuts.  However, to complete the reform effort, Members 
must deal with their automatic pay raises, fat pensions, taxpayer-
funded perks, and retinues of personal staff.  Until they do, the 
overgrown Congress will remain less efficient, effective, and thrifty 
and more insulated from the real world than it ought to be. 
 <P>
 
A FAST START FOR REFORMS 
 <P>
Congressional reform was a major focus of the Contract with America, 
and the new Congress deserves praise for aggressively beginning to 
reform itself in a few short weeks.  Rules changes and staff cuts were 
among the first- day items in the Contract, which also included term 
limits, line-item veto power for the President, and a balanced budget 
amendment.  Such changes will affect congressional powers and 
operations dramatically. 
 <P>
On the very first day the House was in session, it voted to shrink 
committee staff by one-third and abolish three committees and twenty-
five subcommittees, in keeping with the promises of the Contract.  
Given that House committee staff had grown to roughly 1,200 percent of 
its size at the end of World War II, such a cut was long overdue.  
These reforms did more than eliminate some committee redundancy; they 
saved money.  The Oversight Committee was able to cut committee 
funding by 30 percent because of staff cuts, saving taxpayers $67 
million yearly.  Similar cuts -- a 15 percent cut in committee funding 
and a 12.5 percent cut in funds for leadership offices -- have been 
made in the Senate. 
 <P>
In January, Congress passed and the President signed legislation 
applying to Congress eleven federal laws, such as the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 
Civil Rights Act, from which it had been exempt.  for the first time 
in history, aggrieved staffers can take their cases to federal court, 
argue them before a jury, and have access to appeals.  The rapid 
passage of the Congressional Accountability Act with strong bipartisan 
support is a credit to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole, and other congressional leaders. 
 <P>
In March, the House Oversight Committee approved a one-third cut in 
members' franking allowances from their 1994 authorizations.  This 
would save over $20 million in postage-related spending yearly, 
bringing down the average yearly spending ceiling per congressional 
office from $163,000 to $108,000.  This is a healthy step on the road 
to elimination of franking abuses. 
 <P>
In April, the House passed legislation that would bring generous 
congressional pensions more in line with those of other federal 
employees.  The legislation would reduce the benefits accrual rate to 
equal those of other federal employees; increase the contributions 
lawmakers and other federal employees make to their own retirement, 
bringing the share of benefits paid for by employees from 28 percent 
to 34 percent; and bring pension calculation practices into parity 
with the private sector by calculating 
retirement ann cities on the basis of the highest five, not three, 
years of salaried employment.  These reforms are long overdue, given 
that the federal employee pension system now has a shortfall of over 
half a trillion dollars, which must be paid for out of general 
revenues. 
 <P>
In short, the actions Congress already has taken demonstrate a serious 
commitment to internal reform and bode well for the difficult tasks 
that lie ahead.  The most pressing areas for further reform are 
congressional pay, pensions, perks, and staff. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PAY 
 <P>
Federal lawmakers' salaries have been a source of controversy since 
the early nineteenth century.  When Congress passed its first pay 
raise in 1816, furious voters replaced nearly two-thirds of the House 
of Representatives  -- a turnover rate unsurpassed until the 
controversies over slavery that led eventually to the War Between the 
States.  The next Congress responded by repealing the pay raise.  
Perennial controversies over lawmakers' pay have led Congress to 
experiment with establishing independent panels to set pay scales, 
providing tax deductions for lawmakers' Washington living expenses, 
and attaching congressional pay raises to bills adjusting all federal 
workers' salaries. 
 <P>          Currently, the taxpayer pays each Member of Congress 
$133,600 yearly.  The "ethics reform" passed by Congress in 1989 
provided for annual cost of living adjustments (COLAs) derived from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics' index of wages and salaries in private 
industry so that lawmakers would never have to vote on politically 
explosive pay raises.  Representative John Boehner (R-OH), now 
Chairman of the House Republican Conference, brought suit against the 
automatic COLA in 1992 on the grounds that it violates the 27th 
Amendment's stricture against implementing legislative pay raises 
without an intervening election.  The lawsuit failed at both the 
federal district and federal appellate levels, however, thus making 
the amendment's intent -- that a Congress should not be allowed to 
change its own salary without an intervening election -- a 
dead letter.  Neither Boehner nor the other 20 Members who had 
standing in the case chose to appeal the appellate decision to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P> 
          Although  the congressional COLAs are intended to be 
automatic, it is possible for determined Members to block their 
implementation.  Last year, for instance, the House voted to amend the 
Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bill to delete the pay raise 
scheduled for January 1995.  When Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot 
(R-IA) realized that the conference committee for the appropriation 
intended to delete the House provision blocking the pay hike, he 
threatened to call for a House vote to instruct the conference 
committee to eliminate the pay raise.  Although Lightfoot's motion 
would not have been binding on the conferees, the threat of having to 
defy what almost certainly would have been a lopsided negative vote 
was enough to make the committee retreat on its pay raise efforts.  
Similar efforts blocked a COLA scheduled for 1994. 
 <P>
          Ultimately, however, such actions block COLAs for only one 
year, leaving automatic pay raises to reappear every year.  The long-
term solution is to rewrite the law to eliminate automatic pay raises, 
especially since the political pressures that blocked new COLAs for 
the past two years show every sign of continuing.  Since most workers 
do not receive an automatic pay hike every year, it is difficult to 
see why Congress should, especially when Members do not even have to 
vote on it.  The Constitution puts Congress in charge of setting its 
own pay; Members should accept that responsibility. 
 <P>
          Representatives Michael Bilirakis (R-FL), Howard Coble (R-
NC), Marge Roukema  (R-NJ), and Gerald Solomon (R-NY) independently 
have introduced legislation that would eliminate the automatic 
congressional COLA currently in effect.  Representative Andy Jacobs's 
(D-IN) H.R.  834 would cut congressional pay to its 1989, pre-"ethics 
reform" level of $89,500 yearly. 
<P> 
          The federal law that requires Members to forgo their salary 
if they fail to show up for work should be enforced.  This has become 
a problem particularly among lawmakers who run for other offices or 
lose their primary bids for reelection.  For instance, in the 103rd 
Congress, Representative Craig Washington (D-TX), who was beaten in 
his reelection primary, subsequently failed to show up for work for 
two months; Representative Jim Slattery (D-KS) was absent for 40 days 
while campaigning unsuccessfully for governor; and Representative Fred 
Grandy (R-IA) was absent for more than a month during his failed 
gubernatorial campaign.  Over $47,000 of taxpayer money was paid to 
these three no- show Congressmen for the days they missed.  Since 
federal law permits paid absences for lawmakers only in the case of 
personal or family illness, these Representatives essentially are 
profiting from Congress's failure to enforce its own laws -- a problem 
that is compounded when unexcused absences occur just before primary 
elections, since voters have relatively little opportunity to take 
absences into account.  The National Taxpayers Union has filed a 
complaint with the House Ethics Committee, but ethics complaints 
should not be required to make Congress follow the rules it has set 
for itself. 
<P> 
          Paying lawmakers' salaries when they do not show up for work 
not only wastes money, but also subsidizes their campaigns for 
election to other offices or reelection to those they already hold.  
Former congressional candidate Michael Maibach has experienced how 
campaign laws make it more difficult for private-sector employees to 
be elected to Congress:  "[Out of 15 candidates for one congressional 
seat, I was] the only one on a private payroll.  The other 14 included 
three sitting county supervisors and one state legislator.  While the 
law required that I not campaign on [my employer's] time, those 
already in office had no such constraint.  Taxpayers, in effect, paid 
them to campaign for their next office!...  Lawmakers who make it 
illegal to campaign on 'company time' make it legal for themselves to 
campaign on 'government time.'"  Maibach 
concludes that the current system locks out most candidates who are 
not self-employed, independently wealthy, or already holding public 
office. 
<P> 
          In addition to the tremendous disadvantages private-sector 
candidates already face, the Federal Election Commission has proposed 
greater regulation of the personal use of campaign funds, which would 
eliminate candidates' ability to pay themselves a salary during 
campaigns.  Payment of salaries from campaign funds is often the only 
way many 
challengers can approach parity with incumbents, each of whom is paid 
a full salary even while campaigning.  Ironically, when former 
Maryland Senate candidate Alan Keyes paid himself a salary from 
campaign funds, he was buffeted by accusations of unethical conduct, 
despite the fact that his purpose was merely to put himself on the 
same level as the incumbent he faced -- who retained a full-time 
salary while campaigning, paid for by 
taxpayers. 
 <P>
          The most sweeping solution to the problem of a Congress too 
highly paid and too insulated from the experiences of the rest of the 
country is presidential aspirant Lamar Alexander's proposal to "cut 
their pay and send them home."  Alexander advocates a 50 percent 
salary cut coupled with legislative sessions of no more than six 
months per year.  This would permit lawmakers to retain an authentic 
connection to the districts they represent by living and working 
there, rather than acquiring a Washington mindset that often is 
antithetical to the desires of their constituents.  
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS 
 <P>
     Congress's pension system is roughly twice as generous as those 
of most Fortune 500 corporations.  Not only do these generous pensions 
burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by 
providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure.  Over 250 
Members of the 103rd Congress will become "pension millionaires," 
receiving pension income after their retirement in excess of $1 
million.  For instance, former Speaker of the House Tom Foley is 
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in addition to the pay he will 
receive from his job at a lobbying/law firm.  The former Speaker could 
take in over $3 million in pension checks over the course of his 
expected lifetime.  COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as 
well as congressional salaries.  Only one in ten private-sector 
pensions is adjusted for inflation, and many of those compensate for 
only 
a third of the inflation rate. 
 <P>
          Although some Members of Congress have defended their 
pension system as being the same as that of other federal workers, 
legislators' pensions actually are far more generous.  Congressional 
pension formulas have the same high "accrual rate" -- one of the 
formula's three variables -- as those of policemen and firefighters.  
Since the pension 
formulas of few other occupations are so high, and since the work of a 
Congressman rarely contains dangers on a par with entering burning 
buildings or subduing felons, it is difficult to justify the extra-
high accrual rates.  Inflated pension formulas compound the problem of 
legislators' ignorance of and inexperience with the economic 
challenges of those they ostensibly represent. 
 <P>
          With the public becoming noticeably more exercised about 
congressional pensions, several lawmakers have produced pension reform 
proposals.  Representative Howard Coble's (R-NC) H.R.  165 is the most 
radical; it removes legislators from the federal employee retirement 
system, thus eliminating pension benefits from congressional service.  
Another Coble bill, H.R.  126, would eliminate the COLA from 
congressional pensions.  Senator John McCain's (R-AZ) S.  48 would 
subject legislators' retirement 
annuities to the standard current earnings test, which would make 
congressional pension recipients vulnerable to the same rate of 
taxation that Social Security recipients face.  Senator Spencer 
Abraham's (R-MI) S.  355 would mandate disclosure of pension 
contributions, expected returns, and any other information needed to 
calculate the total costs to taxpayers of congressional pensions.  
Senator Richard Bryan (D-NV) has offered S.  288, which lowers 
congressional pension accrual rates to the same level as federal 
pensions and caps retired lawmakers' payments at the level of their 
final high salary; in the House, Representatives Glen Browder (D-AL) 
and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) have introduced similar measures, H.R.  907 
and H.R.  575, respectively.  As noted above, pension reforms recently 
approved by the House include adjustments to accrual rates.  Senator 
Bryan has promised to seek a vote on his measure shortly. 
 <P>
          Representative Dan Miller's (R-FL) proposal, H.R.  804, is 
the most comprehensive:  Miller's plan would eliminate the current 
congressional pension system for Members who begin their service in 
the 105th Congress or later and replace it with a 401(k)-style tax-
exempt savings plan.  This would mirror the move from "defined 
benefit" plans to "defined contribution" plans currently taking place 
in the private sector by letting legislators decide how much they wish 
to contribute to their own retirement and freeing taxpayers from 
unfunded pension liabilities.  Contributions of up to 5 percent of 
salary would be matched for up to twelve years of service, after 
which, although the limit for a Member's own contributions would be 
raised to 10 percent, taxpayers no longer would match these retirement 
savings.  Capping the donation limit at twelve years would remove any 
pension-related financial incentive for serving in Congress longer 
than that period of time.  Legislators also would retain Social 
Security benefits.  Members with service prior to the 105th Congress 
would be allowed to continue contributing to their pensions until they 
were vested, in order to fulfill the expectations upon which they 
relied when making previous contributions, but no more contributions 
after the twelve- year limit would be accepted. 
 <P>
          Miller's plan moves in the right direction, but it could be 
improved.  The ultimate goal of pension reform should be to remove all 
lawmakers from defined benefit plans.  This would reduce the 
incentives to stay in office and would be a first step toward easing 
the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement System 
(currently estimated at over $500 billion).  The best solution is to 
require all Members to enter defined contribution plans as a condition 
of further congressional service.  Since it is arguably unfair to take 
away benefits without notice from lawmakers who have planned for them 
in the past, lawmakers ought to be given a choice: either retire at 
the end of the 104th Congress with their current pension intact or 
(assuming they win reelection) enter the 105th Congress with a defined 
contribution plan that does not impose additional liabilities on the 
taxpayer. 
 <P>
          A similar proposal was applied in the 102nd Congress, when 
Members were given notice that they would forfeit the privilege of 
taking their campaign funds for personal use upon retirement, as they 
traditionally had been able to do, if they remained into the 103rd 
Congress.  Although some defenders of the current pension system may 
argue that lawmakers who assumed it would continue have made their 
financial plans on that basis, election to Congress is a limited-term 
contract of employment that inevitably expires.  Since lawmakers are 
not entitled to assume they will win their next campaign for 
reelection, they certainly cannot assume continuous preservation and 
expansion of pension benefits premised upon reelection.  
 <P>
Finally, Congress should adopt a similar solution for all federal 
employees, since switching congressional pensions to a defined 
contribution system leaves the problem of other federal pensions -- 
and their unfunded liabilities -- unsolved.  The legislation the House 
passed in April, which equalizes accrual rates and contribution levels 
among Members, congressional staff, and other federal workers, is a 
step toward this goal.  However, it only postpones rather than 
eliminates the liability crisis which ultimately will be borne by 
taxpayers. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PERKS 
 <P>
     The keystone of congressional perks is the frank -- mail from 
congressional offices paid for by taxpayers, not lawmakers.  Use of 
the frank permits every incumbent to send out hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of self-publicizing mail and stoke the fires of 
reelection.  Although House measures to cut staff, committees, and 
subcommittees have received more attention, franking cuts arguably are 
even more important.  Earlier this month, the House Oversight 
Committee authorized a one-third cut from the 1994 funding level for 
franked mail, bringing down the average spending ceiling per member 
for franked mail from $326,000 to $216,000 per two- year term.  (Even 
this reduced ceiling exceeds the amount -- roughly $206,000 -- the 
average major-party challenger spent on his entire 1994 campaign.) A 
series of reforms in Senate franking over the past several 
years have come close to eliminating taxpayer-funded mass mailings in 
that body. 
 <P>
          Although the franking privilege dates back to the First 
Continental Congress of 1775, most of the abuses it has fostered have 
a considerably more modern pedigree.  Many derive from "postal patron" 
mailings, delivered to each stop on a postal route and therefore not 
required to carry a specific name or address.  Before the early 1960s, 
postal patron mail almost always was restricted to rural or private 
carrier routes.  (For two brief periods, first in the mid-1930s and 
later in the mid-1950s, city routes could receive postal patron 
mailings.) Since that time, expanded use of postal patron mail and 
advances in technology -- primarily computers that sort and target 
demographic groups and printers that produce personalized letters -- 
have combined to grant incumbents impressive taxpayer-funded direct-
mail capabilities. 
 <P>
          Before 1973, the only standards that regulated franking were 
those formulated by the courts and postal authorities, whose 
reluctance to irritate Congress led to lax enforcement and general 
confusion about the frank's proper use.  This climate led to several 
questionable uses of the frank in the 1972 elections.  Representative 
Fletcher Thompson (R-GA), for example, sent franked mail to voters 
across his state in the course of an unsuccessful Senate campaign.  
The cost of the mailing -- over $200,000 -- became a factor in 
Thompson's eventual loss to Sam Nunn.  With twelve cases of alleged 
abuse in the courts, lawmakers moved in 1973 to create new franking 
guidelines.  New regulations defined frankable material, restricted 
mass mailings, and created a House Commission on Congressional Mailing 
Standards to resolve franking disputes and rule on individual cases.  
Similar duties were assigned to the Senate Select Committee on 
Standards and Conduct (later renamed the Select Ethics Committee). 
 <P>
          Although the regulations  issued by the Commission on 
Mailing Standards have eliminated the frank's most crassly reelection- 
oriented uses (for instance, Members are blocked from sending mass 
mailings statewide or 60 days before they appear on the ballot, must 
disclose the amount they spend on franking, and no longer may send 
letters of congratulation for birthdays or anniversaries), they betray 
an awareness that mass mailings are used all too frequently to bolster 
the name identification and image of their senders.  For instance, the 
"guidelines" (which do not carry the full force and effect of 
regulations) that the Commission issued limiting all mailings to two 
pictures of the sending Congressman per page and eight mentions of his 
or her name (not including use of the name in the frank proper, the 
masthead, the return address, a photo caption, a reprint from the 
Congressional Record, or a signature) not only illustrates the self-
promotional potential of the frank for incumbents, but also raises 
disturbing questions about the extent of such use before any reforms 
were issued. 
 <P>
          Although the word  frank is derived from the Latin for free 
(francus), franked mail is decidedly not free.  As computer and 
printer technology improved in the 1970s and 1980s, making it easier 
to send targeted direct mail and produce impressive postal patron 
mailings, the use of the frank exploded.  Between 1972 and 1988, 
yearly franking costs increased,   after adjusting for inflation, by 
86  percent.  During the 1980s, Congress spent from a low of $43 
million per year to a high of $113 million per year on taxpayer-funded 
postage.  House franking has risen in every election year by an 
average of 64 percent from the previous year since 1980. In 1993, for 
example, House franking costs totaled $24.6 million, which grew to 
$42.3 million in 1994 -- a 72 percent increase.  Franking trends 
show a decided drop beginning in the early 1990s.  Although causation 
is difficult to prove, the 1990 rules requiring individual office 
disclosure of franking amounts (and the attendant embarrassment that 
comes from a great deal of franking) probably had something to do with 
the drop.  Franking costs, however, remain well above their pre-mass 
mailing level. 
 <P>
          Potential for abuse of the frank is noticeably smaller in 
the Senate, which in 1994 prohibited its use in conjunction with mass 
mailings in most cases.  One exception is that Senators may divert up 
to $50,000 from their clerk-hire account to fund mass mailings.  This 
approach at least forces lawmakers to trim staff if they want to send 
out mass mailings.  Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) has been instrumental 
in Senate passage of this and several other franking reforms since 
1989; besides curbing mass mailings, their primary effect has been to 
mandate detailed disclosure of franking practices. 
 <P>
          The House Oversight Committee's franking reform will cut up 
to nearly $24 million yearly from congressional budgets.  But this is 
not the only reason to reform the frank.  Equally important is the 
abuse of "free" congressional mail as a quasi-campaign tool.  
Endangered incumbents routinely use the frank to supplement their 
campaign mailings.  The National Taxpayers Union calculated last year 
that the 37 most endangered House incumbents (as determined by 
political analyst Charles Cook) spent, on average, three times as much 
on franking as the 27 retiring Members just before the 1994 elections.  
Franking essentially represents public funding for congressional 
candidates -- but for incumbents only.  The frank has long served as 
the foundation for the structure of taxpayer-funded incumbent 
advantages, and its widespread use likely helps explain the 90 percent 
reelection rate that House Members have enjoyed for decades.  In 1992, 
three of the four top House frankers lost their reelection bids, which 
suggests that these Members understood their political troubles and 
used public funds liberally to try to counteract them. 
 <P>
          Enormous subsidies for congressional mail reshape the 
playing field in incumbents'  favor in addition to expanding the 
federal budget.  Defenders of big franking budgets typically argue 
that Members of Congress must answer constituents' concerns by mail.  
This is true but essentially irrelevant.  While in the Senate, 
California Governor Pete Wilson estimated that over 90 percent of 
franked mail is initiated by Congress, not by constituents.  Former 
Maryland Senator Charles McC.  Mathias estimated in 1982 that mass 
mailings constituted 96 percent of Senate mailings that year.  In 
1994, the House sent out 267 million pieces of mail but received only 
41 million pieces -- 15 percent of the amount it sent out.  Most 
franked mail is in the form of mass-mailed leaflets that provide 
information to every household in the district -- essentially 
advertising brochures designed to place the incumbent in the best 
possible light.  Although some Congressmen argue that their districts 
need regular mass mailings to be informed about what is happening in 
Washington, it is difficult to argue that the government should 
provide news services or that Members of Congress are politically 
neutral sources. 
 <P>
          The Oversight Committee's cuts in franking allocations 
should be the beginning -- not the end -- of the new Congress's 
efforts at franking reform.  The committee is considering proposals to 
expand the pre- election period in which franked mass mailings are 
banned (currently 60 days) and to increase the frequency of franking 
disclosure.  (Ever since quarterly disclosure was mandated in 1991, 
franking has declined steadily.) The 60-day ban is not extensive 
enough.  In 1994, fifteen Members of Congress sent out over 250,000 
pieces of mail each during the week before the ban took effect, at a 
cost of nearly $40,000 per Member.  Such behavior strongly suggests 
that Congressmen are coming as close as possible to the deadline that 
separates permissible from impermissible franking, and thus that the 
deadline should be moved back further. 
<P> 
          Representative Mike Castle (R-DE) has introduced H.  R.  
923, the Franked Mail Savings Act, which would cut the franking 
allowance further and prevent incumbents from flooding their districts 
with mass mail just before the 60-day deadline by banning mass 
mailings during election years.  It would not regulate franked mail 
that responded to constituents' queries.  Several other 
Representatives -- Porter Goss (R-FL), Fred Upton (R-MI), Pat Danner 
(D-MO), Tim Holden (D-PA), Tom Davis (R-VA), and Bernard Sanders (I-
VT) -- also have introduced measures to cut the franking allowance. 
 <P>
          None of these bills, however, approaches the 75 percent cut 
proposed in the last Congress by Representative Bob Inglis (R-SC).  
Even that massive a reduction would not come close to affecting the 
responsive function of the frank, although it would eliminate most 
postal patron mailings. 
 <P>
          A 75 percent cut in the franking allowance would not have 
affected about 20 percent of the 103rd Congress -- those who were the 
lowest frankers -- at all.  In the year from October 1993 to September 
1994, 93 Members, over 1 in 5, spent less than $40,000 -- 
approximately the yearly allowance that a 75 percent cut would entail.  
(This set of frankers contains equal numbers of Republicans and 
Democrats, plus one independent.) This demonstrates that Members can 
respond to constituents and get along with quite a bit less than the 
six-figure annual franking budget that scores of Members claim is 
essential. 
 <P>
          Cutting the franking budget down to size would ensure 
smaller budgets and fairer elections.  The ultimate goal of franking 
reform should be to eliminate mass mailings entirely, and 
Representative Ray LaHood (R-IL) has introduced a measure, H.R.  1137, 
that would abolish them.  The House Oversight Committee's actions and 
Representative Castle's proposals represent healthy steps toward the 
goal of abolition. 
 <P>
          Several other congressional perks are likewise indefensible.  
Getting rid of congressional perks which give electoral advantages to 
incumbents should be at the top of the reform agenda.  For instance, 
the House and Senate Recording Studios, which provide facilities at 
less than commercial rates for lawmakers to produce radio and 
television shows, provide quasi-campaign services which could be 
supplied just as well by the private sector.  They exist primarily to 
make life (and reelection) easier for incumbents.  Furthermore, 
taxpayer funds should not be used to purchase, imprint lawmakers' 
names on, or frank calendars from the U.S.  Capitol Historical 
Society.  Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) has introduced a 
resolution, H.  Res.  24, that would end the yearly practice of 
automatically funding 2,500 calendars per Congressman.  Congress has 
eliminated its yearly purchase and production of agricultural 
yearbooks, and it should do the same with its calendars. 
 <P>
          Personal use of frequent flier miles also should be 
eliminated by the House.  Senators have not been able to take frequent 
flier miles for personal use since the practice was forbidden in 1991.  
Granting lawmakers personal use of their frequent flier miles creates 
an additional incentive for them to spend more on travel.  Permitting 
personal use of frequent flyer miles is essentially no more defensible 
than granting lawmakers personal use of interest derived from savings 
accounts under the control of the federal government.  In general, it 
is difficult to see why Members should be allowed personal benefit 
from exercise of their official duties.  Lawmakers should be 
encouraged to use their frequent flier miles for official business, 
but personal use should be disallowed, both to encourage thrift and to 
remind Members that when their constituents want to fly across the 
country, they have to pay for it. 
 <P>
          Finally, lawmakers no longer should receive free outpatient 
medical care from local area military hospitals.  They are paid a 
generous salary and are given an excellent health care plan that 
allows them to choose from among several different health care 
providers.  There is no reason to perpetuate a policy that further 
isolates lawmakers from the experience of the people who elect them to 
federal office.  Maintaining special privileges for lawmakers that are 
unrelated to the exercise of their legislative duties is simply 
unjustifiable. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF 
 <P>
In the last thirty years, congressional operating costs have 
skyrocketed by 800 percent, partly because of the Capitol's "aides 
crisis."  Since World War II, House and Senate personal staffs have 
increased more than fivefold and sixfold, respectively, while 
committee staffs have increased twelvefold and fourfold.  The 103rd 
Congress's payroll of nearly 40,000 employees contained five 
legislative staffers for every one in the world's second largest 
legislature, the Canadian Parliament.  There are hundreds of taxpayer-
funded congressional staffers whose only job is to create favorable 
press coverage for the Senator or Representative who employs them.  
The large number of aides who perform quasi-campaign work for their 
employers almost certainly is related to the historically 
unprecedented rates of reelection that incumbent Congressmen have 
enjoyed over the last two decades.  Public outrage at an overstaffed, 
overpaid, and oversupplied-with-perquisites Congress forced majority 
Democrats in the 103rd Congress and majority Republicans in the 104th 
to respond in varying degrees to calls for cuts. 
 <P>
          The House leadership in the 103rd Congress promised a 4 
percent staff reduction, but their performance left much to be 
desired.  The first round of cuts relied heavily on elimination of 
peripheral staff positions, such as interns and distributors of office 
furniture and supplies.  Representative Charlie Rose (D-NC), then 
Chairman of the House Administration Committee,   accomplished one 
especially misleading series of staff cuts by transferring control 
over the   employees of several congressional cafeterias to private 
contractors.  This  bureaucratic maneuver enabled Rose to take credit 
for staff cuts while ensuring that the number of Capitol employees 
would remain the same, with the only change a recasting of the 
official payroll.  Cosmetic reductions like these were joined to 
reductions in non-legislative staff, while legions of highly paid 
personal and committee staff escaped unscathed. 
 <P>
          Leaders of the 104th Congress have embarked upon a more 
serious attempt to cut staff.  In the House, Members voted to cut 
committee staffs by one-third, partly by eliminating three committees 
and twenty-five subcommittees, leading to a 30 percent reduction in 
overall House committee spending.  When added to the elimination of 
fourteen subcommittees during the previous Congress, these reforms 
constitute a good first start at reducing the redundant scrutiny and 
special-interest influence that the cumbersome committee structure 
breeds.  On the other side of the Capitol, the Chairman of the Rules 
and Administration Committee, Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), has 
implemented the Republican Conference's recommendation to cut 
aggregate Senate committee spending by 15 percent.  While these cuts 
are a strong first step, they fail to address lawmakers' overgrown 
personal staffs.  
 <P>
          A central reason that large congressional staffs pose a 
danger to representative democracy is that they serve too often as 
campaign teams.  In some cases, "volunteer" campaign work is a sub 
rosa condition of hire.  Even when it is not, staffers have a very 
strong interest in seeing their boss get reelected.  Congressional 
staffers are prohibited from making financial contributions to their 
employers' reelection campaigns.  Many, however, are bribed or 
dragooned into "volunteer" campaign work.  Employees of any particular 
lawmaker should be prohibited from doing campaign work for that 
lawmaker along the lines of the recently revised Hatch Act.  
Alternatively, a less intrusive (but also less effective) reform would 
be to prohibit the use of public funds for aides' travel between 
Washington, D.C., and the Member's district in the 90 days before any 
primary or general election. 
 <P>
          Regardless of campaign abuses, however, Congress remains 
overstaffed.  The cuts in House and Senate committee staff did not 
affect large personal staffs.  Indeed, one of the rules reforms the 
House passed on the first day of the 104th Congress actually may have 
had the perverse effect of increasing personal staff.  Abolition of 
legislative service organizations (LSOs) -- special-interest 
congressional caucuses that were permitted office space, use of House 
equipment and services, and access to Members' clerk-hire accounts -- 
was billed by reformers as an economy measure that would save as much 
as $5 million yearly.  LSO funds, however, came out of personal office 
budgets, which were not reduced when the LSOs were abolished.  As a 
result, many congressional offices have used the freed-up funds to 
hire new staff. 
 <P>
          A retinue of personal staffers for each lawmaker leads 
inevitably to a more activist and intrusive government, as well as to 
a dispersal of decision-making authority to unelected aides.  Clerk-
hire and franking accounts for each Senator and Representative should 
be combined, and their total should be reduced.  This will allow each 
Member to decide whether he wants to spend money from a smaller pool 
on postage or on staff.  A 10 percent cut would be a reasonable start.  
Roughly half the money saved could be used to establish a central 
office with primary responsibility for routine constituent requests, 
such as furnishing copies of federal legislation, helping with 
passport problems, and addressing simple problems with Social Security 
or veterans benefits.  Such an office would remind lawmakers that 
their job is fundamentally legislative in nature; it would also remove 
a heavy clerical burden from overworked congressional staffers. 
 <P>
          Constituent service not only distracts legislators and their 
staff from the work they were elected to do, but also undermines 
competitive elections by permitting incumbents to take credit for 
nonpartisan good works that obscure their legislative record.  
Professor Morris Fiorina has estimated that casework accomplishments 
add 5 to 10 percent to incumbents' vote totals because of gratitude 
for constituent services.  Nearly one out of every five congressional 
staffers deals exclusively with constituent service; one House 
lawmaker estimated that his office had directly assisted over 600 
constituents in the first six months of his term.  Easing the burden 
of constituent service borne by congressional staffers would encourage 
Congress to concentrate on legislation that benefits the entire 
country. 
 <P>
CONCLUSION 
 <P>
Congress should end wasteful, inefficient spending and perquisites 
that separate lawmakers from their constituents, promote career 
politics, and foil fair elections.  Action on the political reform 
that the American public has demanded is beginning to materialize, as 
shown by the 22 states that passed term limits legislation and the 
provisions of the Contract with America that provided for 
congressional committee and staff reductions.  These actions are good 
first steps, but Congress should continue to reform its own pay, 
pensions, perks, and staff.  Particularly, it should: 
 <P>
Eliminate the automatic pay raise mechanism currently in effect; 
 <P>
Prohibit its own members from receiving payment for extended unexcused 
absences; 
 <P>
Establish a defined contribution pension system that forces career 
legislators either to leave with their old pensions or to continue 
without them, thus saving taxpayers money and reducing incentives for 
congressional careerism; 
 <P>
Curtail franked mass mailings from House Members through a 75 percent 
cut in the franking allowance; 
 <P>
End support of all congressional perquisites, such as personal 
recording studios and calendars mailed out at taxpayers' expense, that 
appear to have no genuine legislative function; 
 <P>
Disallow personal use of frequent flier miles acquired on official 
business; 
 <P>
Prohibit Members from receiving free outpatient medical care from 
local area military hospitals; 
 <P>
Discourage aides from performing campaign reelection work, either 
through simple prohibition of the practice or tighter regulation of 
staff travel; and 
 <P>
Cut clerk-hire budgets by 10 percent, using some of the savings to 
create a central constituent service office to handle routine 
requests. 
 <P>
These reforms are needed to bring Congress more in contact with the 
challenges faced by average citizens, to help restore Americans' trust 
in government, and to eliminate the tremendous, taxpayer-funded 
advantages incumbents use to defeat challengers.  Elimination of these 
advantages, in addition to saving taxpayers money, would represent 
true campaign finance reform by diminishing the overwhelming 
advantages incumbents enjoy in elections.  Perhaps even more 
important, such reforms would force lawmakers to oversee more programs 
and enterprises of the federal government directly, rather than leave 
them in the hands of unelected staffers.  Reformers who seek genuinely 
competitive elections and a more efficient, representative, and 
deliberative Congress should place cuts in congressional pay, perks, 
pensions, and staff at the top of their agenda.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT></B>f 1992 was the "Year of the Woman" in American politics, then 1994 was the 
"Year of the Conservative Woman." Nine women incumbents--all liberal Democrats--
lost their House seats in the November elections. Seven conservative Republican women 
were elected to the House freshman class, while moderate Republican Olympia Snowe 
moved from the House to the Senate.</P>
<P>	The new Republican women in the House do not claim sisterhood with the so-
called "women's agenda." Instead, they define the GOP's Contract with America as a 
"women's issue," and their campaigns centered on tax cuts, congressional reform, and 
reducing or eliminating scores of government programs and entire agencies. Sue Myrick, 
a two-term mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, was named to the House Budget 
Committee because of her experience controlling municipal spending. She's also a co-
chairman of the GOP "freshmen task force" to eliminate the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. Since the mid-1960s, she says, HUD and other federal agencies 
have spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty, and poverty won.</P>
<P>	Barbara Cubin of Wyoming and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho intend to protect 
women and men alike by calling for an overhaul of federal regulation. They've been 
active in the effort to defend property owners from intrusive federal regulators, and to 
give states more flexibility in controlling natural-resources development on public lands 
within their borders. Both Chenoweth and Cubin are on the GOP task force to reform the 
Endangered Species Act to protect animals and plants without jeopardizing jobs or 
property rights. Sue Kelly, of New York's Westchester County, is the only pro-choice 
woman in the crowd, and styles herself an economic conservative. She'll be pushing tax 
and regulatory relief for small businesses.</P>
<P>	These women participate in the first Republican-led Congress in 40 years, which 
offers them unprecedented opportunities for influence. Policy Review looks at three of 
the new lawmakers, who should be on anyone's list of members to watch in 1995 and 
beyond:</P>

<P><B>Andrea Seastrand (CA-22)</B></P>
<P>	For many, the death of a spouse means a time for quitting--a time when long-held 
hopes are wrapped up and put into storage. Not for Andrea Seastrand.</P>
<P>	When her husband Eric, a California assemblyman, died in their 26th year of 
marriage, Seastrand ran for his seat and won. They were a team, "movement 
conservatives" devoted to making government work, by fighting bureaucracy and red 
tape. But it was always Eric who worked in the limelight of elected office. She was 
supportive, in the background, stuffing envelopes and going door to door. "I was the one 
writing the letters and getting others to write," she says. "I never saw myself as the one to 
receive the letters."</P>
<P>	She would be receiving a lot of them. Elected in 1990, Andrea served four years 
in the General Assembly. Then, last year, she saw an opportunity to run for the Santa 
Barbara-area congressional seat vacated by Michael Huffington in his bid for the U.S. 
Senate. She ran on the Contract with America and immigration reform, calling for 
speeding up the deportation of illegal aliens convicted of and imprisoned for serious 
crimes. She supported Proposition 187--the state ballot initiative to end state services to 
illegal immigrants--because she thinks legal aliens are most likely to play by the rules 
and build lives for themselves and their families. "I'm a believer in immigration--legal 
immigration," she says. "I want to help people who are here legally to work through the 
red tape to become citizens more quickly."</P>
<P>	Seastrand's political education began at the all-girls Catholic high school she 
attended in Chicago. During a visit to the school, a bishop who had been exiled from 
Lithuania explained what communism meant in his country, and described the deadening 
effect of a totalitarian government on its citizens. The experience made the 15-year-old 
staunchly anti-Communist. The nuns at school gave Seastrand what might be called a 
practical civics lesson: "No matter where you come from, no matter what your 
background, if you use your God-given abilities and talents, and work hard, the sky is the 
limit to what you can achieve." This simple principle has affected her views on 
everything from welfare reform to school choice.</P>
<P>	The former elementary-school teacher learned another lesson from her nuns: The 
importance of living by example, of mentoring young people in basic conservative values 
of family and citizenship. Fulfilling a promise with her husband, Andrea has continued 
"adopting" students, taking them under her wing for national conventions and boosting 
their involvement in civic life. Her students typically serve as interns in her office, 
community volunteers, and political and neighborhood activists. One of the students she 
took to the Republican National Convention in 1984 is now her congressional district-
office director. An immigrant from Mexico who once served as an intern is now a Wall 
Street banker. Another former intern is a lobbyist in California for a transportation trade 
association.</P>
<P>	Shortly after the death of her husband, Andrea established the Eric Seastrand 
Memorial Youth Fund, using her skills at grassroots political organizing for non-political 
community-outreach projects. Her fund has benefitted dozens of students by providing 
scholarships, supporting 4-H programs, buying a wheelchair to enable a child to 
participate in the Special Olympics, and supplying train tickets for grade-school field 
trips.</P>
<P>	Like most freshman Republicans, Seastrand's immediate objective is to pass all 
provisions in the Contract With America. But her top legislative priority is to free the 
commercial space-launch industry from the bureaucratic maze of regulation by 
overlapping agencies. She's sponsoring a bill that would create a single agency for 
oversight and regulation, and permit tax-exempt bonds to fund the conversion of obsolete 
military bases into spaceports.</P>
<P>	Her plan would require no direct federal expenditures. Seastrand says her bill 
would help the U.S. compete in the global market for commercial launches, and create 
high-tech jobs in a depressed area severely hurt by base closures and declining military 
expenditures. As a state legislator, Seastrand successfully pushed through commercial 
spaceport legislation, creating the California Spaceport Authority and the first 
commercial spaceport in the nation at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In Congress, she has 
secured positions on the two committees that would handle this issue: Science and 
Transportation.</P>
	
<P><B>Linda Smith (WA-3)</B></P>
<P>	The House Republican leadership calls her "the woman who wouldn't blink." 
When the House wrangled over the Balanced Budget Amendment, Linda Smith insisted 
that it include a provision to prevent Congress from raising taxes without a three-fifths 
majority vote. It was a daring move for a freshman, for it amounted to a rebellion against 
the leadership of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey. Though the tax-limitation provision 
was part of the Contract, its most vocal supporters soon backed off when it became clear 
that it lacked broad congressional support. But not Smith and a handful of her colleagues. 
They convinced the GOP leadership to promise to vote next year on whether tax hikes 
should require a three-fifths majority.</P>
<P>	This came from a woman who didn't even run for Congress. Ten days before the 
primary in her congressional district in southwest Washington, the leading GOP 
candidate suddenly withdrew. Smith, a state legislator, was persuaded to run as a write-in 
candidate because she had organized a strong grass-roots base of more than 10,000 
volunteers. Smith's volunteers hit the streets and got out the vote. She won the primary as 
the first successful write-in candidate in state history, and then won the general election 
with 51 percent of the vote.</P>
<P>	 During her tenure in the state legislature, Smith launched two successful state 
ballot initiatives. The first, concerning campaign-finance reform, ushered in a new code 
of conduct for incumbent legislators, and outlawed public financing of elections. </P>
<P>	The other, the Taxpayer Protection Act, imposed a limit on state government 
spending, and called for voter approval of tax increases.</P>
<P>	That sort of lawmaking gets noticed in the new Congress: Two weeks after Smith 
came to Washington, Representative Jan Meyers tapped her to be chairman of the Small 
Business Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance. The best way to promote small 
business, she argues, is to get government out of the way. One of her top priorities is to 
reduce capital-gains taxes to lighten the load on small businesses and spur economic 
growth.</P>
<P>	Years spent navigating the federal tax system motivates this agenda: Smith 
worked as a tax planner in Washington state for 16 years, without giving politics much 
thought. In 1983, after a series of tax hikes, Smith watched her state legislature double 
the tax rate on small businesses. That's when she decided to leave the tax-consulting 
business to get into the tax-limitation business. Not only did Smith, with no political 
experience, run for a seat in the state Assembly, but she ran against a veteran in a 
Democratic stronghold--the man who'd cast the deciding vote to raise taxes. Her own 
party assured her that a conservative woman had no chance of getting elected in her 
district. Nevertheless, she won in a landslide. After four successful years in the state 
Assembly, Smith ran for the state Senate against an incumbent considered unbeatable. 
Again, she shocked her political opponents. Her come-from-behind victory helped give 
state Republicans their first legislative majority in 33 years.</P>
<P>	There is no way to explain Smith's political successes outside of her populist 
appeal. She describes her mission in Washington in the simplest of terms: "Clean up 
Congress, get rid of the debt, and secure our future." If Smith sponsors even half as much 
legislation as she shepherded in her home state, she'll be known as one of the most 
reform-minded House members in recent history.</P> 
<P>	In addition to tax reform, she wants to enact a campaign-finance reform plan that 
prohibits the transfer of political funds from one person's campaign to another. She 
believes that candidates alone should be responsible for their fundraising activities. This 
widespread practice, if outlawed, would cut against the grain of all members, regardless 
of party affiliation. It would mean that in a tight race, where an infusion of last-minute 
cash might influence the outcome, a candidate's campaign could no longer receive 
thousands of dollars in surplus funds from another politician's war chest. </P>
<P>	Smith would restrict out-of-state campaign contributions to less than half of a 
candidate's financing. She would subject political-action committees to the same 
restraints currently placed on individual contributors--$1,000 per election cycle, rather 
than the current $5,000. She wants to prohibit incumbents from using the congressional 
frank for mass mailings of constituent newsletters within three months prior to an 
election. Believing that politicians have the million-dollar advantage over their 
challengers--by way of a taxpayer-funded congressional budget--Smith contends that 
bulk mailings unfairly boost an officeholder's name identification.</P>
<P>	Smith is not known as a compromiser. Critics say that her stubbornness in 
pushing through her agenda borders on arrogance. Smith, on the other hand, likes to 
remind them that she did not run for office; she was drafted. She says her populist reform 
agenda is part of a larger movement in the newly elected House membership. "Don't 
break the spirit of this freshman class," she warns the GOP leadership. "This spirit is 
what the country needs."</P>

<P><B>Enid Greene Waldholtz (UT-2)</B></P>
<P>	Ever since Utah's Enid Greene Waldholtz was elected to Congress, she has been 
passionately concerned about her job's fringe benefits--she wants to amend, slash, and 
eliminate them. Waldholtz wants all members of Congress to reduce their retirement 
benefits, eliminate automatic pay raises, and roll back their salaries to $89,500--a 31 
percent cut--all in the name of good government.</P> 
<P>	And that's just for starters. She wants Congress to cut its own budget by 25 
percent, return to its former status as a part-time legislature, and restrict the ability of 
lobbyists to wine and dine members and their staffs. "Everything about the federal 
government needs to change," Waldholtz says.</P>
<P>	Her top priority is reform of congressional pensions. Members of Congress now 
receive retirement benefits that are roughly double that of individuals in the private 
sector. Waldholtz has co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the existing plan and replace it with 
a 401(k) employee-contribution plan.</P>
<P>	Talk about putting your money where your mouth is: Waldholtz has declined to 
accept her own congressional pension, and she has refused government-paid health 
coverage. She and her husband will purchase their own coverage until Congress acts on 
meaningful health-care reform, including portability of insurance benefits, for all 
Americans. She is also trying to figure out how to reduce her annual salary or funnel the 
difference between her current pay and her proposed salary toward charity or reducing 
the debt. She specifically intends to prevent the money from returning to the House 
Speaker's slush fund, the current repository of all unspent funds from congressional 
budgets.</P>
<P>	Although critics contend that she is feigning sacrifice, because of her personal 
wealth, she argues that to effect real political change on Capitol Hill, "the government 
must lead by example." She says it is essential that members "show that we are cutting 
our own budget, that we are living under the same conditions and rules that people in the 
rest of the country are."</P> 
<P>	Reform of congressional pay and benefits is vital, says Waldholtz, when Congress 
is asking sacrifices of its constituents in order to control federal spending and eliminate 
the deficit. Waldholtz says voters in her 2nd district of Utah understand the need for 
shared sacrifice; they know the budget cannot be balanced painlessly. "People in my 
district will support reduction in government even if it means fewer benefits to some of 
them," she says, "as long as they know Congress did it in a fair way, that they were not 
unduly penalized, or asked to take more than their fair share of the burden." </P>
<P>	Waldholtz, a longtime conservative on social issues, was a Bush supporter in the 
1980 presidential race who has since become more conservative on fiscal issues as well. 
She is a good listener, has the negotiating skills of a diplomat, and is well respected by 
both conservatives and centrists within the GOP. This is perhaps one reason why Newt 
Gingrich gave her a highly coveted slot on the Rules Committee, the gatekeeping body 
that determines which legislation makes it to the floor for debate. The first freshman 
appointed in over 80 years, she represents a part of a coalition charged with helping to 
shape legislation to appeals to a majority of the Congress.</P>
<P>	When it comes to welfare reform, for example, such a coalition will need both her 
experience and her bargaining skills. While serving as the deputy chief of staff to Norman 
Bangerter, a Utah governor, she served as his liaison for social services and spent a great 
deal of time in welfare offices talking to case workers and welfare recipients. Her 
conclusion: "The current welfare system verges on immoral," she says. "It penalizes 
people for getting married, for holding a job, and for acting responsibly. It also 
encourages recipients to have more children out of wedlock. The system is completely 
backwards, and it traps people in poverty."</P>
<P>	All of these women gained national office through more than hard work, or savvy 
campaigning, or the incompetence of their opponents. They were propelled by a common 
disgust for the status quo in Washington--a disdain shared by an overwhelming majority 
of the voting electorate last November. As Waldholtz puts it, "The federal government 
has created a hostile atmosphere for states, for communities, and for families to take care 
of themselves."</P>
<P>	Undoing this state of affairs is not thought of as an issue on a women's-rights 
agenda. But it has become the central issue for these women, because they see themselves 
not only as women, but as citizens. That may make them our best hope for bringing more 
citizenship, and less tribalism, into our politics.</P>

INTRODUCTION
  <P>   As American children begin another year of school, Congress is
ending its two-year session, making it time for a final report card. 
In the critical area of congressional reform -- the steps Congress
took to fix its internal problems -- mostly failing grades are in
order. 
 <P>    The tumultuous elections of 1992 led to the largest freshman
class of legislators in decades; for most of them, reforming the
troubled institution they were about to join was a central campaign
issue.  Lawmakers, conceding that their institution was plagued by
numerous internal problems, created a special committee -- the Joint
Committee on the Organization of Congress -- to reform the
institution.  Even though that committee's proposals were
disappointingly mild, they were fought bitterly by entrenched
interests within Congress and ultimately were sabotaged by
congressional leaders who stopped most reforms from even coming up for
a vote.  In retrospect, it appears that the Joint Committee process
was designed to fail; and, with a few notable exceptions, Members of
Congress expended little time or energy on reforms outside that
process.  Among the disappointments of the last two years, Congress:
<P>
Failed to improve its misleading budget procedures;
<P>
Did not fully apply all relevant federal laws to itself;
<P>
Failed to eliminate congressional perquisites that are used to
influence elections;
<P>
Advanced campaign finance reform that would give incumbents even more
advantages in elections;
<P>
Failed to rationalize the ineffective committee system;
<P>
Failed to eliminate party politics from internal congressional
administration;
<P>
Failed to eliminate deceptive voting practices through truth-in-voting
reforms; and
<P>
Failed even to address congressional term limits.
<P>
     This general pattern of failure is the result of opposition from
an entrenched leadership which dominated a large freshman class that,
despite campaign promises, appeared to care little about reform
issues.  This pattern, however, was interrupted occasionally by a few
individual and institutional bright spots.  The House passed a bill
applying various employment laws to Congress (a bill now being
championed in the Senate by Republican Charles E.  Grassley of Iowa
and Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut), and a few subcommittees
and non-legislative committees were eliminated.  Some members of the
Joint Committee, such as David Dreier (R-CA) and Jennifer Dunn (R-WA),
distinguished themselves on numerous reform fronts; other Members of
Congress, such as Robert Andrews (D-NJ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Inhofe
(R-OK), and Bill Zeliff (R-NH) have capitalized on specific reform
opportunities.  But these legislators unfortunately are not typical. 
Indeed, if Congress were a school, most of the class would need to be
held back in order to take remedial classes on reform.
<P>
CONGRESS'S REFORM COMMITTEE
House:  F Senate:  F
<P>     The central focus of congressional reform must be the quality of
legislation that Congress produces; that is, are laws the product of
sound policy choices made in a genuinely representative fashion? 
Judged by this standard, the process that Congress set up to reform
itself (like its routine lawmaking procedures), was destined to fail. 
Despite rhetorical support for the reform process from nearly every
Member of Congress, obstacles within the process stacked the deck
against reform.
<P>     The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, created to
review and recommend changes in the way Congress operates, originally
had no freshman members -- despite the fact that one-quarter of House
Members and 14 of 100 Senators were first-termers.  Only after one of
its members left Congress to enter the lobbying sector was a freshman
Representative appointed to the 24-member committee.  The fact that
the committee was stacked with senior members (their average tenure
was over fourteen years) reflects a central problem of Congress's
seniority system:  junior members rarely are granted seats on
important legislative committees and are given little opportunity to
do their central job, helping to write legislation.  They therefore
must focus on seeking repeated re-election -- and frequently on
accomplishments unrelated to legislation -- in order to acquire
committee positions with significant legislative influence.  The
overwhelming number of senior lawmakers guaranteed that the Joint
Committee would reflect the attitudes and interests of career
politicians.
 <P>    If the outcome of the reform process had matched the rhetoric of
the Members who testified before the Joint Committee, it would have
been a success.  Over the first six months of 1993, the Joint
Committee held 36 hearings and heard testimony from 243 witnesses --
including 170 federal legislators -- about what was wrong with
Congress.  Most witnesses encouraged the committee to produce a bold
package of reforms and pledged their strong support; Speaker of the
House Tom Foley, for instance, said:  "I have come to believe that
this is a process that not only can work but must work.  I pledge to
you my willingness to support you in any way that I can, and I wish
you well." (Congressional Record, August 10, 1994, p.  H-7332.)
 <P>    Despite this rhetorical support, however, the Joint Committee's
recommendations would have to go through the very legislative process
that the committee had been set up to reform -- a process which
created countless opportunities for other committees to bottle up,
ignore, or fatally modify reform legislation with no guarantee that it
would ever reach the floor of the House and Senate.  Awareness that
any reform plans would have to be acceptable to other committees
encouraged a timid atmosphere that produced tepid half-measures
coupled with schemes to evade pressing issues.
 <P>    For instance, the committee never seriously considered the
reforms that are most prominent in public discourse, such as term
limits, a balanced budget amendment, and line-item veto power for the
President.  Members decided to bypass such difficult questions as
ethics reform, application of laws to Congress, and committee
restructuring by calling for more study or for others to handle the
issue. 
<P>     Although the extensive hearings held in the first six months of
the 103rd Congress were supposed to culminate in a summer legislative
mark-up, the House leadership repeatedly refused throughout the latter
half of 1993 to permit the committee to meet in order to report out
legislation.  This delay eventually led to a November meeting where
frustrated Senate members of the Joint Committee split off and held
their own mark-up, thus further weakening prospects for a strong
reform bill that would permit committee members to form a united front
in its defense.  The House half of the committee, finally scheduled to
meet during the last week of the 1993 session (after which its
authority would expire), was split by a series of party-line votes
that left few genuine reform proposals intact.  Instead, House members
produced a bill larded with feel-good but nonbinding resolutions and
nearly meaningless reforms, such as recodifying House rules and
preventing cosmetic changes in Members' statements in the
Congressional Record.
 <P>    Republican committee members, who could have killed the package
on a party-line vote, were divided on whether the resulting package
was worth any additional effort.  Based on a commitment from Chairman
Lee Hamilton (D-IN) to bring the entire Joint Committee package to the
floor with "generous" opportunities for members of both parties to
amend it, two Republicans -- Vice Chairman David Dreier (R-CA) and
Bill Emerson (R-MO) -- voted to report out the committee product.
 <P>    Although the Joint Committee's proposals were disappointing
overall, the House and Senate reports did include some useful reforms. 
Particularly, proposals for a two-year budget process and limits on
committee memberships likely would have led to greater deliberation
and some reduction in redundancy.  Further, the committee's proposals
could have served as the basis for debate and votes on more
significant reforms in the House and Senate.  The bill's forced march
through House and Senate committees, however, gave defenders of the
status quo opportunities to destroy even these few useful reforms. 
Entrenched interests in both bodies mobilized to fight the Joint
Committee's already weak product. 
<P>
Committee chairmen opposed provisions that might eliminate committees.
     Appropriations Committee members were against a biennial budget
     process. 
<P>The Black Caucus spoke out against committee assignment limitations. 
<P>
The House Democratic Study Group demanded abolition of the Senate
     filibuster before any House reform could take place. 
<P>
The Senate Rules Committee stripped the two-year budget process
     proposal and the committee reforms from their bill, and watered
     down the provisions on application of laws to Congress while
     adding new powers for the Majority Leader and the Appropriations
     Committee. 
<P>
In the House, Speaker Foley decided to break the reform package into
     separate pieces, making it harder to pass each particular reform.
  <P>   
Faced with such legislative roadblocks, the reform bill's momentum
     crumbled.  As a result, the only proposition Congress has even
     considered is the House-passed Congressional Accountability Act
     (see section on "Congressional Coverage," on page 8). 
<P>
     Congressional leaders, all too aware of how to capitalize on
anti-reform legislative dynamics, were able to slice away at the
package's provisions and prospects.  If reformers did not understand
this initially, the leadership's opposition to and destruction of
their efforts certainly should have taught them.  This anatomy of the
Joint Committee's procedural failures carries within it a central
lesson:  any serious reform measure will encroach on so many power
bases and entrenched interests that the only hope of success lies in
bypassing existing committees and seeking votes on the floor of the
House and Senate.
<P>
COMMITMENT TO REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   Despite low and steadily sinking public regard for Congress (as
of August 1994, only 14 percent of the public generally trusts it to
do the right thing, down from 24 percent two years earlier (Associated
Press Poll taken August 26-30 by ICR Survey Research.)) coupled with
broad public support for a wide-ranging spectrum of proposed reforms,
individual Members -- with a few exceptions -- have failed to take the
initiative to reform Congress.
<P>     One problem is that Congressmen apparently are not even
discussing reform to any significant degree.  Among the 5,400 "Dear
Colleague" letters -- internal communications among Members of
Congress -- sent between June 1993 and June 1994, congressional reform
was mentioned only 27 times, ranking 37th among 38 topics.
(Congressional Connection database service.)  For every "Dear
Colleague" that dealt with the issue, there were over 26 that dealt
with health care and over 16 that dealt with crime.  Even when
addressing constituents, Congressmen rarely mention reform.  A
Heritage Foundation review of twenty Congressmen's mass mailings found
crime addressed 44 times, health care 40 times, and senior citizens'
and veterans' concerns a total of 26 times, while congressional reform
was mentioned in only 4 instances.
 <P>    This inaction is startling, given the much-vaunted reform
orientation of the huge freshman class of 1992.  Freshman members of
both parties released reform proposals early in 1993, but few Members
have been active since that time.  Freshman Democrats were sidetracked
after Speaker Foley forced them to vote on a wide-ranging package of
anti-reformist rule changes immediately after being sworn into office
in January of 1993.  Promising that the reforms the freshmen proposed
eventually would receive a vote, Foley was able to secure 53 of 55
freshman Democrats' votes on the rules package.  The resulting reform
package, however, was derived heavily from leadership-supported
proposals on campaign and lobbying reform.  The 27 freshman reform
proposals were steered into one, then another committee of the House
Democratic Caucus, which eventually reported five to the full caucus
for further review.  As of this writing, not one of these proposals
has been voted on by the full House.
 <P>    Freshman Republicans approved a package that contained hard-
hitting reforms like term limits, appropriations reform, franking
reductions, supermajority voting requirements for tax increases, and a
balanced budget amendment.  As a class, however, GOP freshmen have
been surprisingly quiet, perhaps because of the oft-delayed promise of
action on a Joint Committee reform package.  The existence of the
Joint Committee provided a convenient justification for inaction by
congressional leaders, who argued frequently that since the committee
was exploring some particular reform, there was no need for action by
the rest of Congress.
 <P>    There were several notable exceptions to this general lack of
commitment, however.  Representative Jim Inhofe (R-OK) led the 103rd
Congress's most successful crusade for reform:  eliminating the
secrecy of the names on House discharge petitions.  Although Inhofe
lacked relevant committee memberships, his willingness to fight within
the House as well as outside of it (he spent hours discussing House
rules on talk radio shows around the country) eventually forced a
lopsided 384-40 vote in favor of full disclosure.  This reform
empowered rank-and-file Members, who -- if they constituted a majority
-- could now force a vote on legislation despite a committee
chairman's wish to block it.  By providing a way to bypass committees,
discharge reform spurred committee action.  When Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) saw that 185 of the necessary 218 Members
had signed the discharge petition for an aircraft liability reform
bill (a bill he had blocked for eight years), he allowed the
legislation through his committee.  The measure received rapid
approval and is now law.  It had enjoyed broad support for nearly a
decade, but the discharge petition had been the missing ingredient. 
 <P>    Representatives Robert Andrews (D-NJ) and Bill Zeliff (R-NH)
introduced the "A to Z Spending Cuts Plan" that would trigger a
special congressional session devoted to spending cuts.  Over 200
Members signed the discharge petition for this measure; although the A
to Z plan was not considered, strong support for the petition forced
House leaders at least to advance weaker budget reform proposals (see
next section).
 <P>    Other reformers were successful in drawing public attention to
abuses of congressional processes.  Representatives David Dreier (R-
CA) and Jennifer Dunn (R-WA) were particularly persistent in trying to
secure House action (and then in publicizing House inaction) on
recommendations of the Joint Committee.  Representative Mike Crapo (R-
ID) introduced "truth-in-voting" reforms that would make individual
Members more accountable for the legislative votes they cast (see
"Truth in Voting," below).  In the Senate, Charles E.  Grassley (R-IA)
has repeatedly attempted to force Congress to apply to itself the same
laws it passes for the rest of the country.  He and Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) currently are fighting for a Senate vote on a measure
that would apply numerous laws to Congress, albeit under internal
enforcement.
<P>     Despite the congressional leadership's furious resistance to
reform and its ability to punish recalcitrant reformers, rank-and-file
Members might have been more successful in promoting change had more
of them been strongly committed to that goal.  For the most part, that
commitment was not apparent in the 103rd Congress.
 <P>         
NOTE:  The failing grade does not apply to a few reform achievers like
the Members mentioned above, who deserve special commendation for
their efforts. 
<P>
BUDGET REFORM<P>
House:  C Senate:  F
 <P>    Congress's track record on managing the federal budget is not
good.  For too long, federal legislators have relied on disguised
spending increases, votes to cut spending that actually save no money,
and legislative gimmicks that circumvent Congress's own spending caps. 
Although the House of Representatives did pass a few tentative
reforms, its efforts barely merit a passing grade, especially since
its votes were taken so late that it is nearly certain the Senate will
not pass companion measures.
<P>     The House took one healthy step, however:  it passed legislation
that, if approved by the Senate, would stop hidden automatic annual
spending increases.  These yearly "baseline" increases are calculated
by government economists, who estimate how much the federal government
will need next year to do everything it did the previous year,
adjusting for economic and demographic changes.  "Baseline budgeting"
permits spending to grow at a remarkable rate; the Medicare baseline,
for example, typically increases over 12 percent annually. (See James
K.  Glassman, "A Bit of Creative Accounting Makes the Budget a Fraud,"
The Washington Post, July 30, 1993, p.  B1.)  When legislators
announce spending cuts, they use these inflated baseline figures,
making it possible for Congressmen to claim credit for cutting
spending while simultaneously engineering large spending increases. 
Eliminating this fraudulent practice has long been a goal of
Representative Chris Cox (R-CA), who made replacement of baseline
budgeting the centerpiece of his Budget Process Reform Act.  This
summer, the House passed H.R.  4604, the Full Budget Disclosure Act
sponsored by Representative John Spratt (D-SC), which would base
budgets on the previous year's actual spending and force legislators
to justify spending increases rather than claim credit for phony
spending cuts.
<P>     The House also passed another useful budget reform this Congress: 
a measure to place tighter controls on emergency spending.  Because
funding for emergencies is not subject to limits which apply to
regular appropriations, well-placed legislators habitually add pork-
barrel items to emergency appropriations.  For instance, the $6.2
billion requested by President Clinton last year for California
earthquake relief was transformed into $11 billion by the time
Congress finished adding such obviously non-disaster items as funding
for a New York train station and pay raises for federal employees. 
The House-passed Emergency Spending Control Act, if passed by the
Senate, would make such budgetary sleight of hand a thing of the past
by requiring that non-emergency spending in an emergency bill comply
with overall spending caps.
<P>     Unfortunately, deceptive voting remains common.  Two notable
reform procedures were blocked by House leaders despite broad public
and congressional support.  The first was designed to solve the
problem of phony spending cuts.  Although Members of Congress
routinely trumpet the amounts they cut from appropriations bills,
these funds are not used to reduce the deficit.  Instead, they are
recycled by appropriations subcommittees into other programs.  Over
$1.3 billion in cuts was diverted in this fashion during 1992 alone. 
The Deficit Reduction Lock Box Act, H.R.  4057, introduced by
Representatives Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Charles E.  Schumer (D-NY),
would earmark individual appropriations cuts for deficit reduction
instead of allowing them to be recycled into further spending.  The
Lock Box Act, one portion of Representative Crapo's program of truth-
in-voting reforms, currently has 151 cosponsors. 
<P>     The A to Z Spending Cuts plan, cosponsored by Representatives
Robert Andrews (D-NJ) and Bill Zeliff (R-NH), would provide for a
special session for votes on whether to defund a wide array of
spending programs; successful spending cuts would be directed to
deficit reduction.  The plan, which has 230 sponsors, nearly achieved
passage but fell 14 signatures short of the 218 needed for a vote on
the House floor.  It was blocked by massive resistance from
congressional barons who oppose any limits on Congress's spending
power, but the vigorous efforts of A to Z proponents forced the
leadership to allow consideration of the mild budget reforms discussed
above.  As Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) characterized it,
"Instead of A-to-Z real spending reforms, we are going to have C-Y-A
process reforms."
 <P>    While useful, internal procedural reforms such as A to Z and the
Lock Box are less effective than constitutional reforms to limit
Congress's spending power.  A balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution and a line-item veto that would permit the President to
strike wasteful federal spending from legislation provide the best
prospects for ridding the federal budget of its pro-spending bias.
(Republican House candidates will pledge on September 27 to support
votes on these two constitutional reforms, as well as other reform
issues, if they elect the leadership of the House in the 104th
Congress.)
  <P>   The Senate debated a balanced budget amendment but narrowly
failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed for passage.  In the
House, even though 337 Members (far more than two-thirds) voted in
favor of some version of a balanced budget amendment, procedural
tricks used by the leadership ensured that no one version would
receive enough support to go forward.  The House did pass a weakened
version of a line-item veto (the Enhanced Rescission Act) that would
permit the President to propose spending cuts, but those cuts could be
blocked by a majority in either the House or the Senate.  (A genuine
line-item veto would require two-thirds of both houses to override
presidential cuts.) Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. 
Byrd (D-WV), however, killed the measure in the Senate.  Some action
on budget reform will be necessary for the Senate to receive a passing
grade.
<P>

CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE<P>
House:  B Senate:  F
<P>     Congress refuses to obey many of the laws it imposes on ordinary
Americans.  Nearly a score of federal laws -- including the Civil
Rights Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, and Family and Medical
Leave Act -- either do not cover Congress at all or apply to Congress
differently than to the rest of the country.  Congress's habit of
exempting itself from laws that burden citizens, businesses, and state
and local governments is fundamentally undemocratic and makes
legislators careless about the regulatory and financial costs of
legislation.  Unlike private sector employees, congressional employees
who allege wrongdoing by their employers face a slow, secretive,
internal congressional process fraught with possibilities for
political interference.  Appeal rights are insufficient and jury
trials nearly impossible.
 <P>   Popular outrage at this double standard led to various
legislative proposals purporting to solve this problem.  The most
popular, the Congressional Accountability Act, was sponsored by
Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Dick Swett (D-NH),
eventually garnering 250 cosponsors.  When the Joint Committee on the
Organization of Congress split into House and Senate groups, House
members incorporated a watered-down version of the Shays-Swett
legislation in the reform bill they produced.  Senate leaders
appointed a Bipartisan Task Force on Congressional Coverage which --
instead of designing legislation -- issued a report advocating half-
measures.  Nine months later, that report still has not been publicly
released. 
  <P>   In August of 1994, the House passed a somewhat improved version
of the Congressional Accountability Act.  The Act gives aggrieved
congressional employees a choice between Congress's internal hearing
system (with an eventual right of appeal to federal appellate court)
or a lawsuit in federal district court with the possibility of a jury
trial.  It also incorporates ten specified employment-related laws and
permits addition of other employment statutes. 
<P>     Although the Congressional Accountability Act is an important
step forward, significant weaknesses remain.  Under the Act, a newly
created Office of Compliance would propose unique regulations for
Congress "that specify the manner in which the laws... shall apply."
(H.  R.  4822, section 5 (c) (1) (A).)  This means that Congress still
will not be following the same laws as the rest of the country. 
Congress will write its own regulations, different from those faced by
the private sector, and it will judge for itself whether those
regulations are sufficient, even as the private sector continues to
face often hostile enforcement of regulations over which it has little
control.  Furthermore, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was
stripped from the bill when it was considered in the House
Administration Committee.  As Representative John Boehner (R-OH) has
contended, the House Bank and Post Office scandals might have been
headed off if FOIA had been applied to Congress.  Applying FOIA to
Congress also could expose such other abuses of power as use of the
congressional frank to influence elections and improper special-
interest communications from Members to federal agencies.  Finally,
the Congressional Accountability Act's application of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act (OSHA) to Congress lacks fines and allows
Congress to delay any necessary repairs for a year or more after a
violation is discovered.  Private businesses ordinarily are not
granted years to cure a violation of federal health and safety law. 
     Unfortunately, Senate agreement to the Congressional
Accountability Act appears unlikely.  The principal Senate objection
is that the new compliance office would have authority over both the
House and Senate; many Senators prefer separate House and Senate
offices.  Even if the Act should become law, however, its cozy
enforcement regime and coverage loopholes leave much room for
improvement.  Nonetheless, recognition that Congress must obey the
laws it imposes on other Americans makes the Congressional
Accountability Act one of the most important reforms to achieve any
success in the 103rd Congress.  Although the Act is flawed, its
enactment would be a significant step forward -- especially in
establishing the principle that Congress is not above the law.
<P>
PAY, PERKS, AND STAFF<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   Congress has become an "incumbent protection society" (The term
is Alan Ehrenhalt's; see The United States of Ambition (New York: 
Random House, 1991), p.  230.) by using taxpayer-supplied public funds
for private political purposes.  Weekend trips back to the district
are funded by one official account, staff who routinely perform
campaign-style work (for example, drumming up media coverage) by
another.  Television and radio studios in congressional office
buildings are funded by taxpayers and used by officeholders to compose
and broadcast programs aired in their districts.  Perhaps most
important, the congressional frank -- "free mail" sent to constituents
-- is worth roughly $160,000 per year for each Member of Congress, an
amount greater than the average House challenger's entire campaign
budget.
<P>     Congress works hard to protect its perquisites, including
Members' salaries -- which now exceed $133,000 a year.  "Ethics
reform" legislation passed in 1989, for instance, provides for yearly
cost of living adjustments (COLAs) in congressional pay, which means
that each Member of Congress receives an annual pay raise without ever
having to vote on the question.  Congress's pension system is one of
the most expansive in the country, roughly twice as generous as any in
a Fortune 500 corporation.  Legislation to repeal the COLA or
otherwise reform congressional pay and benefits languishes with little
support.  Representative John Boehner (R-OH) has brought suit against
the COLA procedure, arguing that it violates the 27th Amendment's
stricture against congressional pay raises without an intervening
election; so far, his efforts have been unsuccessful.  For the most
part, other congressional "perks" remained untouched this session as
well.
<P>     As of mid-September, Representative Jim Lightfoot (R-IA) was
attempting to force a vote eliminating the COLA scheduled for December
1994.  Lightfoot's commendable effort would fix the problem for one
year only, however, since his amendment would be attached to an
appropriation measure.
<P>     The number of congressional employees -- long a subject of public
ire -- did see some small improvement.  Congress employs an army of
aides, now numbering over 27,000, (Norman Ornstein, Thomas Mann, and
Michael Malbin, eds.  ,Vital Statistics on Congress 1993-1994
(Washington, D.C.:  Congressional Quarterly, 1993), table 5-1, p. 
127.  Hereafter referred to as VSOC.) and its staff is by far the
largest of any legislature in the world. (VSOC, p.  121.)  In the last
thirty years, operating costs have ballooned by 800 percent. (VSOC, p. 
124.)  With critics arguing that huge congressional staffs lead to
inefficient and intrusive government, the House of Representatives has
promised to reduce its staff by 4 percent.  Its first round of staff
cuts, however, relied heavily on eliminating peripheral positions,
such as interns and administrative staff (for example, those who
distribute office furniture and supplies).  In an especially cynical
move, Representative Charlie Rose (D-NC), Chairman of the House
Administration Committee, transferred control over congressional food
services employees to private contractors while ensuring that the
services and employees would remain -- leaving the same number of
employees on Capitol Hill, but reducing the official payroll.  While
non-legislative staff shouldered the vast majority of cosmetic
reductions, highly paid personal and committee aides who function as
shadow Congressmen escaped nearly unscathed. 
<P>     The enormous subsidies for congressional mail, which increase the
federal budget and tilt federal elections in favor of incumbents, also
remained essentially unchanged.  Lawmakers should answer constituent
queries, but over nine-tenths of franking costs derive from mass
mailings initiated by Congressmen, not from responses to constituents.
(Senator Pete Wilson, "The Congressional Frank:  A Simple Case of
Abuse," Heritage Lecture No.  221, September 29, 1989, p.  1.) 
Although previous Congresses have cut franking accounts and required
disclosure of Members' total expenditures, such reforms as limiting
the mention of the sender's name to eight per page and capping his
pictures at two per page only raise questions about what prior abuses
had occurred.  Republicans have pressed repeatedly for further reform
of franking, but Rose has refused to hold any committee meetings on
the subject this election year.  The political uses of the frank were
illustrated during the tumultuous 1992 elections, when three of the
four heaviest House users of the frank lost their reelection bids.  On
average, the four sent out over a million mass-mailed letters apiece.
("Use of Franking Privilege," The Washington Post, October 22, 1992,
p.  A29.)  Although these mailings failed to save them, they
demonstrate that those in greatest political peril often use the frank
the most.
<P>     One change symbolizes the whole of congressional reform this
session.  Congress has come under fire for reserving select parking
for Members at Washington airports.  Shortly after a Senate vote
narrowly rejecting a proposal to eliminate the special parking
arrangement, signs acknowledging that the spaces were reserved for
Congressmen were mysteriously altered to read "Restricted Parking: 
Authorized Users Only."  Although one can argue that Members need
special airport parking spaces because of frequent travel, cosmetic
changes that attempt to divert attention from Congressmen's special
status without changing the situation are especially cynical.
  <P>   The solution to these problems is as easy to understand
intellectually as it is difficult to implement politically:  further
regulate or eliminate congressional "perks" susceptible to electoral
abuse.  If Congressmen want a pay raise, make them vote on it.  If
they need a broadcast studio to communicate with their districts, make
them find one in the private sector.  If they want to send what
amounts to political mailings to voters in their districts, make them
pay for it out of campaign funds; abolition of these unsolicited
mailings by members of the House alone would help level the playing
field for challengers and save taxpayers roughly $58 million every
congressional session. (Estimate from National Taxpayer's Union news
release, April 4, 1994.)  A rule that Members of Congress could
respond to, but not initiate, constituent correspondence would do more
for campaign reform than any measure currently being debated in
Congress.  Finally, real cuts -- on the order of 25 percent -- from
committee and personal staff are essential for congressional reform.
(The House Republican pledge discussed in note 5 above also includes a
commitment to reduce committee staff by a third.)
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
 <P>    In 1992 -- a year noted for anti-incumbent sentiment -- over 88
percent of incumbents running for reelection to the House or Senate
were victorious.  (In the previous decade, the average reelection rate
among House incumbents was over 95 percent. (VSOC, tables 2-7 and 2-8,
pp.  58-59.)) Incumbent dominance of congressional elections was
acknowledged by President Clinton, who claimed that his campaign
finance plan "levels the playing field between challengers and
incumbents and pays for it by taxing lobbyists and not the American
people." ("Statement by the President... on Finance Reform," Office of
the Press Secretary, May 7, 1993, p.  2.)  The President's plan and
similar congressional proposals (H.R.  3 and S.  3), however, fail to
meet this standard.  On the central test of campaign finance reform --
giving challengers a fair chance -- these proposals flunk.
 <P>    Instead of leveling the electoral playing field, campaign finance
reform legislation passed by the House and Senate (though not in final
form) would enhance incumbents' already formidable advantages, many of
which are funded by the American taxpayer.  These advantages snowball
when it comes to campaign contributions, because donors prefer to give
to likely winners.  Special interest group political action committee
(PAC) donations to incumbents especially outpace those to challengers,
and the House-passed version of campaign finance reform would heighten
this advantage by prohibiting challengers from offsetting their lack
of PAC contributions with large donations from individuals.  Because
the House scheme limits the number of donations greater than $200 that
a campaign can accept, challengers in effect would be forced to
scramble for funds in $200 increments to match the showers of $5,000
PAC gifts that go to incumbents. 
<P>     Most of the taxpayer-funded advantages enjoyed by incumbents (see
"Pay, Perks, and Staff" above) are ignored by the campaign finance
reform bills.  There is a ban on election-year mass mailings in the
Senate bill, for example, but this probably will be eliminated if the
bill goes to conference.  Instead, these bills limit the amounts that
congressional candidates can spend.  Since these spending caps are
equal for challengers and incumbents , however, they add even more to
incumbents' built-in advantage.  Two decades ago, the Supreme Court
declared that spending limits are an unconstitutional limit on First
Amendment freedoms; (Buckley v.  Valeo, 424 U.S.  1 (1976).) that is
why the bills call their limits "voluntary."  But candidates who
exceed those limits are penalized harshly by such measures as punitive
taxation and awards of hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal
subsidies to opponents.  Since incumbents 'advantages make their
effective spending limits far higher than those of challengers, this
penalty amounts to an ingeniously pro-incumbent ploy.  Incumbents will
not have to exceed the limit -- challengers will.
 <P>    Challengers who try to avoid the problem by running cheaper
campaigns will be effectively disarmed, because it takes a substantial
amount of spending just to reach parity with incumbents' taxpayer-
funded privileges, to say nothing of their natural advantages in media
access and name recognition.  $600,000, the proposed spending limit
for House candidates, is set just where challengers start to become
dangerous.  While a quarter of House challengers who spent between
$400,000 and $600,000 were victorious in the 1992 general elections,
over half of the those who spent over $600,000 won their races. 
Spending limits will shackle challengers by blocking them from
reaching effective spending parity with incumbents, who can tap public
resources for private political purposes. 
<P>     The dangers of the campaign reform plans do not stop with their
profoundly anti-competitive, challenger-stifling provisions.  They
also include direct attacks on free speech and citizen participation
in elections.  President Clinton, for instance, proposed to pay for
his plan's public campaign financing by taxing corporations for the
exercise of their First Amendment rights to petition the government. 
The Senate bill attempts to conceal its public funding by forcing
candidates who do not abide by spending limits to pay punitive taxes
-- for exercising their First Amendment rights -- at the top corporate
rate of 34 percent on all campaign receipts, with the proceeds being
funneled to those who obey the spending limits.
<P>     This double-barreled attack on freedom of speech is only the tip
of the iceberg.  Robert Peck of the American Civil Liberties Union has
argued that there are at least a dozen unconstitutional provisions in
the House bill that stifle political expression.  For instance, it
regulates political expression so broadly that a citizen who wished to
buy a sign supporting or opposing a political candidate could become
ineligible to do so by requesting a copy of the candidate's platform.
("The Devil in Campaign Finance Reform," speech given at the
Conference on Campaign Finance, American University Law School,
February 10, 1994.)  The Senate bill also restricts free speech.  An
amendment offered by Democratic Senator Robert Graham of Florida, for
example, would require anyone who sends out a "communication to the
general public" about a congressional candidate to file copies with
the state and federal governments.  Graham's amendment is drafted so
carelessly that fines could be levied for a letter to the editor of a
newspaper, for a union mailing, or even for a holiday newsletter to
family and friends which comments on a political candidate.
<P>     In short, the regulation of campaigns envisioned in these bills
is intended not to enhance political discourse, but to restrict
political activity to the advantage of incumbents while doing nothing
about the handicaps facing challengers.  This is precisely the
opposite of what real campaign reform should accomplish.  The only
redeeming value of these competing campaign reform packages is that,
because the House and Senate cannot agree on their details, they
appear unlikely to pass.
<P>
COMMITTEE REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
<P>     In 1947, Congress had 38 committees and subcommittees; today,
there are 266.  Over the last two decades alone, committee staffs in
the House of Representatives have grown by 158 percent.  The growth of
committees and their attendant staffs insulates Congressmen from
policy choices and hinders the legislative process by ensuring that
important legislation, because it will have to pass through more
committees, will be subjected to more special-interest group
influence.  Although committee reform was one of the major announced
goals of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, that
panel ultimately proposed only minor tinkering with the committee
system.
 <P>    The House did make some minor progress in downsizing committees. 
In early 1993, it eliminated fifteen subcommittees and four select
committees.  The latter were obvious targets for elimination because
they lacked the power to craft legislation -- the central reason
committees exist.  But real committee reform remains unexplored. 
<P>     Committees function too frequently as legislative roadblocks,
especially when the tenure of their committee chairmen -- who have the
power to set the agenda -- is measured less easily in years than in
decades.  Over 90 percent of House committees, for instance, are
chaired by Members who have served at least ten terms in office. 
Among the popular measures perennially bottled up by hostile committee
chairmen are the balanced budget amendment, the line-item veto, term
limits, and product liability reform.  While House Republicans have
adopted a rule to limit the tenure of their top committee members,
House Democrats -- who control the committees -- have refused to adopt
a similar measure.  The majority party's refusal to enact rules that
would ensure turnover ensures that most chairmen will continue to have
little experience in public life outside of government work.
<P>    Because committee members typically will be willing to put more
energy into defending their committees than other legislators will
devote to abolishing them, the likelihood of collective decision-
making to eliminate more committees is minimal.  Furthermore, the
experience of the Joint Committee suggests that the chairmen of all
endangered committees, recognizing their common interest in the status
quo, will join to block any serious committee reform.  The most
promising route to committee reduction is to reduce the number of each
Members' committee memberships.  When Members are given seats on too
many committees, their legislative participation typically is confined
to frantic journeys between different committee hearings where, in an
attempt to sound informed, they read questions to witnesses written by
their staffs.  House Members should be limited to memberships on two
major committees and four subcommittees thereof; panels whose
memberships drop by half because of these restrictions should be
eliminated.  Senators should be limited to membership on three
committees along the same lines with legislators' preferences thus
determining what committees would be eliminated.
<P>     Not only does an excess of committees and committee memberships
harm deliberation, it also leads to proxy voting, a practice in which
one Member casts votes for another.  Although the Rules of the House
and Senate prohibit one Member of Congress from casting another's vote
on the floor, no such prohibition applies in committees, where proxy
voting is a frequent practice.  In the first year of the 103rd
Congress, for instance, proxies were used in every legislative vote in
such important House committees as Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and
Public Works and Transportation.  Proxy voting encourages members to
vote on legislation without ever hearing arguments for or against it
and makes a mockery of representative government. 
<P>     Finally, committees that handle public business often prevent
public access.  Legislative committees that handle the nation's
business routinely close their doors to observers by majority vote. 
Although confidentiality is defensible in cases involving such
sensitive matters as national security, such subjects are rarely the
reason committee meetings are closed.  The two House committees that
close their doors most frequently are Ways and Means and
Appropriations, both of which must make politically controversial
choices about federal taxation and spending. 
<P>     The attempt to establish an open-meeting rule in the Joint
Committee's reform bill failed on a party-line vote.  Although there
was some provision for weakening the force of proxy votes in the
Senate version of the bill, that bill's demise suggests that no such
reform will take place.  In short, opportunities for reductions in
size and membership, elimination of proxy voting, and establishment of
an open meeting rule for committees were ignored.
<P>
NONPARTISAN HOUSE ADMINISTRATION<P>
House:  F Senate:  N/A
<P>     Scandals in the House Bank and Post Office were significant
catalysts for congressional reform.  In the wake of federal
indictments related to drug dealing in the House Post Office, Majority
Whip Richard A.  Gephardt (D-MO) conceded that the House of
Representatives' administrative functions had been penetrated with
"abuses and management inefficiencies," (Congressional Record, April
9, 1992, p.  H-2547.)and pledged to fix these problems by -- among
other steps -- creating a new congressional office with a nonpartisan
Director of Nonlegislative and Financial Services, subject to
bipartisan oversight.  Gephardt promised that patronage employees in
the House restaurant and computer operations would vanish once
responsibility for them was transferred to the nonpartisan
administrator and the bipartisan oversight structure.  The political
patronage system has produced incompetent but unfireable employees and
allowed partisan abuse of public resources, including distribution of
sensitive information in a partisan fashion, running political errands
on public time (such as picking up campaign contributions), and using
congressional equipment for political campaign mailings.  Implicit in
promises of reform was the idea that the opportunities for massive
patronage and corruption that this army of aides represented would
vanish under nonpartisan administration.
<P>     Over two years after these reforms, however, the patronage system
remains fundamentally unreformed.  The problem lies with an oversight
subcommittee which must ratify decisions of the nonpartisan
administrator for him to act.  Though the subcommittee has equal
numbers of Republicans and Democrats, any deadlock has the effect of
granting decision-making powers to the congressional leadership.  If
the Chairman of House Administration dislikes any subcommittee
outcome, he can simply raise the issue in the full committee, which
routinely defers to its Chairman:  Representative Charlie Rose, who
can -- and often does -- veto any change that threatens the majority
party's political preferences.  The first Director, Leonard P. 
Wishart, attempted to fulfill the office's duties but was repeatedly
rebuffed.
<P>
After responsibility for employees in charge of office equipment and
     supply was transferred to Wishart, he reviewed payrolls and found
     that two employees who had been hired under the patronage system
     were being paid inflated salaries for the work they were doing. 
     In order to make their salaries commensurate with their duties,
     Wishart submitted suggested salary changes.  Rose refused to
     approve the changes.
<P>Rose bypassed the Director by introducing a resolution in his
     committee to contract out the House Restaurant System, despite
     the fact that the restaurant system had been under the Director's
     authority for nearly a year.
<P>Rose refused to cede control over House Information Systems (HIS) --
     the House's internal computer operations -- even though the
     legislation that created the Office of the Director mandated that
     HIS would be transferred to the nonpartisan office.  Apparently,
     the patronage possibilities were simply too tempting to ignore. 
     As of July 1993, HIS had 277 employees drawing an average yearly
     salary of $48,400, which is sharply higher than the average House
     employee's paycheck.  A party-line deadlock in the oversight
     subcommittee continues to block HIS transfer.
<P>
     Wishart resigned abruptly in early 1994, suggesting in his letter
of resignation that some Members were attempting to undercut serious
moves toward neutral congressional administration.  His interim
replacement, Randall Medlock, apparently sees himself as a partisan
functionary not subject to bipartisan oversight.  He has refused to
provide information on franking costs to House Republicans, for
instance, explaining that Rose had ordered him to keep the data
confidential.  More recently, Medlock extended a food service contract
for a House cafeteria without obtaining the required subcommittee
approval.  In stark contrast to the elaborate bidding process required
for federal contract rewards -- which was followed when the House
contracted out the rest of its $9.3 million in food service business
earlier this year -- the million-dollar-a-year contract was extended
to the Skenteris family of North Carolina for an additional five years
without competitive bidding.  The contract originally had been awarded
in 1993 by Rose to his former constituents without competitive
bidding. (Alice A.  Love, "Republicans Blast Renewed Contract for Ford
Cafeteria," Roll Call, September 14, 1994, p.  14.)
 <P>    Abusively partisan administration of the House will not be
eliminated without pressure by an informed public, and congressional
leaders make it difficult or impossible to find out how they manage
their internal affairs.  For instance, the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), which applies to much of the federal government, excludes
Congress.  Both the principle that Congress should be subject to the
laws it writes for everyone else and the public's right to know demand
that Congress comply with FOIA.  Knowing in advance that its internal
operations would be subject to outside scrutiny would encourage
Congress to conduct its affairs with probity.
<P>     Partisan abuse of staff will continue as long as the underlying
problem remains unsolved.  The House needs to do what it promised: 
hire a professional administrator who is not turned into a pawn in a
continuing effort to maintain partisan advantage.  That administrator
must have as his central priority the professionalization of
administrative tasks -- especially including House Information
Services -- and be under the direction of the bipartisan oversight
committee, not a partisan committee chairman.  A deadlock in the
oversight subcommittee should lead to a vote on the floor for
difficult cases, replacing unilateral action by the House
Administration Committee.  This would force partisan disputes to be
debated openly.  Until the commitment to nonpartisan administration
under bipartisan oversight is honored, reforms remain cosmetic and the
Director remains an arm of the congressional leadership.
<P>     The House and Senate both have refused to open their internal
operations and finances to the public through the Freedom of
Information Act, and the House has taken a step backward from reform
by refusing to implement its promise of nonpartisan administration. 
These policies are scandalous and are likely to breed even more
scandals.
<P>
TRUTH IN VOTING<P>
House:  F Senate:  N/A
  <P>   When constituents judge the job performance of Congressmen,
voting records are a central factor.  But Members of Congress, well
aware that their political support can stand or fall with the votes
they cast, have rigged the system to avoid accountability for the
choices they make.  In some cases, they make decisions without ever
voting on them.  In others, they use procedures that make their votes
deceptive or meaningless. 
 <P>    A favorite tactic of the congressional leadership is to
manipulate the rules by which the House of Representatives conducts
its legislative business.  While the rules of the House are generally
fair, they are routinely ignored and can be waived at any time by a
bare majority vote.  A special rule for each piece of major
legislation is crafted in the Rules Committee and then ratified by the
full House.  More often than not, these special rules prevent
pertinent amendments from being considered, making it possible for
legislators to claim they favor popular policies while lamenting the
lack of opportunity to vote on them.  For the last six years, a
majority of special rules have limited amendment opportunities, and
the problem continues to grow:  the percentage of restrictive rules
mushroomed from 15 percent in the 95th Congress (1977-1978) to nearly
three-quarters of all legislation in this Congress. (Congressional
Record, August 10, 1992, p.  H-7330.)
  <P>   An even greater abuse of the legislative process is the
leadership's practice of producing legislation and then forcing votes
almost immediately, so that legislators do not have a chance to read a
bill before voting on it.  Although House Rules require that
legislation be available to Members three days before a vote, this
rule is often waived.  Copies of the 3,000-page, $496 billion tax
increase that Congress passed in 1993 were available to Members for
roughly twelve hours; any Congressman who wanted to read the bill
would have had to scan 250 pages per hour, making decisions at the
rate of nearly $700 million per minute.  More recently, the crime
bill's revised conference report was passed under a rules waiver only
a few hours after it was put together, and the text was unavailable to
most Members until the day after House passage.
 <P>   Another procedural trick creates opportunities for Congressmen to
vote for popular measures without actually advancing them in the
legislative process.  Under a "king-of-the-hill" rule, Members can
vote on a long string of competing legislative proposals, but only the
last one to receive a majority vote becomes law.  When a balanced
budget amendment was considered under a king-of-the-hill rule in the
House, many more than the required two-thirds voted for the amendment,
but it ultimately failed to pass.  The rule permitted Members to
divide their votes among four different proposals, ensuring that any
Member who wanted to take credit for a balanced budget vote could do
so without any risk that the House would pass the measure.  A recent
king-of-the-hill vote on the crime bill permitted Members to vote in
favor of narrowing appeal rights for death row inmates and then,
moments later, to vote in favor of expanding them.  The legislative
significance of such contradictory procedures is dwarfed by their
electoral importance, as legislators can compile a voting record
suitable for nearly any audience.
<P>    Just as some procedures enable Members to vote without
legislative consequences, others allow them to take real action
without votes.  For example, House Members have rigged the budget
process so that they now no longer have to cast a vote on raising the
debt limit if the overall federal budget is out of balance.  Instead,
a procedural vote on the budget is deemed to have legislative
significance.  Last year, a similar procedure was used to enact new
deficit targets for future years without an actual vote.  Whatever one
thinks of the wisdom of such choices, the procedure used to make them
(or, more precisely, to avoid making them) cheats representative
democracy.
<P>     Representative Mike Crapo (R-ID) has introduced truth-in-voting
legislation that would abolish several of these deceptive procedures;
although the bill has 83 cosponsors, the House so far has declined to
act on it. (For a more extensive discussion of truth in voting, see
Dan Greenberg, "It's Time for Truth in Voting," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  977, February 23, 1994.)
<P>      The House needs a five-day waiting period before voting on
legislation, which would create more time for analysis and
improvement; a two-thirds requirement to waive House rules, which
would dampen the current trend towards their subversion; and
elimination of such deceptive voting procedures as the automatic debt
limit hike and the king-of-the-hill rule.  Although some Members
doubtless have an interest in keeping the legislative process as rapid
and secret as possible, this is not an interest that should be
respected.
 <P>    One of the few successful reforms in this Congress was
Representative Jim Inhofe's (R-OK) success in eliminating the secrecy
of the signatures on House discharge petitions (as discussed in
"Commitment to Reform," earlier in the paper).  Disclosing the
signatures on these petitions reveals which Members of Congress
actually support up-or-down votes on legislation that House leaders
wish to sidetrack.  Because this reform changed House Rules and will
lead to more votes on controversial questions, Congress's performance
on truth-in-voting reforms merits a barely passing grade.
<P>
TERM LIMITS

<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   The changes in the legislative process, congressional perks, and
internal administration discussed above are attempts to solve
Congress's central problem:  abuse of power.  For too long, incumbents
have been able to conceal the policy choices they make through
deceptive voting and accounting procedures and cement their reelection
by using taxpayer-funded perks.  Congressional reform must be crafted
and passed by Congress, and incumbents' experience permits them to
design legislation which evades -- or, in some cases, contradicts --
its stated goals.  (See the discussion of congressional coverage and
campaign finance reform above.) Term limits, the best prospect for
real congressional reform, come from outside of Congress; across the
country, strong public support for term limits (74 percent in one
recent poll (Americans Talk Issues poll, January 1994.)) is
counterbalanced only by furious resistance from elected officials.
  <P>   Term limits are the best solution to many of Congress's larger
problems.  Limiting the terms of federal legislators would change the
composition of Congress by attracting candidates with demonstrated
expertise in something besides politics.  Limits would change
legislators' incentives:  citizen-legislators would serve briefly,
focus their energies on solving a few discrete problems, and go home. 
They also would ensure congressional turnover and mandate independent
representation that better reflects the sentiments of the electorate. 
Ever-present concerns about reelection would be removed from Congress
by the deprofessionalization that term limits would bring to American
politics. 
<P>     Despite strong public support for limiting congressional terms,
Congress has refused to act.  Term limits have passed overwhelmingly
in every state that permitted its voters a choice, but the House
Judiciary Committee has held only two inconclusive hearings on term
limits -- two more than were held in the Senate, where limits came up
for a vote only once; a proposed amendment to the campaign finance
reform bill, which would have limited candidates who accepted public
campaign funds to two terms, failed 39-57.
<P>    Generally, legislators prefer to fight term limits in private,
through litigation and by delaying votes on term limit proposals.  The
Senate, for example, voted in 1993 to authorize its legal counsel to
argue against term limits in an Arkansas case that questioned their
constitutionality -- a case currently before the Supreme Court.  Such
use of public resources for political purposes is especially galling
when it flies in the face of the unambiguous majority of the voters. 
Speaker Foley has blocked a House vote on term limits until their
constitutionality is "decided by the courts." ("This Week with David
Brinkley," November 8, 1992, ABC transcript.)  The Speaker's
constitutional scruples do not apply universally, however; he
championed campaign finance reform legislation in the 103rd Congress
despite significant questions about its encroachment on First
Amendment rights.  Congress frequently has approved constitutionally
disputable legislation with special provisions for expedited judicial
review.  Furthermore, Foley is by no means a neutral party in this
case, having sued the voters of his own state in an effort to overturn
their 1992 vote in favor of term limits.
<P>     There are defenders of term limits in Congress, where over 100
House Members have signed a discharge petition that would wrest
control over term limits legislation from the Judiciary Committee. 
That committee is controlled by Texan Jack Brooks, a Member of
Congress since the Truman Administration who is currently running for
a 22nd term.  The elimination of senior committee Members' power to
bottle up for decades any ideas they oppose will be one of the most
salutary effects of congressional term limits.  House Republicans
already have imposed term limits on their top committee members
through an internal party caucus rule. (The House Republican pledge
discussed in note 5 above also includes a commitment for a floor vote
on term limits.)
 <P>    Congress should allow a vote on, and approve, an amendment to the
Constitution that establishes term limits.  This vote should be free
of the procedural roadblocks that characterized the deceptive voting
procedures used by the House earlier this session to foil the balanced
budget amendment.  Until Congress takes action, it deserves opprobrium
for ignoring the most significant political mass movement the United
States has seen for decades. (For a more extensive discussion of term
limits, see Dan Greenberg, "Term Limits: The Only Way to Clean Up
Congress," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 994, August 10, 1994.)
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>     Students who fail their coursework are forced to repeat a grade.
Ideally, incumbents who fail at their assignments should face an even
harsher punishment: removal from office. The 103rd Congress, swept
into office by promises of reform made to the American people, has
failed to deliver on a broad array of measures. The 104th Congress,
which will be elected this fall, in the next two years should:
<P>
Create a legislative process which permits up-or-down votes on
     important reforms;
<P>
Eliminate misleading budget procedures;
<P>
Fully apply all relevant federal laws to itself;
<P>
Eliminate congressional perks that are used to influence elections;
<P>
Pass campaign finance reform that gives a fair chance to challengers;
<P>
Rationalize the ineffective committee system by limiting memberships;
<P>
Eliminate party politics from internal congressional administration;
<P>
Pass truth-in-voting reforms to eliminate deceptive voting practices;
and
<P>
Limit congressional terms.
<P>
     Individual Members of Congress should make such reforms their top
legislative priority. Continued inaction will contribute to further
decline in public approval for -- and public legitimacy of --
Congress. The 103rd Congress gets poor marks on its reform record,
especially considering its tremendous initial promise. But like every
recipient of a poor report card, Congress can learn from it that there
is tremendous room for improvement.

<title>Time to Resolve the House Post Office Scandal -- Heritage</title>

<h3> TIME TO RESOLVE THE HOUSE POST OFFICE SCANDAL </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David M.  Mason</a><BR>
                    Director, U.S. Congress Assessment Project
<BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 375<br>
February 17, 1994<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 


     When the House of Representatives returns from its current break
on February 22, Members will decide how to resolve the House Post
Office scandal.
<P>
     Despite the conviction of seven former House employees for Post
Office-related crimes, and allegations of improper activity by sitting
Members of Congress, the House has failed to investigate the matter
properly or even to consider disciplinary action.  Representative
Ernest Istook (R-OK) has moved to force a vote next week ordering the
House Standards of Official Conduct Committee (the Ethics Committee)
to investigate the matter.
<P>
          The Post Office scandal began with a May 1991 investigation
by the U.S.  Capitol Police into embezzlement by a single employee. 
The inquiry rapidly expanded to include allegations against other
employees and a general audit of the Post Office.  In early June 1991
top House officials moved to stop the investigation despite protests
from then-Capitol Police Chief Frank Kerrigan.  A month later, the
Postal Inspection Service of the U.S.  Postal Service began its own
investigation at the request of then-U.S.  Attorney Jay Stevens.  In
September 1991, the report of that investigation was turned over to
House Postmaster Robert Rota, who says he gave the report to Heather
Foley, wife of House Speaker Thomas Foley and his unpaid chief-of-
staff.  No action was taken until January 1992 media reports revealed
that embezzlement and drug sales had taken place in the House Post
Office.  Following those reports, Democratic leaders referred the
matter to the House Administration Committee, which established an
investigative task force.
<P>
     The task force's investigation was marked by partisan disputes,
leading to the issuance of separate Republican and Democratic reports
in July 1992.  Democratic Task Force Leader Charles Rose of North
Carolina declared the matter closed, but the Republican report raised
numerous questions about illegal activity and mismanagement in the
Post Office, noting that many issues could not be resolved by the task
force because important records were unavailable and because Rota and
other Post Office employees were not questioned under oath.  Rota
subsequently admitted that he misled the task force.  The House agreed
to put the Post Office under the control of a new, non-partisan
administrator, but took no action to clarify questions raised by the
Republican task force report or to investigate and consider
disciplinary action against specific employees or Members, a step
which can be taken only by the Ethics Committee.
<P>
     The issue again subsided until July 1993, when former Postmaster
Rota pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, implicating House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and former
Representative Joe Kolter in an illegal scheme to trade stamps or
official House postal vouchers for cash.  Soon thereafter
Representative Istook began calling for an Ethics Committee
investigation of these allegations.  Largely on the argument that an
Ethics Committee investigation might interfere with the workings of an
ongoing grand jury inquiry, Istook agreed not to force a vote on his
request, but did introduce a resolution (H.Res.  238) calling for such
a probe.  The resolution has 60 cosponsors.
<P>
     Istook's request has now been pending for six months.  In the
meantime, authority for the first grand jury expired and a second
panel had to start work anew, this time under the third U.S.  Attorney
to supervise the case -- a Clinton appointee.  Istook argues that
further delay based on potential grand jury action is unwarranted, if
indeed it was ever justified.  As the House was preparing to leave for
a week-long recess on February 10, Istook gave notice that he would
demand a vote on his request for an Ethics Committee investigation as
soon as the House returns.  Since this is a matter of privilege under
House Rules, the Speaker must schedule the vote within two legislative
days, making it necessary for the House to consider the issue within a
day of its return on February 22.
<P>
     The Constitution gives the House the authority, and by
implication the responsibility, to discipline its members.  In other
cases House leaders have acted aggressively to preserve the
prerogatives of the House to discipline Members, rejecting attempts by
the executive branch or the judiciary.  This separation of powers
argument is a key justification, for instance, for congressional self-
exemptions from legal requirements or enforcement procedures under
many civil rights and worker protection laws.  Representative Rose,
who chaired the original Post Office investigation, claims that Ethics
Committee action regarding alleged deficiencies in his own financial
disclosure statements precludes subsequent court action on the same
charges.  The logic of these arguments would demand that the Justice
Department stand aside for an internal House probe of its Post Office,
rather than the other way around.  At a minimum it is clear that there
is no legal or constitutional requirement for the House to delay an
inquiry into the conduct of its own Members in anticipation of
potential action by the executive branch.
<P>
     House inaction on the Post Office compares unfavorably with the
Senate Ethics Committee's investigation of arguably lesser charges
against Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR).  Despite the Senate's aggressive
stance, the Justice Department apparently is conducting a parallel
investigation (an FBI agent recently examined Packwood's financial
disclosure filings).
<P>
     Istook has responded to charges that a House inquiry might
interfere with the Justice Department probe by requiring, in his
resolution, that the Ethics Committee cooperate with Justice and by
allowing the committee to suspend its inquiry with respect to any
Member who is already under investigation.  While media attention has
focused on allegations regarding Representative Rostenkowski, Istook's
resolution orders a broader inquiry which might determine whether
other Members violated House rules in connection with the Post Office. 
Such matters might well fall below the standard for criminal
prosecution, but still could warrant internal House action.
<P>
     Finally, Istook argues against the House simply awaiting
executive branch action, pointing out that the Reno Justice
Department's record in politically sensitive cases including
Whitewater, the death of Vincent Foster, and the State Department
personnel files (where Justice refused to prosecute, despite a
recommendation from the State Department's Inspector General),
inspires little confidence.  It was in anticipation of precisely this
sort of politically sensitive situation that the Constitution granted
Congressmen partial immunity from arrest and gave each House power to
discipline its own Members.  Abdicating that responsibility in such a
high profile case would again show that the House is incapable of
managing its internal affairs, and strengthen arguments for remedies
such as independent counsels and subjecting Members to executive
branch regulators.
<P>
     The House Post Office scandal has dragged on for three years. 
Despite the criminal convictions of several staff members, House
leaders have continued to resist a thorough investigation of
Representatives' conduct.  While caution to avoid interference with
criminal probes is appropriate, such external efforts are no excuse
for the House failing to deal with its internal scandal.  Istook's
motion for an Ethics Committee investigation will ensure that House
Members can no longer avoid this issue.

     If Congress is serious about reform -- cutting spending, staff,
and the undergrowth of overlapping committees -- there is no better
place to start than by eliminating "select committees."  Organized
around hot-button issues, these panels have large budgets and staff,
but lack authority to pass legislation to solve the problems they
examine.  Tomorrow the House is scheduled to consider H.  Res.  52,
which would provide funding for the four existing House select
committees to operate for an additional year.  Last Tuesday, January
26, the House on a 237-180 vote defeated a resolution to reauthorize
one of the select committees (on narcotics) for two years.  Startled
House leaders pulled resolutions on the other three committee from the
House schedule.  H.  Res.  52 is a compromise proposal designed to
keep the select committees alive until the Joint Committee on the
Organization of the Congress reports broader reform proposals.  But
the reform study should not be used as an excuse to delay needed
reforms, and there are convincing arguments to abolish the select
committees now.
<P>
     Eliminating select committees will advance the important reform
objectives of emphasizing the legislative mission of Congress, cutting
staff, eliminating overlapping committees, reducing spending, curbing
special interest influence, and limiting incumbents' electoral
advantages.  These goals are elements of The Heritage Foundation's
congressional reform program, and are included in many other reform
proposals.
<P>
     Focusing Congress on Legislating. Traditionally, select
committees are formed for a limited time and a specific purpose: 
panels to investigate Iran-Contra and October Surprise allegations and
the joint reform committee are recent examples.  In the mid-1970s,
however, the House began creating bodies with vague mandates to look
into broader social problems, resulting in the existing four select
committees on Aging, Narcotics, Hunger, and Children, Youth and
Families.  Rather than forming definite plans for action in these
areas, the committees have sought renewed authority every other year
(the House can only authorize the committees for the two-year length
of a Congress) for as long as eighteen years now.  Because select
committees cannot consider legislation they cannot, by definition,
take steps to address the problems they investigate.  The lack of real
purpose has caused the committees to drift beyond their mandates, with
the Aging Committee, for instance, involving itself in health care for
all ages, the environment, and even programs for farm workers.
<P>
     Getting Congress to concentrate on its central, legislative
mission is the key to effective reform.  Eliminating select committees
would remove a needless distraction and encourage Congress to focus
its energies on legislative solutions to pressing problems.
<P>
     Reducing the Budget and Staff. There is a broad consensus on the
need to reduce congressional spending and staff.  President Clinton
has called for a 25 percent staff cut.  The select committees employ
91 staffers; their combined budgets total $3.65 million.  Eliminating
select committees would trim House committee staffs by 4.5 percent. 
This represents a useful first step toward President Clinton's 25
percent target, and would allow the House to concentrate staff in more
important areas, even as it reduces overall numbers.
<P>
     Eliminating Overlapping Committees.  Reformers agree that
Congress has too many committees, often with overlapping
responsibilities.  Multiple assignments make it difficult for Members
of Congress to attend properly to committee business, and
jurisdictional conflicts make passing legislation difficult.  The
select committees themselves attempt to justify their existence by
citing the large numbers of regular (standing) committees that have
responsibility in their area of concern:  eight of 22 standing House
committees in the case of the Hunger panel.  But addressing
overlapping committee jurisdictions by creating yet another committee
is like trying to cure a hangover with Scotch.  If committees are not
organized appropriately to address major national problems, overall
committee jurisdictions should be reformed.  The select committees
have a total of 172 members, so their elimination would be a major
step forward in reducing scheduling conflicts and dissipation of
Member and staff efforts.
<P>
     The Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress is
examining the committee structure in hopes of reducing the number of
committees and subcommittees and rationalizing jurisdictional
divisions.  Eliminating select committees now would aid the reform
process by removing one issue from the joint committee's overburdened
platter.  Reauthorizing the select committees for a year in hopes of a
reprieve would send a very damaging signal that Congress intends to
use the joint committee to construct a facade of reform while
attempting to continue business as usual.
<P>
     Curbing Electioneering and Special Interests. Because the select
committees have no authority to consider legislation or otherwise
change programs or policies, they have become publicity and lobbying
organizations, often allied with special interest groups which benefit
from the programs the committees push.  A large budget item for most
select committees is for "field hearings."  Even more than most
congressional hearings, these travelling shows are more about
publicity than about legislation.  Members of the committees visit
sites outside of Washington supposedly to hear from ordinary citizens. 
But the real objective is for constituents to hear from their
Congressman:  almost all field hearings are in districts represented
by members of the select committee.  The shows dominate local media
while they are in town.  So appealing is this posturing that the
select committees have swollen to become among the largest in
Congress.  The Aging Committee, with 69 members, is larger by far than
any of the House's standing committees.  But since the committees
cannot approve legislation, they are guaranteed to do nothing about
the citizens' concerns.  As such, they represent, at best, hollow
expressions of concern and can be of no real assistance to those in
need.
<P>
     Reform Now. The House has an opportunity tomorrow to demonstrate
a commitment to real congressional reform.  The House should follow
through on its decision last week to eliminate the Narcotics Committee
by voting this week to eliminate all four select committees.  Allowing
the congressional leadership to keep these panels alive for another
year by approving H.  Res.  52 would represent a big step backward for
congressional reform.

<h3> WHY YOU WERE RIGHT IN CALLING FOR A LINE-ITEM VETO </h3>
By Steven Schwalm<BR>

Memo to President-elect Clinton #11<BR>
January 18, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<p>
I strongly support the line-item veto, because I think it's
one of the most powerful weapons we could use in our fight
against out-of-control deficit spending.
<P>

Bill Clinton, quoted in "Just Do It," The Wall Street Journal
Editorial, February 26, 1992.<P>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<P>Throughout the campaign, President-elect Clinton, you called on
Congress to give the President a line-item veto, characterizing
yourself as "strongly in favor" of the power. (Associated Press wire
service stories, April 29, June 8, and June 21, 1992.) An item veto
unquestionably would aid efforts to reduce wasteful spending and cut
the deficit. Using "impoundments" (an authority, since revoked, to
refuse to spend appropriated funds) Lyndon Johnson was able to cut 6.7
percent of total federal spending in 1967. That percentage today would
amount to $98.8 billion, or nearly one-third of the federal deficit
for 1993. Your commitment to "reinventing government" offers another
compelling argument for a presidential item veto. Previous
presidentially sponsored government reform efforts frequently have
been frustrated by congressional amendments to spending bills and
other "must pass" legislation. Pressing for an item veto in the face
of congressional opposition will provide an early test of your
determination to reform government and control spending.
<P>Within days of your election victory, Democratic congressional
leaders were openly opposing your call for an item veto. (Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, "Face the Nation," November 8, 1992.)
Yet Congress's profligate, pork barrel spending and its practice of
stuffing hundreds of provisions into omnibus, "must sign" bills
provide the best arguments for a line-item veto. House Speaker Tom
Foley has proposed a compromise, known as "enhanced rescission," which
would allow the President to propose spending cuts subject to a simple
majority vote in Congress. While enhanced rescission would be a step
in the right direction, partially restoring presidential impoundment
authority lost twenty years ago, it is not an acceptable substitute
for a full-fledged line-item veto. Rescissions are easier to defeat
than vetoes (requiring a 50 percent rather than a two-thirds
majority), they apply only to spending figures in appropriations bills
(excluding the vast majority of legislation passed), and Congress
could avoid tough votes by changing rescission ground rules. Only a
genuine line-item veto will give you the tools necessary to reduce
wasteful spending and to defend against inappropriate congressional
meddling in the management of the executive branch. 

<P>To fulfil your commitment to the line-item veto, you should take
the following actions beginning immediately:
<P>Action 1: Strongly restate your desire for a line-item veto in your
    inaugural address.
<P>Action 2: Create a task force including key members of your economic
    and legislative teams to secure adoption of a line-item
    veto constitutional amendment.
<P>
Action 3: Include a line-item veto amendment in your legislative
    package for enactment in the first 100 days of your
    Administration.
<P>
Action 4: Continue discussions with congressional leaders on enhanced
    rescission, but only as an interim step toward a
    constitutional line-item veto.
<P>
Action 5: Refuse to sign a debt limit extension unless coupled with a
    package of budget reforms, including the line-item veto.
    (See Scott A.  Hodge, "How to Get Spending Under Control,"
    Heritage Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton, No. 
    8, January 15, 1993 and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "An Action
    Plan to Create Jobs," Heritage Foundation Memo to
    President-Elect Clinton, No.  1, December 14, 1992.)
<P>
THE NEED FOR REFORM
<P>Governors in 43 states have a line-item veto, as you did as
Governor of Arkansas. Of present and former governors who responded to
a recent survey, 93 percent describe the item veto as a useful tool
for balancing the budget. Some 92 percent of the state executives
believe that a line-item veto would help the President restrain
federal spending. ("How Governors Think Congress Should Reform the
Budget:  Results of a Survey of U.S.  Governors and Former Governors,"
Cato Institute Policy Analysis, December 9, 1992.) An item veto works
to limit spending because executive officials, representing broader
constituencies, are often willing to oppose special interest spending
inserted in legislation by powerful lawmakers or narrow coalitions.
Even when it is not used, the threat of an item veto can increase the
executive's negotiating leverage with the legislature.

<P>While the federal Constitution does not include a line-item
veto, Presidents traditionally were recognized as possessing an
inherent power to "impound" or refuse to spend unneeded funds.
Impoundments were not even subject to congressional votes or approval.
That power was stripped by Title X of the Budget Act of 1974. This and
other reforms in the 1974 Act, many of which reduced presidential
budgetary powers, were coincident with, and arguably caused, the
emergence of the permanent, structural federal deficit. The total
deficit was only $6 billion in 1974. The smallest deficit since was
$40 billion in 1979. (Historical Tables, Budget of the United States
Government.  Figures in nominal dollars.)

<P>That the budget process needs reform seems beyond argument, and
there is a remarkable consensus among the public, governors, and both
parties' presidential candidates in favor of the line-item veto as one
element of reform. Only among Congress's Democratic leaders is there
implacable, and apparently self-interested opposition to a line-item
veto. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell spoke out against the
line-item veto just days after the election, and declared himself only
"less opposed" to Speaker Foley's compromise proposal of enhanced
rescission. ( Transcripts of CBS's "Face the Nation," November 8,
1992.) Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd has
vowed emphatically that he is "opposed to any legislation that would
diminish the Congress's Constitutional role with respect to the powers
of the purse." (Eric Pianin, "Byrd Opposes Line-Item Veto Proposal,"
The Washington Post, November 18, 1992.) Even Vice President-elect Al
Gore voted against every line-item veto proposal before the Senate
during his tenure, a total of six votes between 1985 and 1992. (
Senate record vote numbers:  156, 157, 158, 99th Congress, First
Session, June 18, 1985; vote #294, 101st Congress, First Session,
November 9, 1989; vote #111, 101st Congress, Second Session, July 6,
1990; vote #33, 102nd Congress, Second Session, February 27, 1992.)
The Vice President-elect also voted against an enhanced rescission
proposal similar to that now being put forward to Speaker Foley. (

September 19, 1986.)
<P>
HOUSING AND URBAN PORK
<P>The story of pork-barrel politicking and management interference
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers one of
the clearest case studies of the need for a line-item veto. You have
spoken highly, Mr. Clinton, of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's approach to
better meeting housing and other urban needs. While Kemp's ideas
received too little support within the Bush Administration, it was
Congress which directly opposed and frustrated most of Kemp's
proposals.

<P>In 1989, Congress investigated allegations of influence-peddling
involving the distribution of non-competitive grants by former
Secretary Samuel Pierce and other HUD officials. Some officials were
criminally prosecuted, and an Independent Counsel investigation of the
scandal continues. Many of the questionable grants were made through
the "Secretary's Discretionary Fund," so incoming Secretary Kemp moved
to abolish the fund and end discretionary grants throughout the
Department, making all awards on a competitive basis.

<P>Rather than agreeing to Kemp's reforms, Congress assumed control
of the scandal-ridden fund and began making grants of its own. Now
known as the "Special Purpose Grants" fund, it is exclusively at the
disposal of Members of Congress. Grants from this fund are distributed
not on the basis of demonstrated need, likely effectiveness, or other
objective standards, but according to the power and political
preferences of members on the committees that fund HUD. Since Congress
seized it in 1989, the fund has grown from $10 million to $260 million
for fiscal year 1993, ( HUD summaries of Appropriation Conference
Reports, FY 1989-93.  All budget figures are in nominal dollars unless
otherwise noted.) a 2,600 percent increase in politically tainted
pork. 

<P>Kemp called it "disgraceful for politically influential
lawmakers to insist on earmarking funds for pet projects when [he had]
been trying to rid the department of favoritism and scandals.... " (
"Kemp Lashes Out at Hill's Projects, Secretary Vows to Fight
'Disgraceful' Earmarking of HUD Funds," The Washington Post, November
27, 1989.) It is doubly disgraceful to do so after prosecuting HUD
officials for doing exactly the same thing. The real scandal at HUD is
not the former officials who are being investigated and prosecuted,
but the fact that Congress acts in precisely the same manner legally
as a matter of course.

<P>Following are a few examples from the 1993 special purpose
grants fund: (For a complete listing, see House Report 102-902
(Conference Report on VA/HUD Appropriations), Amendment No.  83, pp. 
21-31.)
<P>$3 million, in part for design and planning for a western
   frontier-Oregon Territory historical center;

<P>$2.5 million for "infrastructure demolition and repair" in
   wealthy Marin County, California;

<P>$1.2 million for "continued infrastructure development" in the
   "Hawaiian Home Lands" and $1.3 million in continued assistance
   for two sugarcane mills (These have been ongoing annual HUD
   handouts);

<P>$1 million for "neighborhood improvement in the Hilltop section
   of Davenport Iowa";

<P>$2.2 million for single room occupancy housing in Portland,
   Oregon ($25,000 per room);

<P>$1.5 million to renovate each of two country courthouses in
   Alabama;

<P>$1 million each to restore two theaters in Georgia;

<P>$250,000 for a water tower at an industrial park in Joplin,
   Missouri;

<P>$1.9 to the vacation haven of Mackinac Island, Michigan, "to
   restore historic buildings and for other municipal purposes";

<P>$1.5 million for a visitor center in western New Mexico.

<P>The list goes on and on, Mr. Clinton, for a dozen pages --
hundreds of grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Some may
even go for worthy projects. There is really no way for the average
taxpayer to know. In one instance, an application for funding under a
$1 million report grant labeled "Housing and other purposes" was made
for tennis courts in an upscale area. (The grant was ultimately
refused by the Federal Housing Commissioner. ( Account of the former
Executive Assistant to the Federal Housing Commissioner.))

<P>There appears to be no rational basis for funding a water tower
for one industrial park, or revitalization efforts for one downtown
area absent a broader, national program for industrial or commercial
development. There is, however, an obvious explanation for why these
projects were favored over others: all of the projects listed above
and the vast majority of special purpose grant projects are in
districts or states represented by members of the appropriations
subcommittees which fund HUD or of the parent committees. For
instance, California receives the largest share of special purpose
grants funding, $25.2 million -- not surprising, as it is the largest
state. The second largest share of funding, however, $19.25 million,
went to tiny West Virginia, home of House HUD subcommittee member Alan
Mollohan, and of line-item veto foe and Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd. In comparison, Arkansas, a slightly
larger state with similar economic development needs received only
$1.25 million. Toledo, represented by House HUD subcommittee member
Marcie Kaptur, received $3.5 million in grants while nearby and much
larger Detroit got only $2.9 million. Cleveland, home of senior
subcommittee member Louis Stokes is targeted for $8.5 million in
funding, far more than the larger cities of Chicago and Philadelphia.
<P>
REINVENTING GOVERNMENT -- IF YOU CAN
<P>While the irrationality and waste of distributing federal funds
in this fashion presents a compelling case for the item veto, the way
in which Congress treats executive branch policy proposals presents an
even stronger argument. Within the 1993 HUD funding bill, for
instance, are no fewer than 137 specific policy instructions,
frequently referred to as "riders," having to do with the
administration and management of HUD and other agencies. Many appear
to be so reasonable as to be unnecessary and certainly
unobjectionable. Others, however, are quite obviously petty and
counterproductive. Dozens unilaterally alter contract terms or cancel
debts owed to the federal government. In two separate places, the bill
mandates that the "Office of Lead-based Paint Abatement" be located in
the office of the Secretary and staffed and funded at a designated
level. While lead poisoning is a serious problem, having a
congressional subcommittee designate the location and staffing of a
HUD office, apparently in opposition to the judgment of HUD experts,
is hardly the best way of addressing it.

<P>Saying who gets which office is just the tip of the iceberg. Far
more important to Kemp's efforts at HUD than eliminating specific
questionable grants was an overall management reform that would allow
the department to serve the needy better and more efficiently. Largely
through restrictions in earlier appropriations bills, Congress stymied
Kemp at every pass. First, Congress divided HUD into seven components
for funding purposes, specifying spending and employment levels for
each. As a result Kemp was stopped from any significant reorganization
of his department. More alarmingly, the appropriations subcommittee
stopped Kemp from establishing a department-wide database which would
have improved financial management and reduced opportunities for
fraud. Congress also prohibited Kemp from moving employees, even
temporarily, into an organization intended to help clean up the
management mess he inherited. ( See Chapter Four in The Heritage
Foundation's book, The Ruling Class by Eric Felten (Washington, D.C.: 
Regnery Gateway, 1993).)

<P>So, faced with the task of reversing criminal mismanagement, low
morale, and inefficiency, Congress told Kemp he could not reorganize
his department, he could not computerize his records, and he could not
assemble a team of agency employees to improve departmental
management. Unfortunately, Congress is likely to be no less willing to
block Clinton Administration reorganization efforts than it has been
to oppose the line-item veto proposal. A President lacking a line-item
veto who objects to a few of the hundreds of management and statutory
restrictions routinely included in appropriations bills has the
choice, in the case of HUD, of holding up funding for the entire
Veterans Administration, NASA, HUD, and several other agencies, or
swallowing hard and accepting the restrictions. This process will be
crippling to any effort to reinvent government by reforming operations
and changing employee incentives. Please note, Mr. President-elect,
that no version of enhanced rescission authority would allow you to
challenge a single one of these hundreds of policy and management
restrictions.
<P>
MORE PORK AND MORE MICROMANAGEMENT AT DEFENSE

<P>Pork-laden appropriations bills, unfortunately, are the rule
rather than the exception. The Department of Defense (DoD)
appropriations contains hundreds of millions worth of pork-barrel line
items, including:

<P>$100 million for a fisheries grant program;
 <BR>$7 million to clean up "the National Presto Industries Eau
   Claire Facility";
<BR>$10 million for a "National Guard Outreach Program in the Los
   Angeles Schools District";
<BR>$5 million for electric vehicle projects in Hawaii and
   Sacramento, California;
<BR>A laundry list of 21 grants to specified universities in amounts
   ranging from $500,000 to $15 million;
<BR>Report instructions to retain indefinitely the same number of
   podiatrists as were on active duty in 1990, despite significant
   cuts in overall personnel levels.

<P>Also like HUD, Congress uses the "must sign" appropriations bill
as an opportunity to force hundreds of programmatic, management, and
statutory instructions -- 244 in the case of the 1993 appropriation --
essentially unrelated to funding levels on the Defense Department.
Secretary-designate Les Aspin's most serious obstacle in reforming the
department will be his former colleagues on Capitol Hill. Without a
line-item veto, the hundreds of strings represented by these
appropriations "riders" will be woven into a straightjacket for
departmental management. 

<P>Congress was not always so active in dictating executive branch
management decisions. Most of those 244 defense dictates were
contained in 168 "general provisions" appended to the appropriation.
There were only 64 such instructions in 1970. Requirements for DoD
reports to Congress, another method of congressional control, grew
even more dramatically, from only 36 in 1970 to 861 in 1990, an
increase of 2,400 percent. ("White Paper on the Department of Defense
and the Congress," Report to the President by the Secretary of
Defense, January 1990.) Secretary Dick Cheney dramatically presented
mountainous piles of these reports, calling for a reduction early in
his tenure to little avail. 
<P>
Shouldn't Congress Have Its Way?
 
<P>Opponents of the line-item veto, and of enhanced rescission,
cite the congressional power of the purse. The problem with this
argument is that many troublesome pork and micromanagement provisions
would not survive open votes in the House and Senate as part of the
actual legislation. In order to enhance their power to make funding
and management decisions, congressional committees have come up with
procedures to either avoid open debate or to skirt the legislative
process in an extra-constitutional fashion.

<P>To circumvent obstacles inherent in the legislative process,
such as recorded votes, Congress often includes pork "earmarks" in
committee or conference reports. Reports are documents intended to
explain legislation and give guidance in carrying out provisions of
the law. These reports are written by staffers, often unsupervised by
elected representatives. Furthermore, they cannot be voted on or
amended by the full House or Senate. Congress insists, however, that
executive agencies give these reports the force of law, going so far
as to instruct agencies to comply with the reports through provisions
in the actual appropriations legislation.

<P>Another opportunity for unaccountable and unreviewable
legislation occurs in the conference committees which meet to iron out
differences between House and Senate versions of a bill. Only a few
Members, drawn almost exclusively from the committees that originated
the legislation, are appointed as conferees. In practice the members
of a conference committee have wide latitude to change the legislation
as they see fit, and they frequently make significant, politically
sensitive changes in legislation or add pork. Some of those changes
amount to congressional voting fraud, by removing nearly identical
provisions approved by both houses of Congress. Because the conference
takes place after the legislation is through the amending process, and
takes place in closed meetings rather than on the House and Senate
floors, all manner of objectionable provisions can be added in secret,
without votes. And when the conferees are finished, there is rarely
enough time to review the often massive bills before they are voted on
a final time. The conferees' staff then put together yet another
"report," adding additional pork and micromanagerial instructions for
the executive branch. (See the "Sleight of Hand" and "Legislating
Backwards" chapters of The Heritage Foundation's book, The Ruling
Class by Eric Felten (Washington, D.C.:  Regnery Gateway, 1993).) 

<P>This entire process, and the committee and conference reports in
particular, amount to the enactment of laws outside the constitutional
legislative process. It is the congressional insistence on
shortcutting constitutional and democratic principles, often cloaked
in a claim of congressional prerogatives, that makes an alteration in
constitutional arrangements, such as the line-item veto, essential.
The President needs a line-item veto to combat Congress's extra-
constitutional power grabs.
<P>
ENHANCED RESCISSION: IT WON'T CUT IT

<P>The enhanced rescission proposal that Speaker Foley has offered
as a compromise has several weaknesses and loopholes that make it
unacceptable as a substitute for a genuine line-item veto. Most
notably, a simple majority of either House of Congress could defeat a
rescission, as opposed to a two-thirds majority in both houses
required to override a veto. (In comparison, Congress did not have a
say at all in impoundment decisions prior to 1974.) The Foley proposal
is apparently based on H.R. 2164, which was introduced in the last
Congress by Democratic Representative Tom Carper (now Governor of
Delaware), and which passed the House on a 312-97 vote on October 3,
1992. That bill would have allowed the President to send a rescission
proposal to Congress within three days of enactment of an
appropriation act. Special procedures seek to guarantee a rapid vote
on the President's proposal without amendments.

<P>President Bush's experience with a similar provision already
included in the 1974 budget act may be instructive. In April 1992 Bush
sent four separate rescission packages to Congress under a procedure
which purportedly allowed a straight up or down vote on each proposal.
Instead the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported
packages combining the separate rescission proposals, accepting some
of the President's cuts, and replacing others with congressional
preferences. The House concocted its own version of the President's
original proposals, somewhat different than what the President
actually sent, claiming that allowing a vote on the one combined
package met the requirement for separate consideration of the four
presidential proposals. The Senate Appropriations Committee simply
reported the President's proposals to the floor and then ignored them
in preference to its own combined package.

<P>More revealing than the procedural shenanigans were the comments
of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Byrd in reaction to the
President's exercise of powers that Congress had explicitly granted.
"It might be the better part of wisdom not to push this thing," Byrd
noted, warning that "the farther down the road it gets the meaner it's
going to get. And its not going to do the president any good, and its
not going to do this institution any good." (Quoted in Congressional
Quarterly, "Congress Tries to Outdo Bush in Anti-Pork Campaign," by
George Hager, May 2, 1992, pp.  1148-1150.)

<P>While H.R. 2164 had several provisions which seek to prevent the
type of procedural gamesmanship which surrounded the Bush request,
those provisions are applied only as part of House and Senate rules.
Those rules can be changed by the House or Senate alone at any time,
and despite disclaimers to the contrary, they can also be ignored or
temporarily overridden at any time. Even if Congress felt compelled to
play by the rules it had set, it might effectively amend a President's
rescission package by reporting a similar but separate bill, defeating
the President's proposal and passing its own alternative.

<P>Even absent procedural curveballs, the proposed enhanced
rescission authority is very limited. It applies only to spending
amounts in appropriations bills. Changes in entitlement or tax law,
conceivably costing billions, would be off limits, as would pork
provisions in authorizing legislation. The President could offer only
one package, lumping together separate objections in one bill, and
that only immediately after the bill is signed. In this respect
enhanced rescission is far weaker than the impoundment authority which
was stripped from the President in 1974: under it, cuts could be made
separately and at any point during a fiscal year, when it might become
evident that funding initially approved was unnecessary.

<P>The greatest deficiency of the enhanced rescission approach is
that it does not reach the critical policy and managerial provisions
in appropriations bills, much less in other legislation. For an
Administration in which reforming government may be as critical as,
and even a precondition to, cutting spending, this failure is
critical. While an enhanced rescission proposal would be a step in the
right direction for spending control, it is no substitute for a line-
item veto.
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P>Mr. Clinton, your support for a presidential line-item veto was
an important element of your appeal as a fiscally responsible New
Democrat. Securing that power in office is even more critical to your
success in reducing deficit spending, and to reforming operations of
the executive branch. As long as Congress is second-guessing the
smallest decisions of your appointees, your attempt at "putting people
first" will be reduced to bureaucratic business as usual in short
order. Despite opposition among key Democrats in Congress, you must
persist in your commitment to a line-item veto. Aside from the
intrinsic merits, standing up to Washington insiders will be an
outstanding public demonstration of your determination to break with
the special interest politics of the past. While the ratification
process for a constitutional amendment would delay implementation of
the line-item veto power, the ratification process would provide a
marvelous opportunity for your Administration to take its case for
reform to the American public.

<P>Your opportunity to push this reform is now. The longer you
wait, the freer Congress will feel to resist your proposals. In
addition, several specific requirements of the budget calendar provide
irreplaceable opportunities to push a line-item veto this spring.
Securing a line-item veto will require a vigorous action plan
beginning on Inauguration Day. Key elements of this plan should
include: 
<P>
Action 1:   Strongly restate your desire for a line-item veto in
      your inaugural address. 
<P>
   Lack of a firm response in the face of outspoken congressional
opposition could lead to a public peception that you are abandoning
campaign commitments under pressure from Washington insiders.
<P>
Action 2:   Create a line-iem veto task force composed of key
      members of your economic and legislative affairs teams
      to come up with an action plan for congressional
      approval of a line-item veto constitutional amendment
      within the first 100 days of the Administration. 

<P>Creation of a specific task force is critical, as you must
communicate to your own economic and legislative advisors, many of
whom are from Washington, the importance of the line-item veto in your
efforts to control deficit spending, reinvent government, and keep
your commitments to the American people. Resistance or tepid support
from within your own Administration will be as damaging to your
efforts to secure a line-item veto as congressional opposition.
<P>
Action 3: Include a line-item veto constitutional amendment in the
    legislative program submitted to Congress for enactment
    during the first 100 days of your Administration.

<P>Failure to push the proposal immediately will allow public
support to dissipate and allow opponents to organize opposition.
<P>
Action 4: Continue discussions with congressional leaders on enhanced
    rescission authority only as an interim measure which may
    be useful during the amendment ratification process.

<P>In order to restrain government spending most effectively and to
protect your ability to reform and reorganize the government, a
constitutional amendment providing a line-item veto for all
legislation is essential. Enhanced rescission measures, limited to
appropriation figures only, exclude entitlements and (in most cases)
tax measures, which are key to deficit reduction. Neither would
enhanced rescission allow you to address the hundreds of policy and
management restrictions routinely added to appropriations and other
legislation.
<P>
Action 5: Propose a package of budget reforms, including the line-
    item veto, to be enacted as a part of the debt limit
    extension that must be enacted in March.

<P>You should announce publicly that you will not sign a debt-limit
extension made necessary by decisions of previous Administrations and
Congresses unless the extension is accompanied by acceptable budget
reforms. Promises for votes on reforms at a later date are
unacceptable. Both versions of Gramm-Rudman were enacted as a part of
debt limit increases. Forwarding your own package will head off
inevitable congressional demands to again revise budget procedures.)

<P>During the campaign, you declared "I'm a Democrat who believes
in the line-item veto and believes in cutting out wasteful government
spending." Members of Congress have promised real reforms. Now you and
Congress have an opportunity to make good on reform promises with
enactment of a line-item veto.

<h3>One Simple Way to Reduce AIDS Among Children</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick F. Fagan</a><br>
Wiliam H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues<br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 446<br>
February 13, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government can and should take appropriate 
action to protect public health. One way Congress can do this is by introducing AIDS 
testing for newborns, making the results known to mothers and their doctors. A House-
Senate conference on the Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) 
presents Members of Congress with an opportunity to introduce this change and so 
protect at-risk children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Testing mothers and their babies for AIDS and 
communicating the results to the mother and her attending physician is not routine. It is a 
major deviation from standard medical practice in the case of many other contagious 
diseases which may threaten the life or health of the newborn. Today, for example, most 
states require that newborn babies be tested for a variety of diseases, including syphilis, 
and that the results be communicated to the mother and her attending physician. The 
Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act, which is now in a House/Senate conference, could 
save the lives of hundreds of babies each year by requiring an AIDS test. It could also 
save the country hundreds of millions of dollars needed to treat children with AIDS 
whose condition could have been detected at birth and treated more effectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two sharply different policies are before the conference 
committee on the Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act. The first, supported by Senator 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), continues current policy by encouraging voluntary testing and 
mandating the counseling of all pregnant women in states designated as having the 
highest incidence of the HIV virus. The second, supported by Representatives Gary 
Ackerman (D-NY) and Tom Coburn (R-OK), requires that newborns whose mothers' 
AIDS status is unknown be tested as a condition for receiving funds under the Act. Thus, 
every child would have to be tested for HIV if the mother had not been tested, and the 
state would communicate the results to the mother and attending physician. The 
Ackerman-Coburn provision is not an unfunded mandate, however, since the money for 
testing would be included in the appropriated federal funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the Senate version values the "privacy" of the 
mother, the House version wisely values the lives of the babies while upholding 
confidentiality -- which already is standard medical practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Ackerman-Coburn policy would result in saved 
lives and reduced costs. Medical researchers say that AZT treatment of a mother with 
AIDS during pregnancy and labor, and of the baby for a period after birth, reduces the 
incidence of AIDS in these babies by about 65 percent. Today, about 25 percent of babies 
born to such mothers eventually succumb to full-blown HIV infection and die in their 
early years. With AZT treatment, this death rate is reduced to about 8 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such a policy saves many lives while also cutting the 
cost of treatment. Treating HIV-infected (and dying) babies costs about $240 million 
annually. Treating at-risk babies in the womb and immediately after birth with AZT 
would cost about $12 million, leaving more money for research, better public health, and 
other essential purposes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today's voluntary testing policy simply means that some 
mothers, however unwittingly, may be endangering their babies' lives. Many babies 
infected with the HIV virus, for example, go home with their mothers not knowing they 
are infected. Worse, uninfected babies born to mothers ignorant of their own infection can 
contract the disease from their mothers' milk. Furthermore, immunizing a baby with the 
AIDS virus against various diseases in the standard fashion can weaken rather than 
strengthen the child's health. Any such child who gets an infection as a byproduct of the 
immunization is at much greater risk of a serious breakdown in health than is a normal 
baby. For all of these children, the knowledge that they are HIV positive would alter the 
course of medical treatment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because of the continuing social stigma attached to 
AIDS, many policymakers oppose mandatory reporting of the infection to public health 
authorities, as well as any requirement that either the carrier of the disease or others who 
may have been infected by the carrier be identified. But this ignores the public health 
aspects of this contagious disease. Moreover, whatever case might be made for 
maintaining today's policy for adults, it does not exist for newborns. According to the 
only survey of pregnant mothers on this subject, conducted by New York City's Bellevue 
Hospital, no mother reported that she would avoid prenatal care if there was mandatory 
testing. The frustration for doctors is that 25 percent of mothers at risk for AIDS do not 
avail themselves of voluntary testing. Since 1988, in New York State alone, an estimated 
12,000 babies have not been treated properly because of a lack of mandatory testing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Approximately 7,000 mothers who are HIV positive, and 
will eventually succumb to AIDS, give birth each year. Of these births, approximately 
1,800 babies (25 percent) will be born with HIV antibodies present in their system. A 
further 14 percent of those born uninfected to these mothers will become HIV positive 
from their mothers' milk. Over 50 percent of the babies with HIV antibodies (around 900 
annually) are not known by their physician or mother to be infected at birth. Of these, 
about 25 percent (approximately 200) die annually. With proper medical treatment, this 
number can be reduced to about 8 percent, or around 70 deaths per year. Under current 
policy, however, the number of undiagnosed, untreated, needlessly dying babies will 
continue to grow as AIDS continues to spread.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many public officials and health professionals want a 
change in policy. For example, the Centers for Disease Control's own subcommittee on 
infant testing (a subcommittee of the review committee on prenatal testing and 
counseling guidelines), recommended the approach taken by Representatives Ackerman 
and Coburn. New York Governor George Pataki calls the Senate version "unfortunate" 
and strongly supports the Ackerman-Coburn policy. New York has the largest number of 
AIDS-infected babies in the country. And Dr. James Coplan, a member of the 
Department of Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the State University of New 
York Health Sciences Center at Syracuse, says that "As AIDS spreads to [suburban 
populations] HIV infections in pregnant women or newborn infants is likely to become 
progressively harder to detect, unless universal screening is adopted."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act presents 
Members of Congress with a clear choice. They can support a new policy grounded in 
standard medical practice and save hundreds of babies' lives. Or they can continue a 
policy that leads to unnecessary deaths of newborn babies exposed to AIDS.

<title>Lessons on Reforming Health Care at the State Level -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 548</b><br>
<h3>Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and 
Educational Programs</a></h3>

<h2>Lessons on Reforming Health Care At the State Level: 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, And Washington State</h2> 
A Physicians Council Symposium<br>
June 13, 1995<br>


<a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">DR. ROBERT E. MOFFIT</a>, Deputy Director of 
Domestic Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation: With last year's collapse of President Clinton's 
huge health plan, we have seen throughout the country a growth in policy experimentation at the 
state level. But the striking feature about most of these state-based reforms is that, in many 
instances -- such as Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Kentucky -- the health care reform 
proposals resemble, in crucial respects, the discredited Clinton health care plan.
Like the Clinton plan, these systems concentrate key decisionmaking power in the hands of 
government officials. The health care system is to be governed by a central board or commission 
that issues rules and regulations and guidelines for the system. Almost all of them have a 
comprehensive, government-standardized benefits package specifying in some detail the treatments 
or procedures that must be available to citizens. Most establish government-sponsored health care 
cooperatives, or regional alliances at the state levels, or managed care networks. Most include 
employer mandates and a system of price controls.
<p>
But state reformers have painfully discovered that, in many respects, reform at the state level is 
subject to the same explosive politics as reform at the national level. The politics of health care 
reform is like the politics of a Rubik's cube. It is an excruciating exercise in frustration: You fix one 
thing only to find that you are breaking another.
<p>
Talking about reform of health care at the state level, we have three distinguished panelists.
<p>
<a href="#mass">Charles Baker</a> comes to us from the state of Massachusetts. He was 
appointed Secretary of Administration and Finance by Governor William Weld in November of 
1994. Mr. Baker directs the preparation of the Governor's budget proposals in Massachusetts and 
serves as the Governor's chief advisor on fiscal matters. Prior to assuming that role, he was 
Undersecretary of Health in the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. As 
Undersecretary, he managed six health agencies and was responsible for the reform of the hospital 
finance system.
<p>
The second of our panelists is <a href="#minn">Dr. Ken Heithoff</a>. Dr. Heithoff is Chairman 
of the CDI Management Corporation and Medical Director of the Center for Diagnostic Imaging in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, a physician-owned company. He is a member of the Hammond County 
Medical Society, the Minnesota Medical Association, and the American College of Radiology. 
Very active in market-based health care reform in Minnesota, he served as an advisor to 
Congressman Jim Ramstad and Senator Rod Grams, the new Senator for Minnesota. Dr. Heithoff is 
the Chairman of the Minnesota Independent Republican Health Care Task Force, which has been 
meeting regularly since April of 1994.
<p>
<a href="#wash">Phil Dyer</a> is the state representative of the fifth district in Washington 
State. Representative Dyer serves on the Health Care Committee of the Washington State House. 
He has a B.S. from Oregon State University. He also is a graduate of the Army Corps of Engineers, 
serving as a member of the Command General Staff College. Representative Dyer received a public 
service award from the National Federation of Independent Business. He was the leading opponent 
of Washington State's Clinton-style health care plan.
<p>
<a name="mass"></a>
<b>MASSACHUSETTS</b>
<p>
CHARLES BAKER: The most important thing about state-level health care reform is to remember 
the old Clint Eastwood saying about knowing your limitations. I agree with The Heritage 
Foundation and with Dr. Kevin Vigilante and others that the major genetic error in the current 
structure of the existing health care system is the federal tax code. And because that's the major, 
fundamental structural problem, it has created a corporate relationship between health plans and 
provider systems as opposed to an individual relationship between patients and doctors.
<p>
Therefore, I was never that interested, at the state level, in pursuing anything as broad and as 
comprehensive as Minnesota Care, or Tenn Care, or Washington State Care, or whatever else you 
call them. But we did have some things to deal with when Governor Weld took office in 1991. Our 
Medicaid program had been growing 22 percent a year for the previous three or four years and was 
basically "PacMan-ing" its way through the rest of the state budget. At the same time, you had an 
angry beneficiary community, an angry provider community, an angry physician community -- 
everybody was angry, but the thing was hemorrhaging money at the same time.
<p>
We also had probably the most regulated hospital finance system in the United States, second only 
to perhaps Maryland or New York. Hospital prices were still growing 10 and 11 percent a year. 
Health care costs generally were growing about 16 percent a year. 
<p>
The standard response from a lot of the folks in the political establishment was, "Well, obviously 
the regulatory model isn't being implemented hard enough."  This was directly opposed to my point 
of view, which was that the state's regulatory model was creating the perverse incentives that were 
driving the rate of spending and making everybody so cranky about what they were getting on the 
service delivery end at the same time.
<p>
<b>Deregulation.</b> So we pursued a fairly aggressive strategy on two fronts. The first was to 
disencumber the provider system from the existing regulatory mass. We managed to pass 
legislation that was signed by the Governor in the fall of 1991 that basically deregulated, on 
January 1, 1992, the entire hospital financing system. Among the naysayers, the sense at the time 
was that this was going to ruin the tight rules that had done such a good job of controlling spending 
in Massachusetts. 
<p>
The good news is that health care spending in Massachusetts in fiscal 1994, the last year for which 
we have final year data, was actually up a little less than two or three percent, and hospital spending 
was actually down a little bit. And the hospital industry overall was in pretty good financial shape. 
This was the exact opposite of what the liberals had said was going to occur. Instead, we took the 
lid off on the pricing, and a very funny thing happened: The market worked. This, of course, didn't 
come as a big surprise to me, but I think it came as a big surprise to lots of other people.
<p>
<b>Medicaid.</b> The second was to improve Medicaid. We started with two assumptions. First, 
that markets were good. Second, that doctors were good. A big part of the political problem that we 
had in Massachusetts was that nobody trusted anybody. In 1988, the head of the Massachusetts 
Medical Society went to the national annual meeting of the AMA and referred to Massachusetts as 
the Beirut of medicine. Early on, I made it a point to make sure that we had doctors involved in 
practically all of our major health care initiatives -- and I mean practicing doctors, not unpracticing 
doctors -- because I believed that they would have a lot of very positive and useful and helpful 
insights into how you could go about doing something to fix a very broken Medicaid program.
<p>
We ended up implementing what I think remains today the largest and perhaps the only statewide 
managed care initiative for Medicaid recipients in the United States. It's got almost 650,000 folks 
enrolled, and it's really two programs. We have a traditional HMO program, but that only serves 
about 100,000 folks. That is the straight plan -- a capitated payment arrangement. But the vast 
majority of the recipients that we serve are served through a primary care program managed by 
about 3,000 doctors. 
<p>
One of the things we decided not to do was to compel physicians to participate in this program. 
Rather, we proposed to raise their fee structure, believing that if we raised their fee structure, they 
would be more likely to serve Medicaid recipients. We thought one of the problems we had with 
the old system was that its fee structure was so bad, and its rules were so bad, that a lot of folks who 
otherwise would have been served by doctors were going to hospitals. This was the most expensive 
and, in many cases, the most inappropriate place for them to get served.
<p>
The other thing we learned was that, despite the statewide availability of plenty of good physicians, 
we had unbelievably high utilization of the Boston teaching hospitals as a source for primary care -- 
totally disproportionate to the population it represented -- for our Medicaid population. So we got 
very aggressive about working with the medical societies and some of the other major physician 
groups to try to create a new relationship between the physician community and the Medicaid 
program. 
<p>
One objective was to get care out of Boston and to hospitals in other parts of the state, and to try to 
develop real relationships out in the hinterlands to serve this population. As a result, there has been 
a dramatic decline in the use of teaching hospitals as sources of primary care for Medicaid 
beneficiaries. As you might suspect, this has been good for patient care, good for local physician-
patient relationships, and good for us. We saved a lot of money by giving people a local and more 
appropriate source for primary and preventive and specialty health care.
<p>
The other interesting thing that we did -- based on advice we got from people on the plan side and 
from the physician community -- was hire an independent company to help us help Medicaid 
beneficiaries make decisions about who they wanted to have do their primary care for them, and to 
help solve what I would refer to as the doctor/program conflict.
<p>
There was never anybody they could call, except some 1-800 number in Boston, to get an answer 
about some problem they were having with the Medicaid program. So one of the things we did was 
contract with a private entity to set up a field-based intermediary that could help solve, at the local 
level, physician problems and recipient problems with the Medicaid program. As a result, I think 
we were able to level the playing field and take some of the marketing and enrollment techniques 
that have dominated a lot of the public payer programs on the plan side out of the loop, and we 
created a truly level playing field. We also gave physicians a place to go to get their questions 
answered.
<P>
We now have over 3,000 doctors enrolled in the primary care program. For the most part, we 
survey them, and we have a standing advisory committee that works on particular issues. It has 
been very successful. For example, we discovered we had a big problem with hospitalization for 
pediatric asthma -- just off-the-chart numbers. It didn't make any sense. The standard way to deal 
with that would be to assume that it's bad medicine and that somehow it's the doctors' fault.
<p>
What we did instead was ask our advisory group to start talking to some of the doctors who dealt 
with significant numbers of Medicaid patients to find out why this was happening. We learned 
three things. Most physicians didn't know that nebulizers were covered under the Medicaid 
program. The two primary drugs that you would prescribe to serve kids who had asthma problems 
were on a prior approval list that was a colossal pain in the neck for a physician to get approved, 
and, as a result, they weren't prescribing them. And we found we had done a lousy job of helping 
the physician community understand what kinds of services and medications were covered under 
the Medicaid program.
<p>
So, again, working with some of the professional societies, we went through a major education 
campaign. We took all of the asthma drugs off the prior approval list, made sure people knew that 
nebulizers were indeed part of the program, and used the medical society as our primary outlet for 
information. Information from those of us in the government always ends up reading like 
bureaucratic prose, whereas if it comes from medical groups, it can be translated into a language 
that doctors participating in the program understand.
<p>
The end result has been a gradual decline in pediatric asthma admissions, which -- as the father of a 
four-year-old who has asthma and spends a lot of time with that kid on the nebulizer -- is a big win. 
It's a big win for physicians who want to do the right thing on behalf of their patients, it's a big win 
for the state in terms of cost-effective service delivery, and it's a big win for families who don't like 
to have to sleep on the chair next to the hospital bed for two or three nights while their kid's sitting 
there breathing so hard that every fiber of his being is concentrating on just making sure he gets his 
next puff of air.
<p>
<b>Treating AIDS.</b> The other thing we've done that has been kind of interesting in this area 
is take some of our most difficult populations -- end stage AIDS sufferers, for example -- and ask 
physician groups if they would be willing to capitate to serve these populations. The argument is 
simple: Medicaid is a very narrowly defined program under federal rules, and there are many things 
you can do for AIDS patients that make a very big difference in terms of dignity, quality of life, and 
cost effectiveness that aren't covered under the existing fee-for-service program.
<p>
So, we said to some of the group practices that dealt with a lot of HIV patients, "Look, we'll 
capitate you, and we'll establish some risk relationships so you're not wildly exposed out there, and 
we'll try to sell it to the federal government. The idea here will be that you'll be able to spend your 
capitation on whatever you think the patient needs, which in many cases is not traditional but is 
appropriate for somebody in those circumstances, both from a cost-effectiveness point of view and 
a quality of life point of view. We think this will be good for you. It will get us out of your hair on 
prior approval, we will refrain from looking over your shoulder, and you'll have a lot more 
flexibility about how you treat them. It will be good for us because it will give you an opportunity 
to expand your horizon in terms of how you take care of them, and if we can do it at a rate that 
looks as good, or better, than our fee-for-service average participant, then we win, too."
<p>
But, of course, we had to run it by Washington. It took us a year and a half to get the federal 
government to agree to let us do this, despite the fact that they were going to save money on their 
Medicaid program, because they paid for 50 percent of it. But the results have been astounding. 
Hospitalization, for example, for these folks has been driven practically to zero, and doctors have 
been using all kinds of interventions and service delivery techniques that are very nontraditional to 
improve the way they take care of these patients. It also has moved the knowledge base a light year 
as a result. 
<P>
What was required to make this work was a lot more flexibility on our part about how the physician 
treated the patient. People say, "Well, you can't make capitation work because the population is too 
sick," but people say this about the Medicare population, the over-65s. The best capitated program 
we've put in place is taking care of the end stage AIDs patient. You can't get much sicker than that 
population, and it has turned out to be, in many ways, a big improvement over what we did 
previously.
<p>
And, you know, our Medicaid growth rate this year is less than 2 percent. Our case load adjusted 
growth rate has seen negative numbers for three years now. We have a provider community that's a 
lot happier with what we are doing now than they were with the system before. The client 
community also is a lot happier. But most of it is really a function of giving people, at the level 
where the decisions needed to be made, more authority to make decisions and turning some of the 
incentives around. I believe you can do the same thing with Medicare. 
<p>
<b>Implications for Medicare.</b> When people say the way to fix Medicare is to cut the fees, 
they are missing the point. The way to fix Medicare is to create a system with the right set of 
incentives for both the provider and the patient to do the right thing. More often than not, doing the 
right thing is the cheapest and most cost-effective way to solve a problem. It also assures the 
highest quality.
<p>
I really hope this Medicare debate does not become fear mongering and scare tactics, because there 
is a much larger issue at stake here. The physician-patient relationship is part of it, but more 
importantly, at least from my point of view as a dad, we have to balance the federal budget for our 
children and we have to do it soon. Otherwise we are just ruining the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren and setting up an impossible dynamic for them. It will be impossible for them to 
grow and be successful in this country while carrying this huge debt and its growing interest 
payments.
<p>
<b>Federal Deficits.</b> The final point I'd like to make is also the most important: Medicare has 
to be part of the discussion about the federal budget deficit, as does Medicaid. You simply can't 
balance the federal budget unless you take an honest look at these two programs. As a real deficit 
hawk, whose four-year-old and one-year-old sons are already inheriting four-and-a-half trillion 
dollars worth of federal debt, I'm ashamed that we have let this happen. I've been saying this to all 
the folks that come see me as the chief financial person in the state and whine about this cut and 
that cut. I don't care whose ox gets gored here. I want to see a federal budget that is balanced at 
some point in the next ten years, because I'm jeopardizing the lives and well-being of my children 
by not being willing to bite the bullet on this one.
<P>
The important role that you and Heritage and others can play in this discussion is to drive home the 
core message that balancing the federal budget is something this country has to do. And you can't 
do it by raising taxes. Why?  Because it's a spending problem. It's not a revenue problem.

<b>MINNESOTA</b>
<p>
<b>DR. KEN HEITHOFF</b>: I happen to agree with Bob Moffit's statement that you can't really 
achieve much fundamental reform at the state level, and that's the quandary. Representative Dyer 
has been there, and he's back from the trip. And in Minnesota, we're pretty much back.
We had a Clinton-style plan, just as Washington State did. Let me describe for you the chronology 
of Minnesota Care and how it evolved. When Surgeon General Everett Koop was there in 1992, he 
looked at Minnesota's health care system, which had been rated as one or two in the country in 
terms of quality. He said, "This system doesn't seem to be broken. Why fix it?" 
<p>
It was a political and economic phenomenon. We had a recession. There were a lot of white collar 
workers out of jobs, and the first thing that they were going to lose, because we had an employer-
based system, was their health care benefits. Liberal politicians came back from their little political 
sojourn into the rural countryside in Minnesota and decided that they needed to fix the state's health 
care system.
<p>
They had some very capable help. Although Representative Dyer in Washington and I have been 
there and are on our way back, some of you are going to begin this journey. The template for the 
Clinton-style state-based reform is going to be the same. Whether it's Minnesota or Washington or 
Tennessee or Kentucky, they will all look the same. They all have the same structure, and they all 
follow the same political agenda.
<P>
Nevertheless, after two years of this in Minnesota, I don't think there are any bad people. As 
physicians we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves; nobody else is going to. Regardless of the 
reality, we are seen as a privileged, wealthy class. That's not the reality for a lot of our primary care 
practitioners, but nobody is going to listen to you.
<p>
I used to sit and carp about this in the doctors' lounge. I used to be very angry about it. I'm not 
angry any more. The reason: A lot of our state-based reformers simply have a different philosophy. 
It's not about health care. There isn't a damned thing that you can do, sitting in your office, to 
practice better medicine that will change how this thing turns out.
<p>
First of all, physicians have to understand that it's about economics, and it's about power. We have 
been villainized by the media and by the politicians during the past two or three or four years for a 
very specific purpose. It is not because they think we're bad people, but they have to break the bond 
of trust between physicians and their patients in order to have the kind of government disruption of 
the medical delivery service that they have been attempting. So forget all of the things that you hear 
and read in the papers. Maybe stop reading the papers for a while. Have faith in free-market 
principles, because they're extremely powerful and they do work.
<p>
I am convinced that we are at the low point. Five years from now, we will have a hard time 
recognizing the kind of fear and trepidation that we have experienced in recent years. The classic 
managed care and HMO philosophies will become pass because personally managed care -- I 
think Speaker Newt Gingrich coined that term -- is a much more powerful concept than managed 
care. "Managed care" is a misnomer. It should be called "restrictive care."
<p>
In Minnesota, we started, I think, between 1985 and 1987. Some of our legislators teamed up with 
the Children's Defense Fund. The debate always starts with access, because you can't really get 
people too excited about cost, at least at first. But the debate quickly shifts to costs. Quite frankly, 
this is the fruit of a dysfunctional third-party employer-based system of finance which has become 
unaffordable for employers.
<p>
<b>The Role of Business.</b> I don't happen to share the view that the employers are necessarily 
physicians' enemies. They now understand that they are going to be taken care of by the same 
system. CEOs in our state have come face to face with the Minnesota health care delivery system. 
The legislation collapsed the insurance market into three oligopolies, where 80 percent of our 
insurance products are delivered by three highly integrated, vertically integrated systems. The 
Business Health Care Action Group was instrumental in proposing that health care be delivered in 
that way. But after playing with the "reformers" for two years, they got very frightened by what 
happened. Why?  Because under Minnesota Care, fee for service would be destroyed, but it would 
be replaced by a tightly managed care delivery system. Care would be delivered through integrated 
service networks, and those integrated service networks, by definition, included physicians, 
hospitals, and an insurance company.
<p>
There were only a few people that could play in such a marketplace, and it was, in fact, promoted 
by this Business Health Care Action Group. They put out a request for proposal which could only 
be answered by such a very, very strongly integrated service network. But after two years of 
working with that, and seeing the competitive market collapse, they became very frightened. About 
a month to six weeks ago, they did a 180 degree about-face. They have announced their intention to 
contract directly with competing physician groups rather than obtain coverage through health plans. 
They are all self-insured employers. This is a watershed event, not just for Minnesota, but for the 
nation as a whole. 
<p>
The business leaders have gone to the health plans, the health plan not being an arrangement 
between the physician and the patients, and have said, "You know, we're really sick and tired of 
paying you guys millions of dollars and having all the recipients [the doctors] be upset about it."  
Who is upset?  The providers, the patients, and even the employers. The people who are buying the 
plans are not the people who are receiving the care. 
<p>
So now they are saying, "We want to contract directly with the physician organizations for our 
health care. We want to put the health plan outside of the physician-patient relationship, not 
between it."  The health plans have become huge oligopolies; we have a $2.2 billion organization 
which used to be our physicians' health plan -- it became United Health Care when the state 
government declared that physicians couldn't own it. United Health Care now has $2.6 billion of 
cash. Our Physicians Health Plan, which became Medica, merged with 27 hospitals into a $2.2 
billion structure called Allina, and now they're buying out the physicians that started Physicians 
Health Plan.
<P>
We have about five physician-directed organizations in Minnesota, independent physicians who 
have gathered together as an alternative, to practice and to try to stay independent rather than be 
enrolled in integrated service networks. 
<p>
<b>The Political Process.</b> Although they wanted to go to a single-payer system like the 
Canadian system -- the people who began this process were all still single-payer advocates -- there 
were a few people who understood that the single-payer option wasn't politically palatable. They 
tried it in 1991. It was vetoed by the Republican Governor, Arne Carleson.
<P>
Because the Republicans were convinced that the Governor's veto would be overridden and we 
would have a single-payer system in 1991, the Republicans in the legislature had to sit down with 
the Democrats and the Governor. We thus had a situation where both political parties and the 
Governor favored Minnesota Care, even though the people who started that process and who ran 
Minnesota Care from the beginning were dyed-in-the-wool, absolute advocates of the single-payer 
system. They pushed Minnesota Care in that direction, using emotional appeals and saying 
anything but what they were really after. Both political parties in the state went along.
<p>
Minnesota Care became a very tightly regulated, centrally controlled, Clinton-type plan instead of 
the free-market approach it was supposed to be, and which the Governor continued to say it was. It 
wasn't until 1994, when the Governor and the people in the Republican caucuses began to be very 
skeptical of where this was going, that the Governor reversed course and wrote an open letter to 
Minnesotans expressing concern over the direction of Minnesota Care. 
<p>
Minnesota Care was an incremental bill. It started in 1992, but it wasn't to be fully implemented 
until 1997. It set up a series of stepping stones along the way. The Governor signed the bill, but in 
the open letter to the people of Minnesota in 1994, he raised some very significant questions. At the 
same time, I had been working with Representative Jim Ramstad, and I had also obtained 
considerable material from The Heritage Foundation, which was really pushing for free-market 
health reform. Senior Republicans came to me and said, "Put your money where your mouth is. If 
you really want to pursue a free-market approach, if you want to have something, let's start a health 
care task force. But it has to be self-funding."
<p>
We started with an initial funding of about $18,000 and took a multidisciplinary approach to health 
care reform. The idea was to educate the legislators because it was appalling to me that after two 
years of this national and state debate, when you would think that all the legislators would be 
unequivocally informed about health care, the fact was that most of them were not. Everybody told 
them that health care was too difficult to understand. For most people, that was a convenient excuse 
for not putting forth the effort to become informed, and they really didn't understand it.
<p>
We held field hearings. We went to regional briefings for all the candidates before the election. We 
sat down with all the incumbents. We sat down with all of the new prospective candidates. We used 
Heritage Foundation materials extensively, explaining the relationship between the health insurance 
markets, tax policies, and the health care "crisis."
<P>
Initially, we couldn't talk about Minnesota Care because it was supported by the Republican Party 
leadership. We started with an anti-single-payer slant, or an anti-Clinton slant. But it was quite 
interesting that, when we talked specifically about what was bad about the Clinton health care plan, 
they had been around Minnesota Care long enough to know they were similar in many respects.
<p>
We formed a legislative subcommittee which drafted an alternative bill. I would invite you to look 
into this educational process, because it's wonderful to be inside the process and not a special-
interest lobbyist on the outside, not a physician who's complaining about something or looking for 
something. If you are promoting solid information -- which is a good policy for all, not just 
providers -- they come to trust you. The information that you're giving is something that is good for 
them and that is good for their constituents.
<p>
As a result, we drafted a bill, an alternative to Minnesota Care, which was the first time that this 
had even been contemplated. The Governor did not openly support the process. But then came the 
1994 election. We had two of the old guard of the Minnesota Republican Party who decided they 
would not run for re-election, and it gave us a chance for new blood and new leadership. The end 
result was that we proposed the bill and crafted a bill with providers, with the physicians and 
patients, with insurance people, with nurses, chiropractors, and dentists. Everybody got involved.
<p>
At the same time, we got involved in politics. We had 3,000 members. We had 800 major 
contributors, and we raised $86,000. We participated in probably six major campaigns. We worked 
closely with Rod Grams in his successful Senate bid. I personally wrote a letter to 14,000 health 
care providers in Minnesota about two weeks before the election, and a lot of those people 
contributed individually.
<p>
In the meantime, our task force crafted a reform bill. Because it had business input, and because it 
had insurance industry input, as well as provider and consumer input, it was well crafted and 
economically sound. Even though we were still in the minority in Minnesota, we came within two 
votes of passage. We weren't as successful as our colleagues in Washington State, but we came 
within two votes of having our bill supersede Minnesota Care. In the process, because our 
legislators not only were convinced of the correctness of the free-market approach, but also really 
understood it, they talked across the aisles with their Democrat colleagues, and we, in fact, had 
pretty close to a working bipartisan majority. 
<p>
We got the head of the Senate Finance Committee -- a Democrat and probably the most respected 
legislator on both sides of the aisle -- to cosponsor our health reform bill. And because our 
legislators understood the issues, and they were passionate about free-market health care reform, we 
amended the Minnesota Care bill that came out of committee. We slowed and, in some cases, 
repealed some of the more onerous parts of Minnesota Care.
<p>
In the 1994 election, 13 seats were added to the conservative Republican side. Conservatives won 
all five special elections. The Governor is going to be appointing a couple of Democrats to 
positions in the state bureaucracy. We're going to win those special elections, so I think we're going 
to have a clear majority or a working conservative majority in our House, and we're very close in 
the Senate.
<p>
It is remarkable what we have accomplished and how much fun it has been, for somebody who was 
totally out of politics or the policy process before this, to be part of this effort. I had never chaired 
anything like this before. I tried to shy away from it, but I saw my ideas begin to have effect, and 
we continued to show gains and gather momentum. It also would not have been possible if we had 
not been supplied an executive director. The chairman of the Republican Party gave us a 
remarkable young woman who had worked in Congressman Bob Michel's office. She knew the 
political arena. She knew who was important at meetings and how to approach them -- what we 
could and could not say. I got the credit for being the chair, but she was responsible for the success 
that we had in terms of setting up the meetings, the agenda, and providing continuity and vital 
advice and contacts. 
<p>
In terms of education, <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> and <a 
href="/heritage/staff/moffit">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation came out and did a 
remarkable job for us, along with Molly Bordonaro from the American Legislative Exchange 
Council. The education of legislators was (and continues to be) the most important function we 
perform. We are back, and what we did not get this year, we will get next year. We repealed price 
controls on providers. We put off the mandated universal coverage that was supposed to go into 
effect in 1997. We put that off indefinitely. We also changed the universal defined benefit plan and 
repealed the regulated all-payer system. This was supposed to be left for us independent 
practitioners. It was a highly regulated, impossible situation. Only now are people beginning to 
admit that it was never intended to be implemented but proposed to frightened independent 
physicians to persuade them to voluntarily become employees of the large integrated service 
networks.
<p>
We have come back -- not as far as Washington State, but we are on our way. What are the lessons? 
 First, you should trust free-market principles. They will work. What has been unleashed in this 
debate are the free-market ideas: medical savings accounts, personally managed care, voucher 
systems, and so forth. That is so compelling to me. I have no fear that we independent practitioners 
will continue to exist and that private medical practice will see a real comeback. But we have to do 
nationally what we've done in Minnesota: form larger organizations of independent physicians.
<p>
We have 1,300 physicians in five physician-directed organizations. I sat on two of their boards, and 
it was heart-breaking for me to see these proud professionals go hat in hand to the three large health 
plans, essentially begging for some insurance product that the PDOs -- physician directed 
organizations -- could offer through the health plan. I knew it wasn't going to happen because it was 
not in the interest of the health plans to do so. They don't want us to succeed; they want physicians 
subjugated to their bureaucracies.
<p>
We have been meeting to try to put together a physician-directed organization where all five would 
come together and offer an insurance product. One of the ideas was that physicians and their 
families and their employees -- all 12,000 of us -- would offer a medical savings account (MSA) 
and demonstrate to the employers in our market that we could, in fact, drive down the cost of 
medicine by 30 or 40 percent with an open access, consumer-friendly plan -- to use our own 
practices as a beta test site.
<P>
We are looking at other options. I don't think we can out-HMO the big corporate players, but if we 
come to the market with some very creative alternatives, such as MSAs and managed care in its 
best sense -- best practices, best practitioners, and so forth -- we can succeed.
<p>
Given my recent experience, and the successful momentum generated by a relatively small group of 
dedicated individuals, I have little sympathy for people in the medical profession who say that they 
do not have the time and money to become involved in the political process. I've seen the 
chiropractors do a lot more with a lot less money and a lot more contributions. They were very 
helpful in getting bipartisan support. They also bought into the idea of medical savings accounts 
and wrote a letter of support.
<p>
We have to educate ourselves. Most physicians haven't heard about The Heritage Foundation. I 
think that's a problem. They don't understand that health care reform is not about how they practice 
medicine, but about the perverse incentives of the current financing system; that turning our 
delivery system upside down can cure the ills if the financial incentives aren't damaged. Thankfully, 
that is occurring.
<p>
The underlying principle and meaning of professionalism is a primary focus on our vocation and 
disinterest in economic gain. I firmly believe that 98 percent of the professionals that I practice 
with, and all of you in this room, are interested in taking care of your patients and would just like to 
get back to doing that. But you can't ignore the economics. Instead of playing golf, we have to do 
this. If it's another hour, then do it. You all worked 24 hours a day when you were interns. I think 
you have to go back to that for a short period of time. I don't want to do this for a long time, but I 
think that for the next year or two it is essential.
<p>

<b>WASHINGTON STATE</b>
<p>
<b>REPRESENTATIVE PHIL DYER:</b> Dr. Heithoff talked about sacrifice. I don't mean to 
sound "Woe is me," but I'd like to take you back in history just a little bit. In 1990, in the state of 
Washington, Governor Gardner, the predecessor to our current Governor Lowry, in his second term 
convened a broad, bipartisan, cross-cultural, horizontal agglomeration of business, labor, all the 
players, and called it his Health Care Commission. There were 13 voting members, plus a large 
number of advisory committees.
<p>
I, for 24 years now, have worked in the medical malpractice insurance field, so I come with a little 
bias in understanding the delivery system and the finance system. I worked for the task force 
regarding tort reform, which had been a crusade for me for many, many years.
<p>
I watched as the 13 Commission members, through 1990, leading up to 1992's election, sat and 
narrowly voted for provision after provision. You are going to hear some similarities between what 
Ken talked about in Minnesota and what Washington State adopted, as if the two states were 
literally lying on top of each other.
<p>
For instance, in 1992, the Commission voted, by one vote, to go with the single-payer system. It 
was an insidious setup for what they called managed competition, the system that was introduced 
following the 1992 elections in Washington State. The political complexion of the Washington 
state legislature at that time then became very heavily Democratic, which it had narrowly been for a 
long time.
<p>
I was not an elected official. We had an open district where there was an open seat, a Republican 
district. And I, a white male Republican, found myself facing a female Democratic opponent. I 
won, with 50.4 percent of the vote, less than 51 percent. 
<p>
I went to the legislature as a freshman. I walked into a caucus in the House of Representatives of 98 
members, and the ranking minority leader turned to me and said, "We need a chairman for the 
Health Care Committee. We've got a minor little debate going on on major policy here. Phil, you're 
it. You're all we've got."
<P>
Four days into the legislature, I became the ranking minority member on the Health Care 
Committee, where I watched the passage of a bill that was constantly being revised, with 202 FAX-
headers -- the latest wisdom from Washington, D.C. -- coming into the Democratic caucus, because 
in that spring of 1993, the Ira Magaziner task force had been formed and was, in fact, operating.
<p>
We ended up with a "managed care only" law that had premium caps, a broad-powered health 
services commission independent of public accountability, a uniform benefit plan dictated by that 
commission, and employer mandates. The only difference between the Clinton plan and ours was 
that Clinton was an 80 percent mandate and we were 50 percent sponsorship. We also had alliances 
that were unique geographic monopolies, and government-certified health plans -- a mimic of what 
we saw introduced later here in the lesser Washington, as we prefer to call it.
<p>
In 1993, the liberal mantra was not dissimilar to our friends at Nike: "Just do it."  And in "just 
doing it," you'll see another similarity. It was later admitted, in reviews with the legislators that 
passed the law in 1993, that fewer than ten out of 147 legislators had even read the bill. They were 
caught up in the emotion of the reform rhetoric and compassion for the downtrodden. No 
understanding of either the current system or the damage they were going to do to that system was 
evident. 
<p>
Nor did they understand the dissimilarities between health care financing and health care delivery. 
They would mix their rhetoric in talking about universality and access as if no one was getting any 
health care at all. This was in direct contradiction to the 1986 COBRA, which had said to all 
facilities, "You're going to take somebody in whether they've got a dime to their name or not."  No 
discussion of uncompensated care was contemplated.
<p>
The similarities are dramatic. Dr. Heithoff and I had talked briefly, but in listening to his 
presentation, I could have listened for another hour, because it would have been my speech. It's 
what happened in Washington State.
<P>
I referenced my manic compulsiveness, and I referenced back to his sacrifice. I turned to my wife 
and said, "Let me remind you of a fellow I worked for out of Texas years ago. He told me as a 
young insurance salesman following my departure from Washington, D.C., having worked for 
President Ford and not winning against President Carter, I had to go get a real job. He said, 'When 
you get out there to sell, don't make your competition angry, because they're going to work real 
hard to beat you if you do.'"
<p>
In 1993, I think the latter occurred, because I left that session, and I said, "This is absurd. This was 
a fraud on the people of the state of Washington. It has been a fraud on my fellow legislators. And, 
by God, we're going to turn this thing around."
<p>
I was not alone. There was a large employer community that became concerned, particularly the 
small business community. It was not only the denouement of the Clinton plan, but the denouement 
of my own business. I had to sell my business. I became preoccupied.
<p>
Over a space of 18 months, I did 168 speeches around the state of Washington. I would talk to 
anybody who would listen to me. It came to the point where I thought I would be wearing a 
sandwich board walking in downtown Seattle. I felt like Don Quixote. I had one Sancho, then two, 
then three, then four. And pretty soon, the windmill was no longer ethereal. It became quite real. 
We started being able to predict, and to see, what the implementation of that law would mean.
<p>
Dr. Heithoff referred to Minnesota's as a staged and incremental plan, not unlike the Clinton health 
care plan. We had the same staging, and, in fact, the time frame is so similar it is scary. Ours was 
implemented July 1, 1993, with final implementation in 1999. This is the frog and water syndrome. 
It is easy to take a frog and throw him into boiling water. The frog is not stupid. There's a 
neurological response: The water is hot, and he jumps out. It's not good for the frog. But put the 
frog in a pan of tepid water and turn the degrees up incrementally over time, and he will sit there 
and cook in his own juice. 
<p>
That was the staging of these Clinton-style health care scenarios in both Washingtons. But it 
became their downfall. It gave us time to get the word out. As I began to tour the state, my 
audiences in the fall of 1993 were this Rotary Club of 20 and that Kiwanis of 25. But by the fall of 
1994, in September and October, I was not speaking to an audience of less than 500.
<p>
<b>Business Interests.</b> The coalitions built by the Association for Washington Business 
included Boeing, Weyerhauser, and Microsoft -- names you all know -- along with the National 
Federation of Independent Business. We soon found that we had strange allies. Organized labor 
began to come on board, starting with the traditional Republican labor organizations of police and 
fire fighters and municipal employees. They were affected because they were no longer ERISA-
protected. They are never ERISA-protected, and they had given up cash wage benefits to negotiate 
nontaxable, noncash benefits in health care for the last 20 years.
<p>
When we showed them what the uniform benefit plan was going to do to their negotiated plan, and 
what the community rating on a one-to-one compression -- just like New York's great plan -- was 
going to do, that they were going to get less and pay more for it, we soon started picking up Boeing 
Aerospace 751 machinists' union. And the next thing you know, instead of a 98-member House 
with 33 Republicans, on the morning of November 9 we had 61 Republicans and 37 Democrats. 
Even more important, conservatives got control of the process.
<P>
<b>Political Change.</b> And I became Chairman of the House Health Care Committee with two 
years under my belt, and they said, "Watch out. He's got the gavel."  Well, "By God," I said, "We're 
going to do it," and we did it.
<p>
We had that bill out of committee in three and a half weeks. It was a 47-page bill; 44 pages were 
repealers. Three pages included three things. The first was continued expansion of our basic health 
plan, which is a complement to the Medicaid asset-based program for providing care to the 
uninsured. We agreed: You have to treat the uninsured. We also had the insurance reforms in there 
-- portability, guaranteed issue, and guaranteed renewability. And then we had MSAs. Beyond that, 
and the repealers, we had a pretty tight bill. 
<p>
We passed the bill through the committee and onto the floor of the House. Then we sat there with a 
slingshot, waiting for the Senate to figure out what they were going to do if we sent it over there. 
They panicked, because we started reminding them of the players who had supported the 1993 act. I 
said, "Can you find one who is vocal about the act being good, who is still elected today?"And with 
half the Senate up next year in 1996, looking around them, realizing they had a one-vote majority 
where they used to have a seven-vote majority in a 49-member Senate, all of a sudden two of the 
Democratic Senators came over and supported my bill. That was all it took.
<p>
We passed it out of the Senate and on to the desk of the Governor, who for two years, arm and arm 
with Bill and Hillary, had been touring the nation's capital as a hero of the populace. He was staring 
us down earlier in the session, saying, "I will veto any changes to my health care act."  He now was 
saying, "Because of the failure of Congress to give me an ERISA waiver, I can't have my plan, so I 
have to make it workable by making this change."  An interesting reversal of theme.
<p>
On April 23 of this year, Governor Lowery signed my bill. It was April 22 of 1993 that the original 
bill passed. I missed it by 24 hours: two years to the day.
<P>
What's next?  We have essentially a level playing field and an opportunity for enfranchisement, to 
bring the public back to the table. They have had an education. The federal health policy debates 
were essential to our success in Washington State because they educated the rank and file through 
the media. All we had to do during the course of the debate was say, "They are, in fact, alike. The 
principles are the same."
<p>
So what am I saying to doctors?  Listening to this morning's discussion, I'm noticing that your 
themes here at The Heritage Foundation are not dissimilar to the themes I see in Washington State.
<P>
Your traditional organized medicine is not always your friend. The Washington State Medical 
Association supported the Washington State health care plan. They had a distinct change in their 
Board of Trustees and their executive management. Politically, family practice physicians and 
specialists were engaged in civil warfare. For years, there had been a balance between primary care 
and specialty care, but in recent years there was no longer a balance; primary care had taken over 
organized medicine, and they were going to stick it to the specialists. 
<p>
And they were going to support this Clinton-style plan because it put them in charge, not realizing 
that we never changed the litigation playing field in the courtroom and that the four-week rotation 
in orthopedics for the primary care doctor is going to be adjudged in a malpractice action by the 
standard set by a board-certified orthopod. They are now beginning to wake up and realize that. Be 
careful what you wish for.
<p>
I also found that organizations like the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which 
had 38 members in Washington State, has now over a thousand in the space of 16 months. Doctors 
were bailing out of the state medical association right and left. Traditional medical organizations 
had been critics of mine for two years but are now giving me every opportunity to speak.
<p>
The animosity between providers and financiers as a result of profits and intrusions in clinical 
standards, and between financiers and providers on utilization controls, employers and financiers on 
premium costs, and employers and financiers or employees and financiers regarding deductibles 
and copays, are only a hint of the battles to come.
<p>
To providers, if you are ahead of the curve, my advice would be to get close to the employer 
community. Managed care organizations don't pay for health care. Employers, 87 percent of them, 
are the source of the funds. Politically, you have to build a relationship to the employer, not to the 
managed care organization.
<p>
In terms of your everyday practice, the challenges yet to come are managed care contract provisions 
that intrude upon your ethics and clinical sovereignty. Most of you have signed, I'll bet, a managed 
care contract that says you cannot criticize the plan to your patient. That is an absolute violation of 
your own ethics. 
<p>
Because you can't write contract standards, how can you get around ERISA and get to those self-
funded plans and not let them have those contracts?  I just gave you the clue. I'll have a bill in 
January that does it using your own licensing boards. It will enable you to make it illegal for 
yourself, under your license, to sign a contract with those provisions that's not ERISA-protected for 
those plans, and no plan can operate without a provider.
<p>
Antitrust has yet to come under safe harbor. It doesn't have the right tolerances, and scoped 
utilization review is my next hope in Washington State, where we don't -- and my apologies, 
because I made the analogy to Texas -- but we don't have an RN in Lubbock, Texas, telling a 
radiologist in Seattle what the standard of care is, and how that patient is going to be treated. I want 
to see utilization review that matches the scope of practice. But it can be superior to subordinate, 
not subordinate to superior, in the rank of scope and training.
<p>
So there's more to come. All we did was take the Nike theme of "Do it,"and just undo it. And now 
we're back to a level playing field, but we have a lot of work to do.

<p>        	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT></B>othing could be more heart-breaking than the sight of a baby born with an 
addiction to cocaine. There is very little doctors and nurses can do to ease the pain of 
these innocent newborns, whose mothers' use of hard, illegal drugs during pregnancy 
constitutes nothing less than blatant child abuse.</P>
<P>	Walk into the neonatal unit of any hospital in America, and you will see crack-
cocaine babies. Some cry and shake uncontrollably. They refuse to take food. Many die.</P> 
<P>	And those who survive are far more likely than other children to be sentenced to 
lives of behavioral problems, birth defects, and learning disabilities.</P>
<P>	Nationwide, one in 10 children born has been exposed to cocaine in the womb. 
This condition affects 350,000 babies a year. Our society can address this problem 
effectively. We can significantly reduce this type of child abuse. Unfotunately, the policy 
of the Clinton administration is to protect, not the children, but the "rights" of the mothers 
to escape the consequences of their actions.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, when I was serving as a circuit solicitor in South Carolina, I 
became aware of the growing problem of crack-cocaine babies at Charleston's Medical 
Unversity of South Carolina (MUSC). My office worked with the hospital to aggressively 
confront pregnant women with the consequences of their drug use. Over a five-year 
period, we presented all pregnant mothers who tested positive for cocaine use with a 
choice: Either seek drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.</P>
<P>	This became one of the first "crack-baby" prevention programs in the nation. And 
the program worked. Scores of women agreed to enter rehabilitation and stayed off drugs 
for the remainder of their pregnancies. Before-and-after statistics present a clear picture. 
Before the sanctions took effect, 24 pregnant mothers a month tested positive for cocaine. 
Virtually none of them was willing to seek help voluntarily. Then, beginning in 1989, 
when we launched a tough amnesty program, the number testing positive for cocaine 
dropped to five or six a month. Prenatal visits as well as live births at the hospital stayed 
the same. Other states were looking at our success as a model.</P>
<P>	Tragically, the cocaine-baby program, which was clearly saving lives, was 
effectively shut down by the Clinton administration. Under the president's direction, a 
swarm of federal officials came to Charleston making unfounded allegations of 
discrimination and accusing the hospital of violating the "privacy rights" of the addicted 
mothers. The Clinton administration warned us that a private civil-rights suit was 
pending, and threatened to cut off $54 million in federal assistance, or about 60 percent 
of the facility's annual budget. Last year, the hospital finally relented, ending the 
successful intervention program.</P>
<P>    Now, once again, the babies cry out in agony. And once again, hospital staff with no 
legal recourse must watch pregnant women knowingly cause neurological damage to 
their unborn children. MUSC nurse Shirley Brown expressed the frustration eloquently: 
"You just have to sit around with your hands tied and watch them destroy a baby." 
Indeed she is right. If this is what President Clinton has in mind when he calls for a return 
to individual and community responsibility, then this administration faces a profound 
moral crisis.</P>
<P>	Administration officials and representatives of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) called the cocaine-baby program punitive, discriminatory, and invasive. 
In fact, it was none of the above.</P>
<P>	By the late 1980s, nurse Brown and her staff noticed an increasing number of 
pregnant women coming to the hospital--not for prenatal care, but because of 
hemorrhaging or other acute problems related to their pregnancies. In the course of 
treatment, many of these women tested positive for drug use, usually cocaine. Thus the 
program grew out of a deep concern among the hospital staff for the welfare of both 
mother and child.</P>
<P>	At first, the hospital tried to educate the women about the damage they were 
causing to themselves and to their unborn babies. Sadly, hospital workers could not 
convince many of the expectant drug-addicted women to enter a drug-treatment program. 
Most wouldn't even return for any type of prenatal care at all. The women--mostly poor 
and uneducated--received free counseling. They were offered free drug treatment and 
free prenatal care, but few participated in the program voluntarily.</P>
<P>	At the same time, the delivery and treatment of crack babies was putting a 
tremendous strain on hospital resources, as well as on the moral sensibilities of hospital 
personnel. Normal neonatal delivery costs can be as low as $500 per baby, but the costs 
of cocaine babies and the intense postnatal care they require have increased 
tremendously. The hospital has seen bills reach $750,000.  Most are born to welfare 
mothers, so Medicaid and the hospital were picking up the bill. According to the General 
Accounting Office, a single cocaine baby can run up a lifetime tab of $1 million in 
medical and educational costs.</P>
<P>	At the time we launched the cocaine baby program in Charleston, I was circuit 
solicitor. Last year, I was elected attorney general for South Carolina, and now view the 
problem from a statewide perspective. Hospitals across our state see drug-damaged 
babies with growing frequency. In every major city in the country, hospitals have units 
devoted to crack mothers and crack babies. But no one dares to forcefully address the 
causes of the problem. We are merely watching it happen and paying an increasingly high 
price in dollars and human suffering. We saw an opportunity to make a difference.</P>
<P>	During the operation of the cocaine-baby program in Charleston, everyone 
concerned was brought to the table--social workers, people from Charleston County 
Substance Abuse, drug-rehabilitation specialists, law-enforcement officials, hospital 
officials, and my office, which was willing to prosecute when necessary. We all agreed 
on one principle: We needed a program that used not only a carrot, but a real and very 
firm stick.</P>
<P>	Those who argued most forcefully for the cocaine-baby program were people who 
dealt with drug addiction every day: the rehabilitation specialists. They told us that 
"unless you have sanctions in place, unless you understand the basic irresponsibility of 
these drug-addicted women, it won't work."</P> 
<P>	Working closely with Chief Reuben Greenberg of the Charleston Police 
Department, we set up an amnesty program with sanctions for those who don't abide by 
the rules. Whenever a prenatal patient tested positive for drugs, hospital staff first 
counseled the mother about what she was doing to her unborn baby. They presented her 
with a letter from the solicitor's office explaining that she faced arrest and prosecution 
(crack cocaine use is a felony in South Carolina) if she refused treatment. The solicitor's 
office then promised to drop all charges if the woman successfully completed a drug-
treatment program. We saw this as a child-abuse prevention program with a goal of 
producing a healthy child.</P>
<P>	We had solid legal grounds to act in this manner, especially in the third trimester 
of the pregnancy. During the final trimester, the fetus is regarded as viable, that is, 
capable of sustaining life on its own, and is therefore granted significant protections 
under both federal and state law. Indeed, the viable fetus is a person under the law. In this 
legal context, we offered pregnant women immunity from prosecution, free medical 
services, and free access to a program of drug rehabilitation. All we asked of them in 
return was to enter the program in good faith and to stop abusing their unborn children 
with illegal drugs.</P>
<P>	Politically correct resolutions by the American Medical Association and the 
American Pediatrics Association denounced the policy as punitive and unwise. The 
National Institutes of Health also sent down some officials, who made the incredible 
claim that the hospital was conducting coercive experiments on pregnant women. Then 
the Clinton administration, ideologically driven by the absurd notion that a woman's 
privacy rights overrule a mother's most basic responsibility to her own child, would not 
allow us to protect the lives of the babies or their self-destructive mothers. Donna 
Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent an investigative team from the 
department's ethics division. One HHS official, without offering any evidence, claimed 
the program had "a chilling effect on minority pregnant women seeking prenatal health 
care."</P>
<P>	Of course, the cocaine-baby program was not punitive. The program was not 
designed to put people in jail. It was a humanitarian effort to save lives through tough, 
decisive action under urgent circumstances. In fact, the women involved in the program 
almost invariably avoided jail.</P>
<P>	Most of the pregnant women who tested positive for crack cocaine (after they 
understood their options) agreed to enter the drug program. The small number who 
refused the program were indeed arrested, but nearly all of their cases were dismissed 
because the women quickly agreed to enter the program once they saw we were serious. 
Only two continued to refuse help, and they were ultimately placed on probation. The 
cocaine-baby program was not a punitive "lock-up" program, but an amnesty program. 
And it was working.</P>
<P>	Also, there is absolutely no evidence that it scared anyone away from prenatal 
care. Remember, very few of these women came to the hospital in the first place to take 
advantage of prenatal services. They came because of urgent medical problems related 
either to their pregnancy or to their addiction.</P>
<P>	Opponents of our cocaine-baby program continually failed to understand that 
prosecutorial action, like a thermostat, can be constantly adjusted. Charges can be 
dropped at any time. We can add conditions.</P> 
<P>	The system has a great deal of flexibility that can be used to motivate 
irresponsible people to take responsible action. Many public defenders (though they are 
not likely to admit it publicly) thought the cocaine-baby program was a great idea.</P>
<P>	Cocaine addicts need a strong motive to mend their ways. And most drug and 
law-enforcement officials also agree. A federally funded research survey showed that 
about 30 percent of those who enter public drug-treatment programs do so only because 
of direct or indirect legal pressure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy noted in a 
1992 report that "the criminal justice system can steer offenders toward drug treatment as 
a condition for deferred prosecution."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration, however, seemed utterly unconcerned with common 
sense or practical solutions to a problem that is literally destroying the lives of adults and 
infants. Within a matter of weeks, HHS also sent investigators from its Office of Civil 
Rights. They alleged that the program was discriminatory toward blacks. Marie Chretien, 
a regional manager in the Office of Civil Rights, claimed in a letter to the hospital that its 
substance-abuse policy "may result in an adverse disproportionate impact on African-
American women."</P>
<P>	It is true that most of the women treated were black. The hospital serves a 
primarily indigent population, and most of the patient population is black. The South 
Carolina Drug Prevalence Study showed blacks were more likely to use cocaine than 
whites.</P>
<P>	Ask Police Chief Greenberg, who is also African American, if this policy was 
discriminatory. He would be among the first to tell you that cocaine use is much more 
common in South Carolina among blacks than whites--and that the black community 
was benefiting most from the prenatal program. "[The program's opponents] don't care 
about the race issue. They're just using this as a tactic," Greenberg says. "I was glad that 
somebody was finally doing something to help kids in the black community. It was 
giving kids a chance who otherwise would not have anything close to an equal playing 
field. At least at the point of birth, that child ought to be given the best opportunity for a 
full and productive life."</P>
<P>	In spite of all this, the HHS civil-rights office threatened in a letter last June to cut 
off federal money to MUSC unless it backed away from its aggressive treatment program. 
"It is the government's obligation to ensure that federal funds do not support a program 
which discriminates," Chretien wrote in the letter. "This obligation entails making a 
formal determination of whether there is a violation of the Title VI regulation--and if 
negotiations for voluntary compliance fail, the initiation of administrative enforcement 
proceedings to terminate federal financial assistance."</P>
<P>	What continues to amaze me, as the state's chief law-enforcement officer, is the 
groundlessness of the discrimination charge. In October 1993, the liberal, feminist Center 
for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a civil suit against the hospital alleging that its 
policy was racially discriminatory, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment. The New York-based center, an offshoot of the ACLU, asked a 
federal judge to issue an injunction against the hospital to suspend the drug-testing 
program. The judge declined, finding no basis for the discrimination charge.</P>
<P>	It's no coincidence, by the way, that shortly after the feminist group failed in its 
lawsuit, investigators from the Clinton administration swooped down on the Medical 
University. I am convinced their plan was coordinated with HHS officials. So is the 
hospital. "It was obvious to us there was collusion between the center and all the federal 
agencies that came down on us," says the university's president, Dr. James Edwards.</P>
<P>	Whether HHS officials would have followed with their own lawsuit is unclear. 
Almost certainly they could not have won in court. But they didn't need to. The hospital, 
dependent on federal funding, never had a chance. HHS agents made an ex parte decision 
that the program was discriminatory. And so they exercised the federal version of the 
golden rule--that is, they've got the gold, so they make the rules.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration was willing to withhold millions of dollars from the 
Medical University, stop all of its Medicaid assistance, shut down its children's hospital 
and its cancer center, discontinue dozens of medical services from radiation oncology to 
pediatric surgery, close down its 558 beds, and force the hospital to turn away its 
patients--all to end a program that offended the liberal sensibilities of Donna Shalala and 
Bill Clinton. A gun was held to the hospital's head, and for the protection of all the other 
patients, the hospital had to agree to give up.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, this saga isn't over yet. The Office of the Solicitor and virtually 
everyone else involved in the hospital's prenatal drug policy is being sued by the Center 
for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of five women who tested positive for cocaine.</P> 
<P>	They want $3 million. It's a complicated suit, but it boils down to a claim that the 
program violated their right to privacy. In fact, the so-called constitutional right to 
privacy does not protect the results of a drug screen, especially not in this case.</P>
<P>	First of all, you don't have a right to use crack cocaine; it's a felony. Second, all 
of the women knew about the amnesty program--there were public-service 
announcements about it, the women voluntarily came to the only hospital in the state that 
sponsored it, they were counseled about the consequences of testing positive, and they all 
signed consent forms before being screened.</P>
<P>	Medical personnel are held legally accountable for the health of both mother and 
unborn child throughout the pregnancy. In fact, malpractice insurance exists to support 
the obligations of primary-care providers in just such cases. If a fetus is damaged by 
inadequate, mistaken, or negligent medical practice, the hospital would quickly face 
lawsuits. So how is it that we have no legal means to keep mothers from seriously 
damaging or destroying their own babies? "If the mother is not going to be held 
responsible," says nurse Brown, "then I don't think any nurse or physician giving 
obstetrical care should have to be held liable."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration apparently believes that infants have no rights at all 
until the umbilical cord is cut. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never said that the states 
do not have a compelling interest in protecting the health of the unborn in the third 
trimester when they can live outside the womb. Indeed, case law in South Carolina and 
elsewhere suggests that society does have certain obligations to the unborn child, 
certainly at very advanced stages of development. South Carolina courts have interpreted 
"person" to include a viable fetus.</P>
<P>	We put tremendous resources into prosecuting child-abuse cases because of the 
great damage done to children, and we make no apologies for that. The cocaine-baby 
program we started in South Carolina was, most of all, a child-abuse prevention program, 
protecting the smallest and the most innocent of children.</P>
<P>	President Clinton and his messengers appear to be fundamentally unconcerned 
with the hundred of thousands of cocaine-addicted women who stagger into the delivery 
units of hospitals across the land. The only remedy they offer to the horribly damaged 
children who result from this madness is to increase the flow of Medicaid dollars, 
provided by taxpayers, to pay a price so large that it is literally impossible to calculate. 
And the greatest frustration of all is knowing that this increasingly expensive tragedy can 
be prevented. One of the most basic responsibilities a mother has is to her child. If a 
mother injected cocaine into the tiny arm of her infant, causing permanent brain damage 
or death, certainly that mother would be arrested and prosecuted.</P>
<P>	Yet that is exactly what addicted mothers do when they consume cocaine 
throughout their pregnancy. In South Carolina, we tried to do something about it. The 
program we created was working. Now it is no more. And as long as powerful federal 
bureaucrats continue to manipulate federal funding to serve a bizarre agenda that is deaf 
to the cries of damaged babies, there is nothing more we can do.</P>
<P>	Why is the Clinton administration stopping us from protecting our children?</P>
<BR>
<B>CHARLES MOLONY CONDON <I>is the attorney general of South Carolina.</B></I>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     After Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell in September
announced his decision to abandon health care reform legislation for
the 103rd Congress, attention shifted immediately to efforts at the
state level. Since then, few state reform efforts have received as
much attention as the referendum on the November ballot in California.
"Proposition 186, the California Health Security Act" would expand
insurance coverage to California residents by creating a single-payer
system much like the one currently in place in Canada. A state-run
health care system, with an elected Health Commissioner exercising
oversight and control over virtually the entire system, would be
financed by new payroll taxes on California employers and workers and
a new surtax on tobacco products.
 <P>    If passed, Proposition 186 would become the law. It would lead to
full state government regulation and control of health care delivery
to all California residents. It would create additional state
bureaucracies, essentially eliminate the health insurance sector in
California, and significantly alter the way in which health care is
provided to Californians. Much like the Canadian system of federal
oversight and control of how health care services are provided,
Proposition 186 would lead to rationing, a black market for health
services, and higher labor costs that would encourage businesses to
move to more "business friendly" nearby states such as Arizona,
Colorado, and Oregon. 
  <P>   Many working lower- and middle-income families will experience
significant tax increases under Proposition 186. While the various
versions of the Clinton plan in Congress sought to disguise the taxes
businesses would pay, Proposition 186 makes a clear statement: Every
Californian and every employer in the state will pay increased taxes.
To help contain costs, the bill calls for strict price controls, a
prescription drug formulary list which will deny millions of
Californians medications available in other states, a global budget or
ceiling for health expenditures, and -- if necessary -- even rationing
of medical services. 
 <P>    For many Californians the term "single-payer" has a certain
appeal, suggesting that the state government will eliminate the need
for much paperwork and be able to get the best value per dollar from
the health care industry. But this is very simplistic. Californians
should remember, for instance, that health care will be run by the
same state government charged with administering other much-criticized
services, such as education and the welfare system. 
  <P>   The most significant provisions in Proposition 186 would:
Create a new position of "Health Commissioner," with general oversight
of the new state-run and state-administered program.
<P>
Establish a "one-size-fits-all" state-established and state-approved
standardized benefits package which would determine the services all
Californians receive.
<P>
Create new commissions, sub-agencies, and programs to assist the
Health Commissioner.
<P>
Impose new taxes on every resident and business in California.
<P>
     While proponents of Proposition 186 paint a very simplistic and
superficial picture of a single-payer system in which the "government
will take care of everything," close scrutiny reveals the
complications and problems inherent in such a scheme. Approximately 32
million residents, legal and undocumented, live within California's
borders. It has been reported that an estimated 6 million do not have
any form of health insurance and are not eligible to receive Medicare
or Medicaid benefits. (Carol Brydolf, "Proposition 186, Health
Services, Taxes," California Journal, Vol. 25, No. 9 (September 1994),
p. 8.) Assuming this figure to be accurate, several questions arise.
<P>
Does dealing with the problems of the 6 million Californians currently
without coverage really require forcing the other 26 million -- who
are insured and satisfied with their coverage -- into a state-run
single-payer system?
<P>
Does every Californian want or need the prescribed government-approved
standard benefits package? A single-payer system means choice of
benefits is sharply reduced.
<P>
How much will California businesses have to pay in additional taxes?
Private businesses in California will be forced to pay an additional
$28.8 billion in new payroll taxes in 1998. Since most payroll taxes
"paid for" by employees show up on paychecks as reduced cash earnings,
a portion should be added to the extra income taxes paid directly by
workers. Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston calculates
this "pass through" means private sector workers will lose $25.4
billion in reduced earnings in 1998 on top of the $9.7 billion
collected in direct personal taxes. And that assumes the new taxes are
sufficient to pay for the new benefits. Analysis by Winston shows that
even if there is a shortfall equal to the lower amount cited in recent
estimates ($32.5 billion), Californians could have to pay on average
an additional $2,213 in state income taxes on top of the $813
envisioned in Proposition 186. This would triple the state tax rate
paid by the average Californian.
<P>
Given the current economic status of California, can residents and
businesses afford to finance such a system? With escalating payroll
costs, many businesses would lay off workers and slow future job
growth or leave the state.
<P>
What will happen to federal programs such as the Veterans
Administration, Indian Health, and Medicaid? Proponents want to use
the funds now going to these programs to fund the new system. But it
seems most unlikely that Congress will approve all the sweeping
changes even though, without this money, the system would be severely
underfunded.
<P>
     Before Californians vote on Proposition 186, they must know the
answers to these questions. Millions of Californians are frustrated
with the current health insurance system, but they need to consider
very carefully the full implications of moving to a government-run
system.
<P>
THE UNIFORM STATE STANDARD BENEFITS PACKAGE
   <P>  Much like the ill-fated Clinton plan, Proposition 186 includes a
major provision dictating the type of benefits all Californians will
have unless they are prepared to pay for additional or different
services out of their own pockets. Chapter 4 of Proposition 186
details not only the benefits Californians would be eligible to
receive, but the scope of coverage as well. ("California Health
Security Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 4, Benefits, pp. 10-17.) 
   <P>  Proposition 186 empowers the California State Health Commissioner
to "Adopt annually a benefits package for consumers which meets or
exceeds the minimums required by law." ("California Health Security
Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 5, Governance and Administration, p.
18.) The benefits every Californian must have are as follows:
Inpatient and outpatient health facility or clinic services other than
long-term care services as defined in Section 25025(a);
<P>
Inpatient and outpatient professional provider services, including eye
care and home health care;
<P>
Diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and other diagnostic and
evaluative services;
<P>
Prenatal, perinatal, and maternity care;
<P>
Durable medical equipment and appliances, including prosthetics,
eyeglasses, and hearing aids, as determined by the Commissioner;
<P>
Podiatry services;
<P>
Chiropractic services;
<P>
Kidney dialysis;
<P>
Emergency transportation and necessary transportation for health care
services for the disabled, as determined by the Commissioner;
<P>
Rehabilitative care;
<P>
Language interpretation for health care services, including sign
language, for those unable to speak, hear, or understand English and
for the hearing impaired;
<P>
Blood;
<P>
Outreach, education, and screening services, including but not limited
to:
<P>
(a) Children's preventive care, well-child care, immunizations,
screening, outreach, and education;
<P>
(b) Adult preventive care, including mammograms, Pap smears and other
screening, outreach, and educational services.
<P>
Prescription drugs subject to approval by the Health Commissioner and
placed on the formulary list;
<P>
Long-term care services for the physical health, mental health,
social, and personal needs of individuals with limited self-care
capabilities, including:
<P>
(1) Institutional and residential care, including Alzheimer's Disease
units;
<P>
(2) Home health care;
<P>
(3) Hospice care;
<P>
(4) Home and community-based services, including personal assistance
and attendant care;
<P>
(5) Appropriate access to specialty consultation within long-term care
settings;
<P>
(6) Reassessment of an individual's need for long-term services,
conducted at appropriate intervals, but not less than once a year.
Mental health care benefits when determined to be medically
appropriate by the Health Commissioner:
<P>
(1)Crisis intervention, including assessment, diagnosis, brief
emergency treatment, and referral;
<P>
(2)Outpatient services, including but not limited to adult day care,
detoxification services, home health care, psycho-social
rehabilitation, and professionally sponsored and professionally
supervised self-help and peer-support programs approved by the
Commissioner;
<P>
(3)Intermediate-level care, including but not limited to intensive day
and evening programs and institutional and residential services.
<P>
(4)Inpatient health facility services as approved by the Commissioner
based on the recommendations of the Advisory Board;
<P>
(5)Professional provider services at outpatient, intermediate, and
inpatient levels of care, including but not limited to individual,
family, and group psychotherapy, medical management, psychological
testing and mental health case management, and coordination of care;
<P>
(6)Diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and other diagnostic and
evaluative services; 
<P>
(7)Prescription drugs.
<P>
Dental benefits;
<P>
Emergency benefits.
<P>
     Even such a comprehensive package, of course, does not take into
account the different needs and desires of individuals and families.
Furthermore, all Californians need to understand that if they suffer
from a particular ailment that is not covered in the standard benefits
package, or for which coverage is available only after joining a
waiting list, they will be denied the necessary medical treatment --
or denied it until they have waited in line -- unless they can come up
with the necessary funds to pay for it themselves. To be sure, the
proposition provides that "The Commissioner may expand benefits beyond
the minimum benefits described in this Chapter when expansion meets
the intent of this Division and there are sufficient funds to cover
the expansion." ("California Health Security Act, Proposition 186,"
Chapter 4, Benefits, p. 16.) But, as will be explained later, there is
little likelihood that sufficient funds will be available to cover
additional benefits for 32 million people.
     As the debate over a standardized plan in Congress made clear,
moreover, Californians can expect special-interest health care
provider lobbying of the Health Commissioner and the advisory boards
and councils. The aim will be to include particular benefits or
services in the fine print of the standard benefits package. If the
lobby is influential enough, the benefit will be added by the
Commissioner. However, the more benefits that are added to the
original package, the higher the price tag. This means higher taxes on
Californians and businesses -- or cutbacks to reduce the costs of
other services.
     <P>
NEW BUREAUCRATS AND BUREAUCRACIES
 <P>    Under Proposition 186, the Office of the California State Health
Commissioner is to be created as an agency of the State of California.
The first Health Commissioner is to be appointed by the Governor and
confirmed by the California legislature. Thereafter, the Commissioner
will stand for election at the same time and in the same manner as the
Governor. Also created within the Office of the State Health
Commissioner is a Deputy Health Commissioner, appointed by the State
Health Commissioner, whose duties include assuming the
responsibilities of the State Health Commissioner should he or she
become unable to perform the duties of office.
 <P>    The powers and responsibilities of the State Health Commissioner
are very broad: "The Commissioner's powers include any and all powers
necessary and proper to implement this Act, and to promote its
underlying aims and purposes. These broad powers include, but are not
limited to, the power to set rates and promulgate generally binding
regulations on any and all matters relating to the implementation of
this Act and its purposes." ("California Health Security Act,
Proposition 186," Chapter 6, Governance and Administration, Article 2,
Sec. 25063, p. 18.) 
 <P>    In other words, one individual will run and administer a new
health care system for 32 million Californians. The Commissioner will
adopt a standardized benefits package for the entire state population
each year, ensure that all health care providers are paid in a timely
fashion, take bids for prescription drug contracts under a state-run
drug formulary, and negotiate or set rates, fees, and prices involving
any aspect of the Health Security System.
  <P>   These responsibilities are unprecedented in scope. To assist in
implementing them, the Commissioner is given power to establish,
appoint, and fund:
<P>
A Health Policy Advisory Board;
<P>
A Regional Administrator with appropriate staff for each System
Region; 
<P>
A Regional Consumer Advocate with appropriate staff for each System
Region.
<P>
The Health Policy Advisory Board
<P>     The Health Policy Advisory Board is to consist of health care and
public health professionals who are salaried and compensated in other
manners as determined by the Commissioner. Proposition 186 does not
specify the number of members who will serve on this newly created
board. While this issue may seem trivial now, such an advisory board
could expand to accommodate many of the special-interest groups which
can be expected to lobby the Commissioner for representation on the
board. Depending on who is appointed, there could be serious doubts
about the objectivity of board recommendations. 
  <P>   
     According to section 25070, the Advisory Board shall:
<P>
Make policy recommendations on medical issues, population-based public
health issues, research priorities, scope of services, and expanding
access to care and Health Security System evaluation;
<P>
Recommend expert task forces, including an expert formulary (drug)
committee, to be appointed by the Commissioner to study and make
recommendations on specialized areas of medical policy and
effectiveness.
<P>
     Californians have great reason to be cautious of this seemingly
innocent provision. The "expert formulary committee" in particular
will have an impact on every resident, especially the poor. A "drug
formulary" is a restricted list of approved prescription drugs that a
program will cover. In the context of Proposition 186, a formulary
committee most likely would monitor the prices of prescription drugs
and determine whether they are "reasonable." It would then make a list
of recommendations to the Health Commissioner stating which
prescription drugs met certain criteria and should be placed on the
formulary list. While the bill does not detail or mention the
criteria, current state policy includes factors such as economies of
scale and presumed therapeutic benefit. If the formulary committee
thinks a price for a drug is "unreasonable," the Commissioner likely
would exclude that particular medication from the formulary list.
Thus, Californians could face a situation in which the drug
recommended by their physician is not available under the system.
  <P>   While a formulary list will affect every Californian's ability to
gain access to the latest drug breakthroughs and medicines, it will
have an especially adverse effect on elderly, poor, and minority
patients. Middle-income and wealthy patients will still be able to
purchase medically necessary drugs out of their own pocket, even if
these drugs have not been approved by the Health Commissioner.
However, current Medicaid recipients and the working poor not eligible
for Medicaid effectively will be denied access to these treatments.
Testifying before Congress against formularies, Hispanic leader
Suleika Cabrera-Drinane pointed out the implications of this for
minorities: "If this plan becomes law, Latinos would once again be
relegated to the status of second class citizens. We would again be
denied equality of treatment under the law. Formularies mean that
people will get sick and die because they couldn't get the medicines
their doctors said they needed." (Suleika Cabrera-Drinane, Founding
Executive Director of the Institute for Puerto Rican/Hispanic Elderly,
testimony before Congress, cited by Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, The Case for the Pharmaceutical Industry, 1993-1994, p.
10.2.) The Hispanic-American community makes up approximately 26
percent of the state's population. It is very likely that this
particular minority will bear a disproportionate share of the adverse
consequences of drug formularies.
  <P>   Given the troublesome history of Medicaid formularies throughout
the states, it is ironic that the largest state in the union might
adopt such a problematic scheme for its entire population.
     
<P>
Regional Administrators
  <P>   Proposition 186 creates what appears to be a mid-level
bureaucratic position of "Regional Administrator" to oversee newly
designed "System Regions." Each Regional Administrator is charged with
such duties as the following:
<P>
Negotiating service contracts;
<P>
Preparing budgets;
<P>
Approving and funding of capital expense projects of health facilities
and clinics in the region;
<P>
Following guidelines and formulas determined by the Commissioner.
<P>
     Essentially, each Regional Administrator will have the power to
negotiate prices for physician, hospital, medical equipment, and
prescription drug reimbursement. He or she will then forward these
prices and further recommendations to the State Health Commissioner,
who must coordinate these figures with the projected expenditures from
other Regional Administrators.
 <P>   In addition to a Regional Administrator, each System Region is
staffed by a Consumer Advocate appointed by the State Health
Commissioner. The Consumer Advocates are charged with, but not limited
to, examining the following:
<P>
Complaints and suggestions from the public;
Proposals to be considered by the Commissioner in the future;
<P>

The Commissioner's plans for changes in resource allocation;
<P>
The extent to which individual health facilities and clinics in a
System Region meet the needs of    the community in which they are
located;
<P>
Any other factor bearing on the effectiveness of the Health Security
System.
<P>
     Proposition 186 is not explicit as to how or by whom the System
Regions are to be designed. It is reasonable to assume the state
legislature will have a role in this process. Should that be the case,
it will be a political nightmare. The reason: each state legislator
will want to craft the System Regions so that each is in a strong
economic position to shoulder the new taxes and administrative
burdens. But more affluent regions will want to avoid inclusion in
regions that are disproportionately poor. Gerrymandering disputes
could tie up the state court system for years.
<P>
THE COST TO CALIFORNIANS AND EMPLOYERS, AND ITS EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 constantly tout the "savings" they
will achieve by eliminating "excessive administrative costs" in the
private insurance market. Not only is it highly questionable whether
government control would bring sharp improvements in efficiency, but
seemingly overlooked is the indirect regulatory cost of the new
bureaucracies, commissions, and agencies that would be created. Even
without these indirect costs, however, the system would be extremely
expensive -- and there is good reason to assume that the sponsors'
optimistic budget forecasts mask a huge problem of underfunding.
  <P>  Proposition 186 relies mainly upon three new taxes to help
finance the new health system: a business payroll tax, a personal
income tax surcharge, and an increased cigarette tax. 
 Payroll Tax. The payroll tax is to be levied upon every employer
within the state. Self-employed individuals are exempt from the
payroll tax but not from the income tax. Proponents of Proposition 186
claim that every employer will be required to pay the payroll tax.
They therefore assume that the current exemption for self-insured
employers will no longer apply to the state of California -- but
according to top congressional staffers, this is not necessarily a
valid assumption. The payroll tax is structured as follows: 
 If Proposition 186 were to pass, estimates the Palo Alto, California,
econometrics firm of Spectrum Economics, Inc., approximately 300,000
jobs would be lost by 1998. (Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts:
1994 California Health Initiative," June 28, 1994, p. 5.) Short-term
job loss in the insurance sector alone is estimated to be 40,000.
Spectrum also forecasts that the wage tax will be passed on in the
form of lower wages in future years. As noted by the Congressional
Budget Office, "An often overlooked point is that the employer share
of the cost of 'employer provided' health insurance is ultimately
passed on to workers in the form of lower wages and reductions in
fringe benefits other than health insurance...." (Congressional Budget
Office, "The Tax Treatment of Employment Based Health Insurance,"
March 1994, Introduction.)
   <P>  A new payroll tax on employers to help pay for the new health
care system will add significantly to the labor costs of firms
currently not offering health insurance. For firms currently providing
health benefits that are not as expensive as the tax cost of the
package mandated in the bill, labor costs also will increase. In
addition to wage reductions that will tend to follow as firms struggle
to offset these costs, some costs also will be passed on in higher
prices for consumers, which in turn leads to fewer purchases of non-
medical goods and services, ultimately resulting in lower employment
in those industries. (Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts: 1994
California Health Initiative," p. 5.) Depending on the size and
financial condition of the firms, the job loss will be felt either
immediately or gradually over several years. 
  <P>   It is estimated by Dwayne Banks of the University of California
that the new wage tax would generate $42.1 billion of new revenue in
1998. (Dwayne A. Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative:
Revenue and Expenditure Projections, 1996-2000," Graduate School of
Public Policy, University of California, July 1994, p. 27.) However,
economics and common business practice suggest that this may be
difficult to achieve. First, many employers would reduce their tax
liability by downsizing their firms or restructure their organizations
by shutting down in-house departments and then creating subsidiaries.
Second, employers who find it economically feasible to self-insure
instead of paying the wage tax will do so, thereby avoiding the new
tax entirely. As mentioned earlier, proponents also are banking on
Congress to waive the ERISA law as it applies to self-insured
employers in California, thereby subjecting these firms to the
proposed payroll tax. If they fail to achieve a sweeping waiver, as
seems likely, revenues will be reduced.
Income Tax. Proposition 186 places an additional 2.5 percent income
tax surcharge on Californians of all income ranges. Residents who earn
more than $250,000 per annum are responsible for an additional 2.5
percent surtax on top of the original 2.5 percent increase. The state
of California already has one of the highest personal income tax rates
in the country.
<P>
 Spectrum Economics estimates that this new income tax will generate
$12.5 billion of new revenue in 1998. However, this new tax structure
and benefits system will have certain direct and indirect costs. For
one thing, some Californians will decide to relocate in other states
to reduce their taxes. For another, the new tax policy and benefit
system will attract three population groups to the state who are
likely to take advantage of a single-payer system: uninsured people
needing high-cost health care, early retirees without health
insurance, and those in need of long-term care and nursing homes.
(Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts: 1994 California Health
Initiative," p. 7.)
<P>
     Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston has conducted an
analysis of Proposition 186 to estimate the tax implications for
Californians working in the private sector. Using a slightly different
methodology from that used by Spectrum, he estimates that the new
income tax will raise $9.7 billion in 1998 directly from Californians
in higher personal income tax payments. But there are other effects.
Businesses will face new payroll taxes amounting to a projected $28.8
billion in 1998. The economic literature indicates that when a payroll
tax is imposed on an employer, an average of 88 percent of the cost is
"passed through" to employees in the form of lower wages (usually
reduced raises). The rest of the payroll tax takes the form of higher
prices or reduced profits. (John C. Liu, "What the CBO Says About the
Tax Treatment of Employment-Based Health Insurance," Heritage
Foundation F.Y.I., No. 16, May 25, 1994, p. 4.) 
<P>     The Heritage study suggests that the combined cost (taxes plus
wage effects) to Californians employed in the private sector will be
$34.8 billion in 1998, or an average of $2,823 per employee. To be
sure, this cost is for certain benefits available under the program,
and many businesses will be paying the new payroll tax instead of
providing benefits. Thus, the net impact on each employee will depend
on the current cost (and its wage effect) of the worker's employer-
provided benefits -- if any.
  <P>   Two important caveats apply to this comparison, however. The
first is that the Heritage calculation takes at face value the claim
of proponents that the new taxes in Proposition 186 are sufficient to
cover the promised benefits. This is very doubtful, for reasons
explained elsewhere. If there were a shortfall, and yet benefit levels
were retained, it would be necessary to raise additional revenue,
probably through increased tax rates. The possible level of these new
revenues is cited later in this analysis, based on the anticipated
shortfall.
  <P>   The second, related to this, is that it is difficult to predict
how people, including residents of other states, will react to passage
of the California proposition. One reaction may be the movement of
some taxpayers and businesses out of the state. Another unanticipated
effect could be the movement of other people into the state to take
advantage of the new program, pushing up costs without producing much
new revenue. Consider, for instance, the proposed long-term care
benefits. Since the legislative language only requires individuals to
reside in California and pay income taxes for a minimum of two years
in order to be eligible for long-term care benefits, younger and
healthier long-term residents will end up subsidizing the costs of
early retirees moving to California. Despite the requirement to pay
income taxes in order to be eligible for long-term care and nursing
home services, the revenue collected by the state is not likely to
cover the prohibitively expensive costs associated with providing such
care. According to the latest U.S. Census data, California already has
3.1 million residents over the age of 65, or approximately 11 percent
of the state's population. (Congressional Quarterly's Politics in
America, 1994, 103rd Congress, (Washington, D.C., Congressional
Quarterly, 1993), p. 97.) With such low eligibility requirements for
long-term care and nursing home services, it will be very attractive
for early retirees not now receiving such generous health benefits to
migrate to California.
<P>
The Numbers in Proposition 186 Don't Add Up
  <P>   Even under the most optimistic scenario, in which all new taxes
and savings yield the amounts assumed under Proposition 186,
expenditures are likely to exceed revenue by a significant margin. A
study performed by Dwayne A. Banks of the Berkeley Institute for
Research on Policy Solutions (BIRPS) concludes that Proposition 186
would run deficits at least between 1996 and 2000. (Banks, "The
California Single-Payer Initiative: Revenue and Expenditure
Projections," p. 27.) The assumptions in this study are based upon
those used by the Congressional Budget Office, the same agency which
forecasts the costs of federal programs as envisioned by the U.S.
Congress. CBO assumptions regarding likely consumer and provider
reaction to a new single-payer-type system were reflected in the BIRPS
study. (Congressional Budget Office, "Behavioral Assumptions for
Estimating the Effects of Health Care Proposals," November 1993,
Appendix F.)
  <P>   According to the BIRPS study, the demand for existing health care
services will increase for two reasons. First, out-of-pocket
expenditures are virtually zero under the single-payer system, which
means that consumers who are currently insured will increase their
demand for certain services (such as chiropractic, substance abuse,
and dental services) for which they generally now must pay themselves.
Second, those who are currently uninsured will have access to services
to which they traditionally have not had access, and this will lead to
an even greater increase in the overall demand for services. (Banks,
"The California Single-Payer Initiative," p. 38; citing CBO,
"Behavioral Assumptions for Estimating the Effects of Health Care
Proposals." )
   <P>  Even under optimistic assumptions, the BIRPS study estimates that
Proposition 186 will cost $135.1 billion in 1998. This is the
projected cost of providing the guaranteed benefits to every eligible
California resident, legal and illegal. Revenue estimates which
include the three major taxes (personal, payroll, cigarette), the
federal money gained by the state from taking over Medicare, Medicaid,
Worker's Compensation, alcohol and drug abuse services, mental health
services, public health services, and indigent care services, together
with the projected administrative savings, equals $101.1 billion in
1998. With respect to the ERISA exemption issue, Spectrum estimates
that the cost of care for ERISA-exempt workers would roughly equal the
payroll tax, thus having little effect on Proposition 186's expected
deficit. (Spectrum Economics, "Proposition 186: Alternative Estimates
of Cost and Revenues," August 15, 1994, p. 2.) This presents the
California State Health Commissioner with a $34 billion deficit in
1998, (Ibid.; Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative," Table
1a, p. 27.) leaving the Commissioner with one, or a combination, of
the following possibilities to address the deficit: implement stricter
cost control mechanisms, request additional funds from the state
legislature (that is, higher taxes), or establish co-payments or
exclusions on certain services that had been fully covered.
<P>
Proposition 186 Relies Too Heavily on Assumptions Based on Fantasy
 <P>    Proponents of Proposition 186 apparently overestimate the
influence of California's congressional delegation in the House and
Senate. While California is fortunate to have two House Members as
chairmen of powerful committees, (Henry Waxman is a 10-term
Representative from Los Angeles who chairs the powerful House Energy
and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment, which has
extensive jurisdiction over public health programs, Medicaid, and
prescription drug pricing formulas. Fortney (Pete) Stark is an 11-term
Representative from Hayward who chairs the influential House Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Health, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and
Social Security programs.) their positions on certain health programs
are not always supported by a majority of their colleagues. The reason
is very simple: Certain changes in the Medicaid and Medicare program
which will benefit health care providers and their constituents in
Beverly Hills and the San Francisco Bay Area may not be as attractive
to a Member of Congress who represents a poor inner-city neighborhood
or a rural area.
  <P>   Furthermore, California's congressional delegation is not known
for its ability to cross political party lines and work together on
projects portrayed as beneficial to the state. It is surprising that
proponents place complete faith and confidence in their
Representatives' ability to obtain the federal waivers that are needed
for Proposition 186 to function effectively.
 <P>    One mistake is to assume that Congress will continue to make
federal payments currently going towards the Medicare and Medicaid
programs in California with minimal oversight. The two primary
committees with jurisdiction over these programs are Ways and Means
and Energy and Commerce. These two committees have 82 members, of
which California provides only 8. A majority of members on each
committee already have stated publicly their opposition to a single-
payer system as envisioned in Proposition 186. Thus, it seems unlikely
that these committees will act to grant California the right to use
federal Medicare and Medicaid payments to help finance the new state
system.
  <P>   Proponents also assume that the federal government will continue
its payments to Sacramento toward all programs such as the Veterans
Administration, Indian Health Services, and armed forces while current
beneficiaries of these programs will be folded into the new state
program. Proposition 186 assumes that California will continue to
administer current medical and public health programs run by the
state. Proponents of Proposition 186 thus assume that California will
be allowed to combine projected expenditures for these programs with
anticipated federal revenues and that this will be the "new revenue"
sufficient for running a new health care system. 
   <P>  The problem is that these projected new revenues -- even if they
do all materialize -- appear to be well short of the amount needed to
finance the promised benefits. The BIRPS study, by Dwayne Banks,
estimates that the state of California could expect to receive $38.1
billion in combined revenue from existing state and federal programs,
leaving a shortfall in 1998 of $32.5 billion for covering workers in
the private sector. (Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative,"
p. 15. The $32.5 billion shortfall is a (reduced) estimate calculated
by Banks in October.)
  <P>   Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston has estimated the
possible tax impact of a shortfall of $32.5 billion in 1998, as well
as the $50.7 billion shortfall envisioned by Spectrum. Assuming no
benefits are cut from the program because of any shortfall, and
assuming California is successful in gaining the waivers it needs to
generate certain revenues from business (which is far from likely),
Winston calculated the new taxes necessary to cover a 1998 shortfall.
He calculated the impact under two specific scenarios:
<P>
SCENARIO 1: 
  <P>   The entire shortfall is recouped through higher payroll taxes on
employers. According to the Heritage analysis, and assuming a
shortfall of $32.5 billion, California businesses would be hit with a
payroll tax of about double the rate envisioned in Proposition 186, if
the program is to be fully funded.
<P>
SCENARIO 2: 
 <P>    The entire shortfall is recouped through higher individual income
taxes. The Heritage analysis indicates that if Californians have to
shoulder a $32.5 billion shortfall by an increase in their state tax
rates, the average Californian would not have to pay the $813
envisioned by Proposition 186 (a 2.5 percent additional tax rate), but
$3,026 (or a 9.3 percent additional tax rate). Thus average
Californians would see their state individual tax rates triple. And
this does not even include the "pass through" wage effect discussed
earlier.
<P>
GLOBAL BUDGETS, PRICE CONTROLS, AND RATIONING
   <P>  Chapter 7 of Proposition 186 is entitled "Appropriations,
Budgeting, and Expenditures." A more accurate title would be "Global
Budgets, Price Controls, and Rationing." Proposition 186 calls for
"Expenditure Limits" complemented by a "Global Budget." ("California
Health Security Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 7, Article 1, sec.
25150, and Article 2, sec. 25158.) According to section 25150, "It is
the intent of the people that expenditures under this Act not exceed
in any year expenditures for the prior year adjusted for changes in
the state's gross domestic product and population." Hence, the central
cost containment mechanism is not competition and consumer preference,
but a fixed system of caps on health care spending.
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 envision a system in which most
health spending in the state of California would be fixed by a
government "global budget" and budgets enforced with spending caps.
Californians who wanted to purchase insurance for a medical service
not covered in the state-approved standardized benefit package, or of
a better quality, could do so with their own resources. Proposition
186 thus would change dramatically the way in which Californians
receive medical care. Since spending on health care at the System
Regions level will be fixed according to regional targets and
allotments based on the state budget, patients and physicians will
have to compete against each other for a fixed quantity of medical
services. 
   <P>  The result would be limits in the availability of services for
Californians now used to obtaining the services their physicians
recommend. (John C. Liu, "Clinton Heavy: The Kennedy Bill," Heritage
Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 197, July 21, 1994, p. 15.) In an effort
to stay within the expenditure limits imposed by the bill while trying
to maintain the level of services demanded, price controls would have
to be applied throughout the health care system. These controls would
have to be severe, since the growth of health care spending in
California would have to be reduced more rapidly than has been
possible so far in most industrialized nations -- including those with
government controls on health care spending (see Table 1). To place
such a tight limitation on expenditures would dramatically alter the
quality and availability of health care to which Californians have
become accustomed.<P>

<P>
     To keep within the expenditure limits, the State Health
Commissioner would have an incentive to reduce reimbursements to
physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment
manufacturers. If this fails, the Commissioner or the state
legislature would be forced to intervene and implement stricter price
controls. But price controls always result in unintended consequences.
They lead to such things as shortages in the latest medical technology
(medical equipment, pharmaceutical drugs, and biotechnology
breakthroughs) and a black market which benefits well-connected and
wealthy consumers at the expense of others. (Edmund F. Haislmaier,

endure under a single-payer system controlled by their government.

<P>

     The alternative to price controls in Proposition 186 doubtless
would be equally offensive to Californians: stripping benefits and
services from the package. Article 8, section 25226 allows the State
Health Commissioner to "Identify and eliminate wasteful and
unnecessary care that is of no benefit to patients receiving that
care." A more realistic interpretation perhaps should read: "If the
State Health Commissioner realizes that the package is too expensive
and that the price controls embodied in the new system won't hold down
costs as envisioned, benefits will be struck publicly from the state
benefits package."
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     In light of the 103rd Congress's inability to pass a health care
reform proposal, it is understandable that Californians are frustrated
and feel the need to take the initiative on their own. However, reform
at the state level needs to be considered carefully.
  <P>   Proposition 186 places heavy new payroll taxes on every employer
in the state, which in turn would inevitably mean lower wages and job
losses in many industries. Like the Clinton plan, which was rejected
overwhelmingly by the American public, Proposition 186 would force 32
million Californians into a state government-designed standardized
benefits package. Global budgets and price controls inevitably would
reduce the quality and quantity of health care for millions of
Californians. And like that of the rejected Clinton plan, the
financing scheme in Proposition 186 appears to be completely
inadequate to fund its promised benefits.
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 envision a sharply reduced pattern
in the growth of future health expenditures, combined with a dramatic
improvement in efficiency, if complete control of California's health
care system is handed over to the state government. Californians
should consider carefully the likelihood of this -- and the
implications if this rosy scenario does not materialize. Are they
prepared to accept the waiting periods experienced throughout the
provinces in the Canadian system? Are they prepared to accept the wage
reductions and job losses that would accompany increased payroll
taxes? Are they comfortable with the idea of a powerful state
commissioner determining the details of their coverage? It is these
fundamental questions that Californians must consider when they cast
their ballots on Proposition 186.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Only one major health care reform proposal guarantees secure and
portable health insurance coverage for every American family while not
destroying jobs, according to a recent study conducted for the
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's
largest association of small business owners. That reform proposal is
The Heritage Foundation's Consumer Choice Health Plan. (See Stuart M.
Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide to the Health Care Crisis, Part II:
The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Talking
Points, February 28, 1992; Stuart M. Butler, "Using Tax Credits to
Create an Affordable Health System," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder,
No. 777, July 26, 1990; Stuart Butler and Edmund F. Haislmaier, eds.,
A National Health System for America (Washington, D.C.: The Heritage
Foundation, 1989).)
<P>
     CONSAD Research Corporation, which conducted the study, is a
major health care research firm based in Pittsburgh. (CONSAD Research
Corporation, The Employment Impact of Proposed Health Care Reform on
Small Business, May 6, 1993. Available from the NFIB Foundation, Suite
700, 600 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20024.) Its
calculations are based on labor impact models developed for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. In the NFIB study, CONSAD
concludes: "The Heritage Foundation's proposal is estimated to have no
effect, severe or moderate, on employment." The other universal health
care proposals analyzed by CONSAD were the "managed competition" plan
developed by the so-called Jackson Hole Group, the employer mandate
plan designed by California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, and
the "play or pay" bill introduced in 1991 by the Democratic leadership
in Congress. Each of these would lead to heavy job losses, because of
the extra labor costs they would impose on firms. Another proposal
examined by CONSAD, the Conservative Democratic Forum plan, would not
cost jobs. But unlike the other plans modelled, including the Heritage
proposal, it would not lead to universal coverage.
     <P>
THE HERITAGE PLAN
<P>
     Under the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, each worker would
have the right to use the money currently paid by his or her employer
for health coverage to purchase any other health insurance plan of the
worker's choice, from any source. Any resulting savings would go
directly to the family. In addition, the worker could direct these and
other funds into a medical savings account to pay for future health
expenses. These workers, as well as workers currently without
employer-provided insurance, would receive a substantial tax credit
for the payments made for family health insurance premiums, medical
savings account contributions, or out-of-pocket health expenses. The
credit would be "refundable," meaning that families near or below the
tax threshold would receive the equivalent of the tax credit in the
form of a voucher.
<P>
     Through this market-oriented plan, consumers are given broad,
powerful market incentives to consider the costs and benefits of
different health insurance plans, and the medical services they buy
directly. They would tend to avoid unnecessary health care. And since
consumers would be far more directly concerned with costs, doctors,
hospitals, and insurers would compete far more vigorously to reduce
costs. Such market incentives and competition, not government price
controls, are the most effective means for reducing costs. (Edmund F.
Haislmaier, "Why Global Budgets and Price Controls Will Not Curb
Health Costs, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 929, March 8,
1993.)
<P>
     At the same time, the Heritage Plan would require each individual
to purchase a basic catastrophic health plan, just as in most states
automobile drivers are required to purchase at least a minimum
liability insurance policy. This health insurance requirement is to
protect other members of society from having to pay for the cost of
care for the uninsured. Through the refundable credit, low-income
Americans would be given government assistance to pay the premiums. 
<P>
     The Heritage Plan thus provides for universal coverage without
imposing extra costs on employers -- and so would not reduce
employment.
<P>
          CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES 
<P>               No jobs lost or put at risk.  
 
<P>THE JACKSON HOLE PLAN
<P>
     The ability of the Heritage Plan to achieve universal coverage
while protecting jobs contrasts sharply with the managed competition
proposal advanced by the Jackson Hole group of policy experts,
including Professor Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, physician
Paul Ellwood, and others. (Peter J. Ferrara, "Managed Competition:
Less Choice and Competition, More Costs and Government in Health
Care," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 948, June 29, 1993; Robert
E. Moffit, "Overdosing on Management: Reforming the Health Care System
through Managed Competition," Heritage Lecture No. 441, April 15,
1993.) This proposal would require all employers to purchase at least
a set of standard federally designed health insurance plans for their
employees and their families, through regional insurance cooperatives
-- or directly from insurers in the case of larger employers. The
proposal seeks to steer workers into Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs) or similar managed care networks in which the consumer's choice
of doctors and services is limited. This proposal is typically called
"managed competition," or the "Jackson Hole Plan." 
<P>
     The CONSAD study concludes that because of the cost of the
mandate to employers, the managed competition proposal would put 16.3
million small business jobs, or almost 25 percent of all small
business employment, "at risk." This means that workers would be
subjected to prolonged layoffs, reduced compensation, or future job
cutbacks and plant closings. The study estimates that between 900,000
and 1.5 million small business jobs would be lost once the proposal
was implemented. These negative effects would occur because the
mandated employer payments for health insurance would raise the cost
of labor and, consequently, encourage many employers to reduce
compensation or to cut jobs.

<P>
CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES 
 <P>
     900,000 to 1.5 million jobs directly lost.  
  <P>   16.3 million jobs put at risk.  
 
<P>
THE GARAMENDI PLAN 
<P>
     Another proposal analyzed in the CONSAD study is advanced most
prominently by the Insurance Commissioner of California, John
Garamendi. This proposal would be similar to the managed competition
proposal, but would finance the health insurance package through a
payroll tax. Under the proposal, employers and employees would pay a
combined 9 percent payroll tax to regional cooperatives, which would
make available to families a range of plans meeting minimum
specifications.
<P>
     This proposal bears the closest similarities to the plan being
developed by the Clinton Administration. The CONSAD study estimates
that this proposal would put about 6.6 million small business jobs, or
about 10 percent of all small business employment, at risk of reduced
work or benefits, with from 390,000 to 650,000 jobs eliminated
altogether. This loss again occurs because the payroll tax on
employers raises the cost of labor. The study notes, incidently, that
the proposed 9 percent payroll tax probably would be insufficient to
finance the expected benefits, which would include workmen's
compensation and health care for auto injuries. If a higher payroll
tax were necessary, as is likely, it would cause larger job losses.
<P>
     CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES 
 <P>
          390,000 to 650,000 jobs directly lost.  
   <P>       6.6 million jobs put at risk.  
 
<P>
THE PLAY OR PAY PLAN
<P>
     Another major proposal examined in the CONSAD study is the "play
or pay" plan advanced in recent years by leading congressional
Democrats. (Stuart M. Butler, "Why 'Play or Pay' National Health Care
Is Doomed to Fail," Heritage Lecture No. 329, August 14, 1991; Edmund
F. Haislmaier, "The Mitchell HealthAmerica Act: A Bait and Switch for
American Workers," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 170, January
17, 1992.) This is the primary proposal for employer-mandated health
insurance being considered in Congress. Under this proposal, employers
have a choice: Either they must purchase health insurance providing at
least certain specified benefits to their employees and their
dependents, or pay a tax for similar coverage to be provided by the
government. 
<P>
     The CONSAD study concludes that the additional labor costs
imposed on many firms by this requirement would put 11.5 million small
business jobs, or about 17 percent of all small business employment,
at risk of reduced work or compensation. CONSAD estimates that from
650,000 to 1.1 million Americans would lose their jobs.

<P>
      
     CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES:   
 <P>
          650,000 to 1.1 million jobs directly lost 
  <P>       11.5 million jobs put at risk.  

<P>
THE CDF PLAN
<P>
     The final major proposal studied is a version of managed
competition included in a bill (H.R. 5836) introduced by
Representative Jim Cooper, the Tennessee Democrat, and other members
of the Conservative Democratic Forum, a caucus of conservative
Democrats in the House of Representatives. While similar to the
Jackson Hole Group's proposal, this bill differs in a crucial respect:
It would not require employers to pay for employee health insurance.
It would require employers only to make such insurance available
through regional cooperatives for purchase by workers if the employer
did not choose to pay for it. 
<P>
     Since the CDF bill would not require any increase in labor costs,
the CONSAD study found it would have no significant negative effect on
employment or jobs. The bill, however, does not achieve universal
coverage, unlike any of the other plans analyzed, since the uninsured
likely would remain without insurance. The reason: Neither employee
nor employer would have any new requirement or assistance to purchase
coverage.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
     Most of the leading health care reform proposals, including the
emerging Clinton plan, seek to finance expanded health insurance at
least in part by imposing new financial obligations on employers. This
method of finance has a political advantage. It hides much of the cost
of coverage from those who will ultimately pay the cost -- American
workers. This cost is not just financial. By increasing the cost of
labor in many firms, it would mean fewer jobs and reduced wages paid
to those with jobs.
<P>
     This effect is well understood by economists and business owners,
if not, unfortunately, by the workers most affected. The CONSAD study
actually quantifies these effects. The study indicates that three of
the five major proposals examined -- and by implication the emerging
Clinton plan -- would mean heavy job losses and put millions more jobs
at risk.
<P>
     There are only two plans that would not cost jobs. One is the
proposal advanced by the Conservative Democratic Forum. But while it
avoids job losses by not imposing a mandate on employers, it does not
achieve universal coverage. There is only one plan that leads to
universal coverage with no job losses. That is the Heritage Foundation
Consumer Choice Health Plan.

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 902<br>
June 17, 1992<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>While the federal government seems paralyzed at the prospect of
trying to reform America's $800 billion dollar health care system,
several states are beginning to experiment with promising alternatives
to meet the pressing problems of rising health care costs and the
growing number of the uninsured.
<P>
     One revolutionary proposal is based on the principles of consumer
choice and market competition.  This is the Consumer Choice Health
Plan (House Bill 376), introduced in the Maryland state legislature by
Delegate Casper Taylor, a Democrat from Allegany County, and the House
Economic Matters Committee.  Taylor is Chairman of the committee.  The
Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan would dramatically change health
care insurance in the state and control costs through market forces. 
<P>
     If the legislature enacts the bill, which has the support of key
physicians and business leaders who favor a market-based approach,
Maryland would launch an imaginative demonstration project that would
require the Bush Administration to waive existing federal regulations
in the Medicaid program and in the application of the ERISA law,
(ERISA is the acronym for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974.) which, among other things, governs self-insurance by private
firms.  Waivers often are granted to states, and the Bush
Administration has declared that it favors such exemptions as a way of
fostering state-based health care reform. 
<P>
     The Taylor legislation would establish a new health care delivery
system in Maryland that would build upon current private medical
practice and private insurance, but would enhance consumer choice,
assure access, and control costs.  Among the key features of the
proposal: 
     <P>
         Every Marylander must enroll in a health plan.  
<P>
     Under the Consumer Choice Health Care Plan, all individuals and
heads of households are required to enroll themselves and their
dependents in a health care plan.  Even Maryland citizens receiving
Medicaid benefits would receive a voucher to pay for acute care.  The
only exception to this legal requirement is for individuals covered by
Medicare, the huge federal program that provides health care services
to elderly and disabled American citizens.
<P>
 <UL> All Marylanders would be assured at least a basic,
         comprehensive health benefits package.  </UL>
<P>
     Under the legislation, all qualified health care plans would have
to offer a comprehensive set of benefits that are "comparable" to
those found in typical employer-based insurance, including well-child
care and preventive medical services.
<P>
 <UL> Tax credits and vouchers would offset the cost of a 
         family's health plan.</UL>
<P>
     Every Maryland citizen would receive state tax credits or
vouchers to help buy insurance.  Families normally would receive a tax
credit, but low-income people below the tax threshold would receive
vouchers.  These credits and vouchers would be income-based on a
sliding scale.  The credits or vouchers would cover the full cost of
the standard insurance plan for low-income Marylanders with an annual
family income of $13,359 or less, declining to 50 percent of the cost
of the basic plan for households with a family income over $100,000
per annum.  Marylanders could choose to purchase supplemental
insurance, but this extra insurance would not be eligible for voucher
or tax credit assistance. 
<P>
<UL> Medicaid would be "voucherized." </UL>
<P>
     The entire acute care Medicaid program in Maryland would be
replaced with the comprehensive voucher program for low-income
Maryland citizens.  The new vouchers would pay 100 percent of the
premiums of the standard insurance plan for a family of four below the
official poverty threshold of $13,359.  In other words, current
Medicaid beneficiaries would have access to the same basic health care
plan as every other citizen in Maryland.  Under the federal waiver,
the state share of Medicaid spending, plus the current matching funds
provided by the federal government, would be used to help finance the
vouchers for low-income people.
<P>
        <UL> The tax treatment of health costs would be 
         radically reformed. </UL>
<P>
In return for tax relief in the form of tax credits or vouchers,
health insurance benefits provided by employers henceforth would be
treated as taxable compensation for the purpose of state income tax. 
Furthermore, to ensure budget neutrality for the entire program,
Maryland would institute a payroll tax, to be paid by employers, to be
set at an estimated four percent. (The payroll tax is estimated
because it is set as the amount needed to make the entire program
budget neutral.  Thus it will depend on the program's outlays.)  The
authors of the proposal also expect some savings from reduced Medicaid
costs, increased use of managed care or programs which impose some
controls on the use of medical services, and sharp reductions in the
costs of treating previously uninsured residents.  Funds from these
sources would keep the necessary payroll tax to a modest level. 
<P>
 <UL> Employers would have new responsibilities. </UL>
<P>
     While employees could choose a health plan offered by their
employer, they would not be required to do so to enjoy the tax credits
or vouchers.  Under the legislation, they are free to choose other
health care plans that meet basic state requirements.  For example,
they might choose a plan offered through an employee organization or a
trade or business association.  The employer's new role is to arrange
for the availability of group insurance plans that meet Maryland's new
specific benefit standards.  This means employees could choose any
plan they wished, or a plan brokered by their employer.  Besides
acting as a broker for employees, employers also could supplement
state tax credits with a financial contribution to improve the
employee's benefit plan.
<P>
 <UL> Insurance rules would be reformed. </UL>
<P>
     Maryland insurance carriers today normally underwrite large group
insurance on the basis of experience.  This means rates each year are
based on the previous medical costs of the group.  For small groups,
insurance usually is written on the basis of geography, industry, age,
sex, family status, and experience, including medical condition. 
Under the Taylor bill, insurers would have to institute "modified
community rating" categories, adjusted for age and sex.  Thus insurers
would be prohibited from charging different premiums, or rates, to
different groups within a given area or community, except for
variations in insurance premiums based on age and sex.  In addition,
insurers could not drop coverage for individuals or groups because
they had been costly to insure.  Further, all participating insurers
would have to meet specific financial solvency requirements and
incorporate managed care programs.  This means that insurers in
Maryland would be required to demonstrate their ability to manage both
the cost and the quality of care, and use "common" billing forms.  The
proposed use of electronic billing to process claims is designed to
reduce the cost of cumbersome health insurance paperwork.
<P>
     The debate in Maryland mirrors that now taking place in many
other states and in Congress.  There is a national consensus emerging
on what is wrong with America's health care system:  soaring costs,
gaps in coverage and the fact that over 35 million people are without
even basic insurance protection.  And like most lawmakers, Maryland's
state legislative leaders believe that only fundamental reform will
deal with the health care system's problems and so are examining the
very foundations of the system.  Supporters of the leading health care
reform proposal in the Maryland state legislature, the Consumer Choice
Health Plan, also believe that the key to radical reform is to
introduce strong consumer choice and genuine market competition by
changing an unfair and inequitable tax code that limits the access to
health care by low-income working families and that discourages
families from seeking cost-effective health plans.
<P>
     While there are some significant differences, the Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan broadly resembles the Heritage
Foundation's Consumer Choice Health Plan. (See Stuart M.  Butler,
Ph.D., "A Policy Maker's Guide to the Health Care Crisis, Part II: 
The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Talking
Points, February 12, 1992.)  Both propose universal coverage for every
family through a package of basic health care benefits.  Both would
reform existing tax support for health insurance, replacing current
tax breaks for employer-provided insurance with a comprehensive system
of tax credits or vouchers.  Both would target the greatest degree of
tax relief or public assistance to individuals and families who need
it most.  Both would stimulate intense competition within a reformed
insurance market, requiring insurance companies to seek the allegiance
of consumers rather than merely the consumers' employer.  And both
would finance universal coverage and tax relief in a "budget neutral"
fashion. 
<P>
     While Congress seems unwilling or unable to tackle America's
continuing health care crisis, reform already is underway in several
states.  A variety of approaches are being proposed or enacted,
ranging from "single payer" government insurance systems, to "play or
pay" mandates on employers, to small group insurance market reform
initiatives.  In the unique federal order that characterizes America's
political system, the states are thus fulfilling a traditional role as
laboratories of democratic government.  Maryland, in particular, has a
rich tradition of innovative social and economic policy, and is
setting the pace for health care reform based on spurring consumer
choice and competition.  Indeed, if Maryland's leading proposal is
enacted into law, it could become the model for national health care
reform. 
<P>

THE MARYLAND HEALTH REFORM DEBATE<P>
     In February of this year, the Maryland State Legislature's House
Economic Matters Committee held three days of hearings on the three
major proposals for reforming the state's health care system:  a
single-payer health insurance model, along the lines of the Canadian
system; a "play or pay" proposal, which would require Maryland
businesses either to provide their employees with a private insurance
policy or pay a tax to support a public plan for families not in an
employer-sponsored plan; and a market-based consumer choice plan,
which would give tax credits to help Marylanders buy a plan.  At the
conclusion of these hearings, the Committee voted down the "single
payer" option and "play or pay" proposal, and unanimously reported out
an amended version of H.B. 376, "The Consumer Choice Plan," for
consideration on the floor of the House of Delegates.  In commenting
on the extensive debate and deliberation in the House Economic Matters
Committee, the Baltimore Sun called the hearings an "eye opener" for
state legislators, adding that only one of the three plans being
discussed by the Committee had any chance of advancing.  Said the Sun
editors: 
<P>
 <UL> The enormous price tag of the Canadian-style "single 
     payer" plan remains its major impediment.  This proposal, 
     which would provide universal health care coverage with a 
     state board setting an annual budget for all healthcare 
     spending in Maryland, has only a few advocates.  Nor is 
     there much enthu siasm building for the "play or pay" 
     program, in which employers would provide basic health 
     insurance coverage or be taxed heavily to pay for a state-
     run insurance package.  A drawback to this approach is that 
     it wouldn't lower health care costs, only shift the payment
     burden to businesses. ("Health Care in Annapolis," editorial, 
     The Baltimore Sun, February 18, 1992.  See also, "Consumer 
     Choice Health Plans Worth Discussing," editorial, The Capital
     (Annapolis), February 4, 1992.) </UL>
<P>
     The amended version of H.B. 376 passed the Maryland House of
Delegates unanimously in March.  The bill does not call for the
immediate implementation of the Consumer Choice Health Plan.  Rather
it orders a comprehensive study by a special joint committee of state
legislators to explore the issues involved in introducing a program
based on the plan.  The Maryland State Senate has yet to act on the
measure.
<P>
     Thus while the Maryland state legislature has not completed its
work, the market-based proposal has emerged as the leading proposal. 
The reason, say House lawmakers supporting that plan, is that
Marylanders want to decide for themselves what plan will cover their
families and they are skeptical of government-run health plans. 
<P>

The Problems of the Current Maryland Health System<P>
     If Maryland mirrors the nation in debating the three major
approaches to comprehensive health care reform, the state also
wrestles with the same problems animating the health care debate
elsewhere.  While Maryland is blessed with many fine hospitals and
skilled physicians, for instance, access to these medical services is
a problem for many Maryland citizens.  And just as in other states,
there are large gaps in insurance coverage, with more than 570,000
individuals in the state lacking any health insurance coverage.  As in
other states, the uninsured are concentrated in the work force of
small firms.  Because of high costs, 43 percent of Maryland's small
businesses do not offer health insurance to their workers.  In
addition, costs are rising rapidly for businesses providing insurance
and families paying directly for their care or insurance.  Maryland
businesses generally are seeing premium increases of between 15
percent and 20 percent, and Maryland workers fear the loss of company-
based health insurance.  At the same time, the cost of uncompensated
care given by Maryland's hospitals is rising steeply, along with costs
of the Medicaid program. (See Preamble to House Bill No.  376, as
amended and passed by the Maryland House of Delegates, March 17, 1992. 
According to Nelson Sabatini, Secretary of the Maryland Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene, the Medicaid rolls in Maryland are growing
by 5,000 to 6,000 per month.  See Joyce Frieden and Eric Zicklin,
"Maryland Considers Shift on Cost Shifting," Business and Health,
March 1992, p.  76.)
<P>
     Arguably the major reason for both gaps in coverage and
skyrocketing costs is that federal and state tax laws give Americans
generous tax relief for their health insurance on one condition --
they must secure their health insurance through their work place. 
<P>
     According to Lewin/ICF, a leading economic modeling firm in
Washington, D.C., the revenue foregone by the federal government alone
through the exclusion from taxable income of employer-based health
benefits nationally was $66.6 billion in 1991. The equivalent state
tax exclusion for employer-paid insurance amounted to $8.3 billion
nationwide. 
<P>
     This tax treatment leads to several perverse effects.  Among
them: 
<P>
 1) Benefits are not "portable."
<P>
     The current federal and state tax laws favor only one type of
insurance -- employer-provided plans.  So Americans have a strong
incentive to obtain insurance through their employers.  The result of
this is that health insurance, unlike life insurance, auto insurance,
or homeowners insurance, typically is tied to a worker's job.  If a
worker changes jobs or loses his or her job, the family's health
benefits are terminated.  If the worker is not offered health benefits
from the next employer, or if severe illness strikes between jobs, the
result can be financial catastrophe for the worker and his family. 
<P>
2) Uninsurance is common among workers in small firms.
<P>
     Since many small businesses do not offer insurance, and since tax
breaks in effect are available only for employer-provided plans, many
employees of small businesses are without any insurance protection.
<P>
3) Employees do not question costs.
<P>
     Because most health care coverage is "paid for" by the employer,
workers have the tendency to treat health care coverage as the
equivalent of a "free good." (In fact, any money contributed by an
employer to an employee's health insurance really is part of the
worker's compensation, which in practice means that the worker's wages
are reduced by the employer's decision to offer health insurance.)  As
a result, insured workers have little or no incentive to question the
bills they receive from physicians or hospitals and thus little
incentive to seek the best value for money in the purchase of a health
care plan.  This lack of consumer interest in cost is a recipe for
escalating costs. (See Stuart Butler, Ph.D., "A Policy Maker's Guide
to the Health Care Crisis, Part I:  The Debate Over Reform," Heritage
Foundation Talking Points, February 12, 1992, pp.  4-7.) 
<P>

PROMOTING CONSUMER CHOICE AND MARKET FORCES<P>
     The Maryland proposal tackles these problems by changing the
system of incentives and subsidies operating today.  This change would
make it possible for Marylanders to choose from a wide range of plans
-- not just from the plans, if any, offered by employers -- and give
them a financial incentive to seek the best value for money in making
their selection.  Proponents argue that this consumer choice system
not only would make it possible for the uninsured to obtain coverage,
but would do a better job at keeping costs under control than the
existing system, with its perverse incentives, or a government-run
health care system using price and budget controls.
<P>
     This method of reforming the health care system is similar to
consumer choice proposals at the national level.  One of these has
been advanced by Heritage Foundation scholars.
<P>
     Like Maryland's H.B. 376, the Heritage Foundation Consumer Choice
Health Plan seeks to: 
<P>
          Assure access to at least a basic level of health care 
     for all Americans; 
<P>
          Create a system in which Americans keep their health 
     plan from job to job, a feature known as "portability"; 
<P>
          Introduce cost-conscious consumer choice, a feature 
     now virtually absent from the system, as the driving force 
     to keep costs in check; 
<P>
          Empower consumers with tax credits or vouchers, through 
     a change in the tax treatment of health benefits and health
     purchases, to afford care; and 
<P>
          Reform the health insurance market to make it more sensitive
     to the needs of consumers. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide,"
     Part II.  See also Stuart M.  Butler, Ph.D., and Edmund F. 
     Haislmaier (eds.), A National Health System for America
     (Washington, D.C.:  The Heritage Foundation, 1989); Stuart M. 
     Butler, "A Tax Reform Strategy to Deal with the Uninsured," The
     Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol.  265, May 15,
     1991.  Other market based proposals include:  Mark Pauley, Ph.D.,
     et al., Responsible National Health Insurance (Washington, D.C.: 
     The AEI Press, 1992); John Goodman, Ph.D., et al., An Agenda for
     Solving America's Health Care Crisis (Dallas:  The National
     Center for Policy Analysis, 1991); and Regina E.  Herzlinger,
     Ph.D., "Healthy Competition," The Atlantic Monthly, August 1991,
     pp.  68-81.) 
<P>
     The Heritage Foundation Consumer Choice Plan would phase out the
tax breaks now available to Americans for their company-based health
plan.  The total federal revenue cost of this tax exclusion alone was
$66.6 billion in 1991. (By adding revenues from state and local tax
and other changes, the total amount of revenues available for tax
credits would be nearly $88 billion in 1991 dollars.  See Butler, "A
Policy Maker's Guide," Part II, p.  16.)  This same revenue would be
used, dollar for dollar, to finance a system of tax credits for all
families to offset part of the cost of their purchase of health
insurance, or out-of-pocket medical costs, such as deductibles or
copayments or direct payments to physicians.  All families not
enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare would be required by law to purchase
at least a basic health plan. 
<P>
     If a company provided insurance with the Heritage proposal in
effect, it could do so, and keep the tax deductibility it now enjoys
as cost of doing business for the cost of that insurance.  If a
company were to discontinue its insurance plan, it also could do so,
but it would be required by law to add the monetary value of the
firm's contribution to its health insurance plan to the paycheck of
each employee in the form of wages.  If the company did not have a
plan, the employee would buy his or her own coverage.  In each case,
the employee would receive a tax credit of the value of the plan --
either the plan provided by the employer or the family's chosen
alternative plan. 
<P>
     Under such a consumer-based system, workers previously enrolled
in a company-based plan could decide instead to take the cash value of
their health benefits and buy a plan they felt was better value for
money. 

<P>
THE MARYLAND CONSUMER CHOICE HEALTH PLAN<P>
     The Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan includes many of the
same features as consumer-driven, market-oriented proposals at the
national level.  It would assure access to at least a basic health
plan for all Marylanders.  It sets down a basic package of benefits
that must be offered by insurance carriers operating in the state.  It
includes a sliding scale system of tax credits, related to household
income, to help families pay for coverage.  It requires all
individuals and heads of households to enroll in a health plan.  And
it finances the benefits out of funds generated from three sources:  a
new employer payroll tax of four percent; the elimination of the
current tax exclusion of employer-provided benefits; substantial
monies generated from reductions in the cost of uncompensated care for
the uninsured and changes in Medicaid.  The financing is arranged in
such a way that there is no net impact to the state budget. (Analysis
of Carl J.  Sardegna, Chairman and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Maryland, Inc., in a lecture at The Heritage Foundation, May 27,
1992.  According to an analysis done for Blue Cross and Blue Shield by
the Center for Health Policy Studies in Columbia, Maryland, the
revenue form lifting the income tax exclusion on health care benefits
would amount to $1 billion and the 4 percent payroll tax would yield
$2.6 billion.  Increased employer tax revenues, plus changes in
Medicaid and the elimination of uncompensated care in Maryland's
hospitals would yield slightly more than $1 billion.  The total
revenues from Maryland's tax changes and additional savings would
provide over $4.7 billion for funding tax credits and vouchers.) 
<P>
     Specifically, the proposal:

<P>
1) Requires all heads of households in the state to enroll themselves
and their families in a health insurance plan. 
<P>
     The plan would require all Marylanders, including Medicaid
beneficiaries, to enroll in a health insurance plan offering a
standard benefits package.  A basic benefits package would be
determined by the state of Maryland.
<P>
     Proponents of Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan defend this
mandate on two related grounds.  First, they say, it reinforces the
basic principle that health care primarily is a responsibility of each
head of the household, not of business or the government. 
<P>
     Second, the requirement recognizes implicitly that there is a
"social contract" between the individual and the rest of society when
it comes to health care.  Government assumes an obligation to make it
possible, through financial assistance, for each citizen to be able to
afford what society considers a level of health care that should be
available to all.  In return, the individual must assume a
corresponding obligation to devote a reasonable share of the household
income to purchase basic care and insurance, rather than being a "free
rider" on society.  Thus requiring individuals to purchase health
coverage protects other citizens from having to pick up the tab when
severe illness strikes, just like requiring drivers to purchase
automobile insurance is to protect other drivers and pedestrians. 
<P>

2)  Establishes a system of health insurance tax credits and vouchers.
<P>
     Under the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan, all citizens of
Maryland would receive tax credits or vouchers to help them purchase
insurance.  Low-income Marylanders who do not pay taxes would be
eligible for a voucher.  All other Maryland citizens filing income
taxes would be eligible for a tax credit, which they could receive by
an adjustment in their tax withholdings at the place of work.  The
amount of the credit would be based on the household's income.  In the
case of families at or below the official poverty level ($13,359 for a
family of four), the voucher would be equal to $3,400 per year for a
family of four.  This is based on an estimate of the premium cost of a
standard plan.  For those families above the poverty line, a sliding
scale credit would apply.  Specifically: 
 A tax credit equal to 90 percent of the cost of insurance (with a
maximum credit of $3,060) for families earning between $13,360 and
$26,718; 
<P>
          An 85 percent tax credit ($2,890 maximum) for families 
     with incomes between $26,719 and $49,999; 
<P>
          A 65 percent tax credit ($2,210 maximum) for families 
     with incomes between $50,000 and $99,999. 
<P>
          A 50 percent tax credit ($1,700 maximum) for families 
     with an income of $100,000 or more.  
<P>

3) Changes the health insurance market.
<P>
     The Maryland plan changes the state tax code radically to finance
access to health care for low - and middle-income Maryland workers and
their families and to introduce genuine market incentives into a
health insurance system where today they are virtually absent.  The
plan thus has profound implications for Marylanders.  If enacted, the
plan would mean:
<P>
     Tax relief for a health care plan would no longer be tied
inextricably to an employee's place of work.  This means that the tax
relief for health insurance would be neutral; that is, it would not
favor only employer-provided insurance.  Thus if a family chose a plan
sponsored by an organization other than the employer that family would
receive a tax break.  Today it does not.  Moreover, if a family is not
enrolled in an employer-based plan, the only alternative is to
purchase individual insurance with after-tax dollars, which makes the
cost prohibitive for most middle-class families.  But giving tax
relief to families to purchase health insurance, regardless of where
they work, creates a level playing field for all kinds of insurance. 
Employer-based plans in Maryland, which now enjoy exclusively
favorable tax treatment, would have to compete with alternative plans. 
Workers could, of course, take their money and credits and spend them
on company plans if they wished, or a plan made available to them by
their employer.  But they could also spend it on a plan sponsored by
their union, a trade association, an agricultural, commercial, or
fraternal society, or any other group.  Even religiously-based
organizations in Maryland could offer health insurance options to
Maryland workers and their families. 
<P>
     This change would allow the wide range of options now enjoyed
exclusively by members of Congress and federal workers, who today can
choose from among plans offered from many organizations such as
unions. (Currently more than 35 percent of all of the enrollees in the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) are enrolled in
health plans sponsored by unions or employee organizations.  See
Robert E.  Moffit, "Consumer Choice in Health:  Learning from the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder, No.  878, February 6, 1992.)
<P>
     The available credit would be refundable, making it a voucher for
low-income families.  Any individual could claim a tax credit to use
in purchasing a qualified health care plan.  But persons with no tax
liability would be eligible for a voucher, in effect a refundable tax
credit, to cover their health insurance costs.
<P>
     More tax relief would go to the needy rather than simply to high-
income individuals with more generous company-based plans.  The
current tax-free status of company-based health insurance is very
regressive.  The higher an employee's income, and the larger his or
her health insurance benefits, the bigger the tax break.  According to
Lewin/ICF calculations, the average federal tax break for American
families with household incomes above $75,000 per year is $1,427.  But
a working family earning under $10,000 gets an average of just $50 in
tax relief. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide," Part II, p.  20.) 
<P>
     If the breadwinner in the family works for a small firm with no
health plan at all, which is common among lower-paid workers, then
that family typically gets no tax relief at all for medical bills or
the health insurance it buys. 
<P>
     The Consumer Choice Health Plan rectifies this stark inequity in
the tax code, at least at the state level.  Because it replaces
existing tax relief with a sliding scale tax credit that is larger for
the lower-paid and is refundable, it targets the greatest tax relief
to those who need it most.  
<P>
4)  Reforms the Insurance System and Protects Consumers.
<P>
     The Consumer Choice Health Plan establishes ground rules for
health insurance companies operating in Maryland.  All "qualified"
plans must include catastrophic coverage, must sell insurance to any
Maryland citizen, and guarantee the renewability of the policy.  Also,
plans no longer can deny coverage to an individual or a family because
of a "pre-existing" medical conditions. 
<P>
     The bill also sets up a State Health Insurance Commission to
review Maryland's health care costs and quality of qualified health
plans.  Plans meeting state requirements would be eligible to
participate in the demonstration program, receiving payment of
premiums in the form of tax credits or vouchers.  Insurers also would
be required to operate in a fiscally sound fashion and keep
administrative costs, including the costs of claims processing, under
control.  To help accomplish this, the bill requires each health
insurance carriers to use a common claim form within one year of
enactment, and to issue a standard "benefit card" to policyholders
that can be used in electronic billing.  This would cut both cost and
volume of paperwork in Maryland's health insurance system.

<P>
MAKING A GOOD PLAN EVEN BETTER
<P>
     The deliberations in Maryland have helped change the course of
the national health care debate.  When policy makers at the state or
national level consider models for health care reform, the choice no
longer is restricted to a government single-payer system or employer-
based mandatory insurance, each replete with a stiff regimen of tough
controls on prices, procedures or medical services.  The Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan now offers a third model for state
lawmakers -- a universal health plan based on consumer choice and
competition.  This approach attempts to combine the best features of
private medical practice and insurance with universal access and
direct tax assistance to individuals and families that need it the
most. 
<P>
     There are features of Maryland's existing health care delivery
system that are inconsistent with a market-based approach, such as the
state's policy of comprehensive price setting for hospitals and
mandatory benefits for insurance policies.  But the bill takes the
most important step towards a consumer-driven market by addressing the
financing of the health care market.  In this respect, the proposed
Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan is a major step toward a state
version of the consumer-driven, tax-based universal health care system
now being proposed at the national level by such organizations as The
Heritage Foundation.  Moreover, the Maryland Consumer Choice Health
Plan is a model for reform that can easily be adopted by other states.

<P>
     Some states already are considering similar plans.  In a plan
developed by John Garamendi, the Insurance Commissioner for the State
of California, for instance, all Californians would be guaranteed
comprehensive health care benefits.  Plans would be certified by the
State of California as qualified plans and all residents would have
the right to enroll in any certified plans of their choice.  They
would receive the equivalent of a voucher for the cost of a basic
managed care plan, and would pay out of pocket for the difference in
cost if they chose a more generous plan.  The Garamendi proposal
incorporates insurance reforms and finances the system with premiums
paid by both employees and employers.  While employers would be
required to pay into a central fund for financing the system, they no
longer would need to offer insurance to employees themselves.
<P>
     While the Maryland Consumer Choice Plan is a solid plan for
guaranteeing universal access to health care, there are certain
refinements that could make it even more effective, and that should be
considered by any other state contemplating a similar plan.  For
example: 
<P>

1) Expand tax relief to include the direct purchase of medical
services. 
<P>
     If tax relief were available for out-of-pocket medical expenses
for both individuals and families, not just for insurance, this would
encourage consumers to pay directly for routine medical services. 
With such tax relief available, consumers would be more likely to
forego insurance options with high "front end" coverage of routine
medical services, like teeth-cleaning and routine office visits, in
favor of insurance options with stronger "back end" coverage for more
costly services. 
<P>
     According to a recent Gallup survey conducted for the American
Medical Association (AMA), most doctors do not even discuss fees with
their patients before treating them. (Some 63 percent of the
respondents in a 1992 AMA patient poll revealed that cost of care was
not discussed before treatment, and 57 percent of the respondents said
they would prefer their doctor to discuss his fees.  The Capital
(Annapolis), May 30, 1992.  The same situation applies to hospital
charges.  A survey of hospital charges in northern Florida, for
example, showed that these costs vary widely for the same procedure. 
"Total average costs for seven of the 12 most common hospital
procedures varied from $27,851 to $58,084, a difference of 110
percent," noted the editors of The Florida Times-Union.  The
insulation of consumers to these radical variations of price aggravate
health care cost increases.  See "Value of Hospital Cost Figures
Should Be Determined by Users," editorial, The Florida Times-Union,
April 15, 1992.)  With more direct purchasing of routine medical
services, this would change for at least minor, routine services. 
With tax relief for the purchase of routine out-of-pocket medical
services, workers and their families would shop around for the best
value for their money.  There would be a greater opportunity for the
patient to act as a genuine consumer and enter into a relationship
with the doctor as an engaged patient, rather than as a merely passive
recipient of third party payment decisions.  In such a relationship,
patients would have an incentive to at least question the costs of the
services that doctors now provide and doctors will have incentives to
look at the services they provide to patients more in terms of their
direct and immediate medical benefit to a patient, unbiased by whether
or not those procedures are paid for by a third party.  This would
make for a healthier doctor-patient relationship.
<P>
     Furthermore, just as in other forms of insurance, such as
automobile coverage, higher deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance
invariably means lower premiums for health insurance.  For both of
these reasons, tax relief for the purchase of routine medical services
would help to control health care costs.
<P>

2) Base tax credits or vouchers to family health care costs compared
with income. 
<P>
     The Maryland bill is very generous.  It would give low-income
families a voucher or credit to pay for the entire value of their
health insurance.  But that discourages comparison shopping among
alternative plans for the best value.  Paying a percentage of the
cost, however, encourages families to seek good value.  In addition, a
flat credit means middle-income families with very high medical bills
could still face crippling costs.  But, it is necessary to give
generous help to lower-income families to help them obtain care, so
that price is not a barrier.
<P>
     A way to achieve each of these objectives would be to set the tax
credit or voucher at a percentage based on the amount of gross family
income consumed by health care costs.  The credit system might, for
instance, give every family a basic credit or voucher of 30 percent of
the cost of health care.  But if health care costs were to exceed,
say, 5 percent of gross family income, the credit would be raised to
50 percent.  If the high risk and cost of insuring the family, or high
and unforeseen out-of-pocket expenses, meant health costs exceeded
say, 10 percent of family income, the credit or voucher could be
increased to 75 or 80 percent of the costs.  In this way, any family
-- including middle-class families -- facing very high costs would
receive a high percentage credit.  Families with low costs compared
with their incomes would get a low credit. 
<P>

3) Require employers to make payroll deductions for employees' health
insurance. 
<P>
     Under the Consumer Choice Health Plan, Maryland employers will
serve as a clearinghouse for health insurance options.  If the plan is
enacted, employees will be able to purchase either the employer's plan
or any other qualified plan.  If an employee chooses an alternative
plan to that offered by the employer, the employee must take
responsibility for making timely payments to the insurer.
<P>
     One way to make sure workers made regular payments -- and did not
risk losing coverage -- would be to require employers to make a
payroll deduction for payment of the employees' premiums and transmit
these premiums to the health insurance carrier of the employees'
choice.  Many companies do this now, as a matter of course, for
retirement investment programs chosen by employees, such as 401(k)
plans.  This could be done for health insurance in Maryland and in
other states adopting a consumer choice health care reform program. 
<P>

4) Replace state mandated benefits provisions with annual basic
benefits setting. 
<P>
     In order to make the Maryland Consumer Choice Plan budget
neutral, the authors have proposed a 4 percent payroll tax on the
employer.  This tax will help to pay for health insurance tax credits
and vouchers at current benefit levels.  But these benefit costs are
artificially high today because state law requires insurance to
include in their plans a wide range of "mandated benefits."  Over the
past two decades, more than 800 state laws have been passed in various
states, mandating that private insurance cover specific benefits. 
Maryland ranks second, behind Connecticut and just ahead of
California, in the number of specific insurance mandates applying to
insurers in the state.  Maryland mandates 33 different medical
services, including alcoholism treatment, drug abuse treatment, in
vitro fertilization, chiropractic services, nurse midwives,
optometrists, psychologists, and even social workers.  While mandated
benefits are often politically popular, they drive up unnecessary
utilization of such services and thus the costs of private insurance. 
For example, according to 1991 report of the national Office of
Government Relations of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association,
Maryland's "... outpatient mental health care visits rose dramatically
once they were mandated, from 448,000 in 1983 to almost 800,000 in
1986, an average growth rate of 21 percent per year." ("State Health
Benefits and Provider Mandates," Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, Issue Review, July 1991.)  Donald Hillier, senior vice
president of the Maryland National Financial Corporation, notes that
Maryland's mandated benefits laws contribute an estimated 17 percent
to 27 percent of the costs of a health care plan in Maryland. (Frieden
and Zicklin, op.  cit., p.  76.)
<P>
     Before resorting to new taxes to cover the high cost of elaborate
mandated benefits for the uninsured, state lawmakers should consider
elimination of the mandated benefits, especially since the most
important objective is to provide the uninsured with a basic level of
protection, such as catastrophic protection for themselves and their
families.  A state has an interest in the benefits to be included in a
basic plan, such as hospital and surgical benefits, physician
services, and well-baby care.  But rather than the state legislature
mandating detailed levels of benefits and specific specialty services,
a better approach, which would ensure both control and flexibility,
would be to have the state negotiate a basic set of benefits each year
with insurance companies.  Maryland could reserve that function to the
proposed State Health Insurance Commission, as outlined in H.B. 376. 
This would more easily accommodate periodic changes in clinical
medical practice and assure quality control over plan offerings.  This
approach has worked well at the federal level in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), administered by the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM).  Instead of Congress legally mandating a
set of specific benefits for the federal program, OPM enters into
sensitive discussions with private insurance carriers and determines
benefit levels each year, assuming that any increase or decrease in
benefit levels has a direct bearing on the price of insurance premiums
for federal workers, retirees, and members of Congress.  A similar
approach could be pursued in Maryland.
<P>
     Without detailed state mandates, the proposed Maryland Health
Insurance Commission, or a similar body in another state, could
exercise its authority in meeting the basic needs of the uninsured,
such as major medical hospital and catastrophic coverage, and allow
consumers to pay extra for other services, such as chiropractic care
or nurse midwives, if they so desire. 
<P>
5) Intensify market competition by allowing Federal Employee Health
Benefit Plans to compete in the state on the same basis as for federal
workers. 
<P>
     The heart of the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan is the
right of an employee to choose a plan other than that provided by his
or her employer.  This is a key not only to the empowerment of
Americans to make fundamental decisions about their health, but also
to the engine of market-driven cost containment.  And consumer choice
in health care, while a novel idea for most Americans, is already a
fact for those Marylanders who are federal employees.
<P>
     A model for consumer choice already exists.  It is working and it
is working well.  It is called the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program (FEHBP). (See Moffit, op.  cit.)  Initiated in 1959, this
program is based on the twin principles of consumer choice and
competition.  Nationwide, the FEHBP covers nearly ten million
Americans and has over 400 competing plans, with about two dozen in
any particular area.  These range from traditional fee-for-service
carriers, like Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to 310 health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) like Kaiser Permanente, to employee organization
plans, like the popular Mailhandlers Plan.  The program is open to
every member of Congress, every congressional staffer, some 750,000
members of the postal service, the entire federal civil service, all
365,000 blue-collar federal employees -- indeed every federal worker
from a messenger to a Cabinet Secretary, from the White House janitor
to the President of the United States.
<P>
     Many of the desirable, small group insurance reforms embodied in
the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan -- such as guaranteed
renewability, a prohibition on exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
and open enrollment for anyone who wants to join a plan -- already are
available to employees enrolled in the FEHBP.  The FEHBP is not
burdened by state mandated benefits laws or state premium taxes, and
the precise level of benefits each year changes only after
negotiations between the federal government and private insurance
carriers.  But the final decision over price and benefit packages is
determined by the market -- plans must satisfy the consumer if they
are to survive. 
<P>
     Unlike many private company-based plans, FEHBP also includes 1.5
million retirees, plus their spouses and survivors, who tend to use
far more services than the average American.  What is remarkable is
that even with such a large number of retirees, including retirees who
are ineligible for Medicare, this system generally has outperformed
the private sector in holding down the rate of increase of premium
costs.  During the period 1980 to 1988, for instance, FEHBP premiums
increases averaged 12 percent per year, while typical private sector
plans -- which generally do not include retirees -- ran at 14 percent. 
This year, premium increases in the FEHBP will be 8 percent, while the
estimated increase in all private plans nation wide will average 20 to
25 percent. (Michael Schachner, "Health Care Costs Will Be Boiling
Over Again in 1992," Business Insurance, December 16, 1991, cited in
Medical Benefits, Vol.  9, No.  2 (January 30, 1992), p.  1.)  The
main reason for this effective cost control in the federal system is
that employees shop for the best bargains for their money. 
<P>
     Over 30 FEHBP plans already operate in the Maryland suburbs, and
in most cities across the nation there are well over a dozen plans for
federal employees.  These plans already are certified by the federal
government.  As part of its demonstration project, Maryland could seek
a waiver or some other form of agreement with the federal government
to permit these plans to market insurance to all Maryland citizens who
wish to purchase them, not just federal workers.  Other states
interested in promoting competition in the insurance industry could do
likewise. 
<P>

What the Federal Government Should Do<P>
     The Bush Administration has declared its intention to issue
waivers, or administrative exceptions to the rules and regulations
that govern federal programs, to promote state level experimentation
in key areas of health and welfare reform.  Indeed, as part of the
President's own "Comprehensive Health Reform Program," states are
encouraged to experiment with Medicaid by designing ways to deliver
health care more efficiently.  Indeed, the Bush Administration health
care reform plan encourages vouchers for low-income citizens covered
under the Medicaid program.  When the Maryland state legislature
reconsiders health care reform, the Administration can do three things
to assure the success of Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan:
<P>
     Offer to grant waivers. 
<P>
     The Bush Administration can offer the State of Maryland a waiver
of the Medicaid rules in order to assist Maryland in turning its
current Medicaid program into a full- scale voucher program as
envisioned in Chairman Taylor's original bill.  This would eliminate
the current acute care Medicaid program and allow low-income Maryland
citizens to get basic health care like every other Maryland citizen.
<P>
     Offer to guarantee insurance competition. 
<P>
     The Administration could make arrangements with Maryland to allow
any of the plans competing in the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program in the Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland areas to
participate in any demonstration project authorized as part of
Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan.  This immediately would assure
Maryland citizens strong competition and a wide range of options --
particularly for those Marylanders who now are uninsured.  Moreover,
it would give all Maryland citizens the right to choose from the same
menu of good health care benefits and competitive prices that is
offered annually to Maryland's congressional delegation and to federal
workers. 
<P>
     Urge Congress to reform the federal tax code. 
<P>
     The Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan would make much-needed
reforms in the tax code -- but only at the state level.  To make
state-sponsored consumer-choice plans more successful, Congress should
amend the tax code to introduce individual tax credits for health
insurance and the purchase of services, in place of the current tax
break for only employer-sponsored plan.  Such a proposal has been
advanced by The Heritage Foundation. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's
Guide,"  Part II.)
<P>
     By reforming the federal tax code in this way, the Congress would
make it easier for states to experiment with health care reform.  In
any case, there can and will be no complete reform of America's health
care system, including the removal of the perverse incentives that are
now relentlessly driving up costs in the system, without a reform of
the perverse incentives in federal tax code.
<P>
     The current federal tax breaks for employer-based health
insurance are grossly inefficient, in that they favor employer-based
insurance options to the exclusion of all other types of insurance. 
They are also grossly unfair, in that the larger a family's personal
income, the larger are the available tax breaks.  The current federal
tax system discriminates in favor of highly-paid executives in large
companies with expensive, tax free health insurance packages, and
discriminates against lower-paid workers and Americans who work for
small companies with little or no health insurance benefits. 
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Maryland has a rich tradition of policy experimentation.  It was
an early model for religious toleration in colonial times, and has
since been an innovator in social and economic policy.  In 1902, for
example, Maryland was the first state to enact a workers' compensation
law.  With serious legislative deliberation on a demonstration project
of consumer choice and competition in the health care delivery system,
targeting tax relief to those who need it most and promoting
affordable care among every income category of her citizens, Maryland
once again is in the forefront of innovative social and economic
policy. 
<P>
     Other states also are exploring innovative ways to deliver health
care more efficiently and more widely.  Some, such as California, are
considering consumer-choice proposals. 
<P>
     While the focus of the debate over health care reform has been on
federal policy, the states actually have been reforming health care
within their own borders. (See Michael Tanner, "As Washington Dithers,
States Reform Health Care," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  868,
November 27, 1991.)  Major initiatives are underway in states ranging
from Florida to Minnesota.  Vermont and Maine have enacted significant
insurance market reforms.  Hawaii is already a model for employer
mandates.  And Oregon may prove to be America's first real test of
explicit government rationing of health care in the Medicaid program;
providing treatment for patients with government-approved diseases and
reimbursing doctors for government approved procedures, while
withholding care and reimbursement for unapproved diseases or
procedures. 
<P>
     The State of Maryland has an opportunity to lead the nation in a
new direction.  If Maryland's innovative reform proposal becomes law,
it will create a state health system based on consumer choice and
market competition -- applying the same economic forces to health care
that have assured Americans efficient and economical services in the
rest of the economy.

<h2>A Morningstar for Human Services</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a></b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">E</font>very now and then an idea comes along that is so breathtakingly sensible, one wonders why no one ever thought of it before.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The National Results Council, a new nonprofit organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota, plans to give users of human services the same kind of comparative performance measures available to buyers of cars and CD players.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It will begin by measuring the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation programs that try to find jobs for people with disabilities. With some 15,000 programs nationwide serving 500,000 people, this is a $3-4 billion industry, funded mostly by federal and state taxpayers. Despite all this money, roughly two-thirds of people with disabilities remain unemployed. Yet, astonishingly, there are no industry-wide measures for judging how well individual programs are doing.
<p><table width="160" align="right" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>"For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"When you're choosing between different mutual funds, you can compare their performance in Morningstar," says Terry Etling, the CEO of the National Results Council (NRC). "But if you have a disability and want a job, you don't know which rehab programs have the best track record. And if you're a legislator trying to get the most bang from the taxpayers' buck, you don't know which programs to expand or scale down." Etling ought to know. As a former top official at the Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission, he used to hand out money to service providers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To fill this void, the NRC will compare every vocational rehabilitation program in the country according to two measures of performance:<ul><p><li>	Four months after graduation, what percentage of participants have been employed for at least 30 days earning at least $180 per week? (For some kinds of programs, the earnings threshold will be lower.)<li>	How much does the program cost per beneficiary?</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will then rank the programs according to the benefits delivered and the cost per beneficiary. Rank order will be adjusted according to labor market conditions and barriers to employment, so that programs are rewarded for serving consumers with the greatest difficulty finding jobs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will test its methodology in a pilot study of 90 rehab programs at Goodwill Industries International. Kenneth Shaw, Goodwill's research director, says his organization has conducted internal studies of its programs, "but we think an independent third-party evaluation will have more credibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Shaw thinks the NRC study will help Goodwill do its job better. "We want to know if some of our programs aren't achieving industry standards, and then figure out why," he says. "We also want to identify which of our programs work best, so that we can learn from our own success, and transfer those lessons to our other operations." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That's exactly what the NRC hopes will happen throughout the rehab industry. Robert Walker, the organization's president, is a program-evaluation specialist who used to run a Minneapolis rehab center. He estimates that the industry could improve its cost-effectiveness by 20 to 25 percent, simply by bringing low performers up to the standards of the best in the business. "For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The big question is how consumer information will transform the industry. "Simply pointing to models of excellence isn't enough," says Chris Olander, an NRC board member. "We have to change incentives." Olander is the executive director of New York City's JM Foundation, which conducted a seven-year search in the 1980s to identify the nation's most effective vocational rehab programs. "Guess what? The winners were exemplary but nobody cared. Government and private funders didn't reward the best performers, or punish the worst ones. That's because we don't pay for outcomes in this industry, we pay for quantity of services. We have to start paying for results."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After vocational rehab, the NRC's next target for evaluation will be the larger world of employment and training--a $20 billion industry. It is also considering programs for alcohol and drug treatment, mental health, and teen-pregnancy prevention. One issue the NRC may be able to resolve is whether faith-based alcohol and drug addiction programs have much higher success rates than medical therapies or secular counseling programs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC hopes it can reach five audiences with its information: consumers who can make more informed decisions; service providers who can compare their results with similar programs; government officials who can better direct tax dollars for maximum benefit; researchers and trainers who can help improve programs; and private funders who can invest their charitable contributions for greater impact.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our mission," says president Robert Walker, "is to help human services achieve higher success rates while reducing costs and serving more people."<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Stand for Children rally, held in Washington on June 1, called attention to the plight of the nation's children. However, the unstated, underlying goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and implicitly to criticize those in Congress who have sought to reform it. Thus, while the Stand for Children event properly called attention to the disastrous condition of America's children, it is important to recognize that children are suffering precisely because of the governmental policies supported over the last 25 years by the leading organizations promoting the rally.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The simple fact is that children are suffering because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Designed as a system to help children, it has ended up damaging and abusing the very children it was intended to save. The welfare system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. The current system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, welfare reduces poverty, and so will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not help children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastating effect on children's development.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Americans often are told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This also is untrue.<ul>

<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) already have spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.

<li>When past and estimated future receipts of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is 13 years.

<li>Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than 75 percent will spend over five years on AFDC.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is welfare dependence, not poverty, that has the most negative effect on children.
Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Welfare dependency as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the boy's earnings will be as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy. Research by CBO Director O'Neill also shows, for example, that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will cause a 43 percent increase in the number of illegitimate births within a state. Illegitimacy, in turn, has an enormous negative effect on children's development and on their behavior as adults. Being born outside of marriage and raised in single parent homes:<ul>
<li>Triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children;

<li>Nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity;

<li>Doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and,

<li>Doubles the probability a boy will become a threat to society, engage in criminal activity, and wind up in jail.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful the child will be as an adult. If America's children are to be saved, the current welfare system must be replaced. The automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout; recipients should be required to work for benefits received. Steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Finally, Americans must help children rise upward out of poverty and despair by enlisting the support of those institutions that have a record of real success. The evidence is clear that religious institutions have enjoyed dramatic success in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. In order to help poor children, America must rely on the healing and guiding force of the churches. This can be done by giving poor parents government-funded education vouchers which could be used to send their children to private schools, including religious schools.
<p>

<b>THE FAILED LIBERAL PARADIGM</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The liberal welfare state is founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:<ul>
<li><b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.

<li><b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.

<li><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Welfare is good for kids.</ul>
<p>From this logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The recent reform legislation passed by Congress sought to slow the automatic growth of welfare spending. Thus, it violated the cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system, leading to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment and a prompt veto by President Bill Clinton.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together, they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of increasing numbers of young Americans. It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 1: Raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children.</b> The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty causes such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that poverty causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values that are key to the child's success.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 2: It is very easy to raise family income through welfare.</b> This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 3: Higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life.</b> In certain limited cases, such as when it is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives.
<p>
<b>The Truth About Welfare.</b> In contrast to the failed premises of welfare liberalism are the following hard facts about welfare and children:<ul>

<li>Except in very limited cases, such as those involving serious malnutrition, welfare programs do not yield fewer problems and better life outcomes for children.

<li>Welfare programs intended to combat poverty do not help children but do increase welfare dependence, which in turn is very harmful to children's well-being.

<li>Welfare programs intended to raise family incomes do not benefit children but do significantly increase illegitimacy and single-parent families, which in turn have decisively negative effects on children's development.</ul>

<p>Overall, the wider and more generous the welfare "safety net," the greater the problems of dependence and illegitimacy will become, and the greater the harm to children.
<p>


<b>EXAMINING WELFARE'S IMPACT ON CHILDREN</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high-benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, research published in 1994 by now-Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high-benefit states.<sup>1</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children. Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant. <sup>4</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	O'Neill and Hill conclude:<p><blockquote>

	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states. <sup>5</sup>
</blockquote><p>
	<b>More Evidence on Welfare's Negative Impact.</b> A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher non-welfare income obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25). <sup>6</sup>    However, welfare income had the opposite effect: The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing up, the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.1<sup>7</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests that an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.<sup>8</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare. <sup>9</sup> Similarly, single mothers raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>10</sup>
<p>

<b>WELFARE PROMOTES ILLEGITIMACY<sup>11</sup></b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The welfare system does added harm to children by promoting illegitimacy. The anti-marriage effects of welfare are simple and profound. The current welfare system may be conceptualized best as a system that offers each single mother with two children a "paycheck" of combined benefits worth an average of between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the state. <sup>12</sup>  The mother has a contract with the government: She will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she does not marry an employed man.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		As long as a father and mother remain unmarried, they may obtain income from two sources: the mother's welfare and the father's earnings. However, if the parents marry they must rely on the father's earnings alone. Welfare thus has made marriage economically irrational for most low-income parents. It has transformed marriage from a legal institution designed to protect and nurture children into an institution that financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents who enter into it.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Similarly, welfare has made it possible to raise a child without either the father or the mother having to hold a job. Welfare thus has made a father with low education and skills at best financially irrelevant -- and at worst a net financial handicap to the mother and the child. Welfare has worked like an acid, slowly corroding the social foundation of marriage in low-income communities. All parties -- the father, the mother, and especially the child -- are damaged by this.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single parenthood have become the conventional "lifestyle option" for raising children in many low-income communities. As Washington Post reporter Leon Dash has shown in his book When Children Want Children, most unwed teen mothers conceive and deliver their babies deliberately rather than accidentally. <sup>13</sup> While young women do not bear unwanted children in order to reap "windfall profits" from welfare, they are very much aware of the role welfare will play in supporting them once a child is born. Thus, the availability of welfare plays an important role in influencing a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		In welfare, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for. The current welfare system pays for non-work and non-marriage and has achieved dramatic increases in both. Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single mothers contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. <sup>14</sup> Other studies showing the effect of welfare in increasing illegitimacy are listed in the appendix to this paper.
<p><b>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RISING ILLEGITIMACY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	From the very beginning, children born outside of marriage have life stacked against them. The impact on the child is significant and can be permanent. Out-of-wedlock birth and growing up in a single-parent family means the child is more likely to experience:<ul>

<li>Retarded cognitive (especially verbal) development;

<li>Lower educational achievement;

<li>Lower job attainment;

<li>Increased behavior and emotional problems;

<li>Lower impulse control; and

<li>Retarded social development.
<p>
Such children are far more likely to:
<li>Engage in early sexual activity;

<li>Have children out of wedlock;

<li>Be on welfare as adults; and

<li>Engage in criminal activity.</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The absence of married parents is related to retarded development in early childhood.</b> Illegitimacy leads to delays in development. A study of black infants (aged 5 to 6 months) living in households of lower socioeconomic status in America's inner cities found that male infants who experienced "minimal interaction with their fathers" had significantly lower levels of overall mental development and lower social responsiveness for novel stimuli. <sup>15</sup>  Illegitimate children tend to have lessened cognitive development. <sup>16</sup>  <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup>   Many of these children have problems in controlling their activity (popularly called "hyperactivity"). This lack of control usually is an indication of problems in learning that will arise later in the child's development. <sup>19</sup> The effect on boys is greater, at least in the early years. <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Similar findings were enumerated again in the recent 1992 National Institute of Child Health and Development summary, "Outcomes of Early Childbearing: An Appraisal of Recent Evidence." <sup>22</sup>  And such findings are in line with earlier studies. For instance, Project TALENT, a federal survey commissioned in 1960, which tracked the development of 375,000 high school students from 1960 through 1971, found that children born outside marriage were likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. Once again, all of these effects were greater for boys. <sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>	The absence of married parents risks emotional and behavioral problems during childhood.</b> The effects of illegitimacy continue to compound through childhood. The National Health Interview Survey of Child Health (NHIS-CH) confirms that children born out of wedlock have far more behavioral and emotional problems than do children in intact married families. These problems include:<ul>

<li>Antisocial behavior --  disobedience in school, cheating and lying; bullying and cruelty to others; breaking things deliberately; failure to feel sorry after misbehaving;

<li>Hyperactive behavior -- difficulty concentrating or paying attention; becoming easily confused; acting without thinking; being restless or overactive;

<li>Headstrong behavior -- easily losing one's temper; being stubborn, irritable, disobedient at home; arguing excessively;

<li>Peer conflict -- having trouble getting along with others, being not liked, being withdrawn;

<li>Dependent behavior --  crying too much, being too dependent on others, demanding attention, clinging to adults.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Children raised by never-married mothers have significantly higher levels of all of the above behavior problems when compared to children raised by both biological parents. When comparisons are made between families that are identical in race, income, number of children, and mother's education, the behavioral differences between illegitimate and legitimate children actually widen. Compared to children living with both biological parents in similar socioeconomic circumstances, children of never-married mothers exhibit 68 percent more antisocial behavior, 24 percent more headstrong behavior, 33 percent more hyperactive behavior, 78 percent more peer conflict, and 53 percent more dependency. Overall, children of never-married mothers have behavioral problems that score nearly three times higher than children raised in comparable intact families.44 <sup>24</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Children born out of wedlock have less ability to delay gratification and poorer impulse control (control over anger and sexual gratification). They have a weaker sense of conscience or sense of right and wrong. <sup>25</sup>  Adding to all this is the sad fact that the incidence of child abuse and neglect is higher among single-parent families. <sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Being born out of wedlock increases the probability of teen sexual activity.</b> Boys and girls born out of wedlock and raised by never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually active as teenagers when compared to legitimate children raised in intact married-couple families. This finding applies to both blacks and whites. Children born out of wedlock whose mothers marry after the child's birth appear to be slightly less likely to be sexually active as teens but are still twice as active, on average, as legitimate teens of intact married couples. <sup>27</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents is related to poor academic performance during school years. The risks and consequences of illegitimacy continue through the middle years of childhood and express themselves in poor academic performance. A 1988 study by Sheila F. Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois finds that the longer the time spent in a single-parent family, the lower the education attained by a child. In general, a boy's educational attainment was cut by one-tenth of a year for each year spent as a child in a single-parent home. Controlling for family income did not reduce the magnitude of the effect noticeably. <sup>28</sup>  These findings are confirmed again and again in studies, conducted in the United States and abroad, which which demonstrate that illegitimacy is also associated with lower job and salary attainment. <sup>29</sup> <sup>30</sup>  <sup>31</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents leads to intergenerational illegitimacy. Being born outside of marriage significantly reduces the chances the child will grow up to have an intact marriage. <sup>32</sup>  Children born outside of marriage themselves are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up. <sup>33</sup>   Daughters of single mothers are twice as likely to be single mothers themselves if they are black, and only slightly less so if they are white. <sup>34</sup>  And boys living in a single-parent family are twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as are boys from a two-parent home. <sup>35</sup>  The TALENT study, noted earlier, already had found that children born to teenage parents are more likely to become teen parents themselves. <sup>36</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Illegitimacy is a major factor in America's crime wave.</b> Lack of married parents, rather than race or poverty, is the principal factor in the crime rate. It has been known for some time that high rates of welfare dependency correlate with high crime rates amo
ng young men in a neighborhood. <sup>37</sup>  But more important, a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals found that "the percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary."  The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that there is an association between race and crime is false. Illegitimacy is the key factor. The absence of marriage, and the failure to form and maintain intact families, explains the incidence of high crime in a neighborhood among whites as well as blacks. This study also concluded that poverty does not explain the incidence of crime. <sup>38</sup>  This is a dramatic reversal of conventional wisdom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Research on underclass behavior by Dr. June O'Neill confirms the linkage between crime and single-parent families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, O'Neill found that young black men raised in single-parent families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activities when compared to black men raised in two-parent families, even after holding constant a wide range of variables such as family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment, and parents' education. Growing up in a single-parent family in a neighborhood with many other single-parent families on welfare triples the probability that a young black man will engage in criminal activity. <sup>39</sup><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In vetoing the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, President Clinton has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Clinton Administration's report on welfare, which formed the basis for the President's veto, makes clear a belief that rapid and automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children. <sup>40</sup>  The organizers of the recent Stand for Children rally share a similar view.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		The President's veto and the Stand for Children rally are both founded on the failed hypothesis that combating poverty through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy, which in turn have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's reform.

<b>APPENDIX<br>
Research on Welfare and Illegitimacy</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies conducted in the last decade and a half show that welfare promotes illegitimacy and discourages marriage. Many show that welfare has a dramatically positive effect in increasing the level of illegitimacy in U.S. society. The following is a list of 19 studies on welfare and illegitimacy; of these, 14 have found a relationship between higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows that childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase may be as high as 10 percent. Mikhail S. Bernstam, "Malthus and Evolution of the Welfare State: An Essay on the Second Invisible Hand, Parts I and II," working papers E-88-41,42, Hoover Institution, Palo Alto, Cal., 1988.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	2. Research by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. M. Anne Hill and June O'Neill, "Underclass Behaviors in the United States: Measurement and Analysis of Determinants," Center for the Study of Business and Government, Baruch College, February 1992.

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3. A recent study of black Americans finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates of marriage and higher numbers of children living in single-parent homes. In general, an increase of roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to 24. Mark A. Fossett and K. Jill Kiecolt, "Mate Availability and Family Structure Among African Americans in U.S. Metropolitan Areas," <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i>, Vol. 55 (May 1993), pp. 288-302.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	4. Research by Dr. C. R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found that half of the increases in black illegitimacy in recent decades could be attributed to the effects of welfare. C. R. Winegarden, "AFDC and Illegitimacy Ratios: A Vector-Autoregressive Model," <i>Applied Economics</i> 20 (1988), pp. 1589-1601.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	5. Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent. Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick, "Adolescent Premarital Child Bearing: Do Opportunity Costs Matter?," discussion paper no. 90-23, University of Washington, Institute for Economic Research, Seattle, 1990.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	6. Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in St. Louis has found that an increase in AFDC benefit levels of $100 per child per month leads to roughly a 30 percent increase in out-of-wedlock births to women age 19 and under. Martha N. Ozawa, "Welfare Policies and Illegitimate Birth Rates Among Adolescents: Analysis of State-by-State Data," <i>Social Work Research and Abstracts</i> 14 (1989), pp. 5-11.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	7. Recent research presented at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences by Mark Rosenzweig of the University of Pennsylvania showed a reduction in AFDC payments of $130 per month could lead to a 40 percent drop in out-of-wedlock births among low income women under age 22. Mark R. Rosenzweig, "Welfare, Marital Prospects and Nonmarital Childbearing," December 1995.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	8. Another recent study finds large effects of welfare on illegitimacy. A 20 percent increase in welfare benefit levels across all states would increase the probability of teen out-of-wedlock births by as much as 16 percent. (However, the authors state that these findings should be treated cautiously because they were not proven to be statistically significant.)

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	12. A study by Scott South and Kim Lloyd finds a positive relationship between welfare and the percentage of births which are out-of-wedlock. Scott J. South and Kim M. Lloyd, "Marriage Markets and Non-Marital Fertility in the United States," <i>Demography</i>, May 1992, pp. 247-264.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	13. A recent study by Phillip Robins and Paul Fronton finds that higher welfare benefits lead to more births among never-married women. Phillip K Robins and Paul Fronton, "Welfare Benefits and Family Size Decisions of Never-Married Women," <i>Institute for Research on Poverty: Discussion Paper</i>, DP #1022-93, September 1993.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	14. A recent Rand Corporation study finds higher welfare benefits increase illegitimate births. Catherine A. Jackson and Jacob Alex Klerman, "Welfare, Abortion and Teenage Fertility," RAND research paper, August 1994.

	

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The following five studies found no relationship between higher welfare benefits and illegitimacy. Significantly, no study has ever found that welfare has a positive effect in reducing illegitimacy and promoting marriage.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Gregory Acs, "The Impact of AFDC on Young Women's Childbearing Decisions," Institute for Research on Poverty, Discussion Paper # 1011-93. This study finds a small relationship between higher welfare benefits and total births to white women, but no significant relationship between welfare and illegitimate births. The study does, however, show that being raised in a single-parent home doubles the probability that a young woman will have a child out of wedlock.

<li>         The impact of increasing the lenience and generosity of welfare in undermining work and prolonging dependence has been confirmed by controlled scientific experiment. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."  Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80. The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs: Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment. See: Gregory B. Christiansen and Walter E. Williams, "Welfare Family Cohesiveness and Out of Wedlock Births," in Joseph Peden and Fred Glahe, <i>The American Family and the State</i> (San Francisco: Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1986), p. 398.

For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.

<b>Essays by James Q. Wilson & Kathleen Sylvester call for an end to money for teen moms to live on their own</b>
<p> <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
March-April 1996, Number 76</i><hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sociologist James Q. Wilson proposes that unmarried, pregnant girls live in some type of supervised, privately run group home as a condition of receiving government benefits. This, he argues, would help provide the social structure that young single mothers and their children now lack, but desperately need if they are to escape the cycle of dependence. <a href="#syl">Kathleen Sylvester</a> of the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a> describes a version of this concept that was approved by Congress last fall as part of its welfare reform package. President Clinton vetoed the bill.<p><h3>James Q. Wilson<br><i>Beginning with Our Children</I></h3><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The American political regime as envisioned by its founders was not supposed to have anything to do with character. It was supposed to enable people living in villages and towns to compose their differences at the national level in order to secure a more perfect union and ensure domestic tranquillity and justice. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It was assumed that it was in private associations (family, neighborhood, and peer groups) and small political institutions (village and town governments) that character could be formed, so the national government could take character for granted. "Men," Madison wrote, "are presumed to have sufficient virtue to constitute and maintain a free republic." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Today, by contrast, we are properly concerned with the issue of character, placed on the national agenda by both political parties. Why is it that the assumptions that influenced the men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 are no longer the assumptions we bring to the contemplation of the true purpose of our national polity?<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One reason is that government has gotten bigger. As government gets bigger, it touches all aspects of our lives. As it touches all aspects of our lives, we increasingly put our concerns back on the government. The price of big government is an ever-expanding agenda. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Forty years ago, when I began studying politics, it was inconceivable that the federal government would ever be held responsible for crime, drug abuse, illegitimacy, welfare, civil rights, clean air, or clean water. Today it is responsible for all those things. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not only have our aspirations and the size of the federal government changed, but so has our culture. In many spheres of our lives, we are no longer confident that local private institutions like families, churches, and neighborhoods are sufficient to form a culture that will sustain and enrich a free society. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One of the areas in which this concern has become most sharply focused is illegitimacy. An illegitimacy crisis that affects both blacks and whites has been growing without let up since the early 1960s. It has shaped the profound debate now unfolding in Washington about the relationship between federal welfare programs and the very formation and maintenance of families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Title IV, which created the program now known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was added to the Social Security Act of 1935, it was the least controversial part of that landmark legislation. For years after its enactment, it caused scarcely a national political ripple. The reason was that it gave federal support to a few state programs designed to provide short-term compensation to women who had been widowed due to the First World War or coal-mining disasters, or who had been divorced or deserted by husbands. It nationalized these programs by extending them to the other states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one expected it would become a way of life and no one ever expected teenagers would apply for it. All that has changed. Today, the typical new AFDC enrollee spends only two or three years on welfare and then moves on. It acts as a stopgap measure to provide for the needs of women and children during a particularly difficult time in their lives. This is the group for whom AFDC was originally intended. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But if you look at the total number of welfare recipients, as opposed to those who enter the roles in any given year, you notice that the typical recipient has been on welfare for 10 years. Increasingly, this has extended into second and third generations. Many come and leave quickly, but a few remain. And the number who remain now constitute the largest share of the whole. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There is a spirited debate about why this should be so. I think it is fair to say that no one can confidently claim to know the answer to this question. It is difficult to sustain the argument that the existence of welfare causes dependency if it did not do so during the first 30 years of its history. Evidence about the effect of state differences in welfare payments on rates of welfare participation is inconclusive. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has probably been a profound cultural shift that has destigmatized illegitimacy and removed barriers that once inhibited people from remaining on AFDC for long periods of time. Even if we assume that the system of public payments did not cause this phenomenon, it certainly makes it possible. If the system did not exist, the current degree of dependency would not exist.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if you disagree with that assertion, the system has surely not cured its own defects. Rates of illegitimacy and single parenthood among black and white Americans have risen steadily since the early 1960s and that trend shows little sign of tapering off. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The harms associated with single parenthood and illegitimacy are now so well documented that the evidence need not be reviewed. But let me give you one example gathered by the government itself. A few years ago, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services selected more than 30,000 households across the country, designed to represent a statistical cross section. They interviewed the mother, father, or both about the welfare of their children. Except for the very highest income level, children raised in single-parent households are materially worse off, irrespective of race. They are worse off in terms of educational achievement, social well-being, aggressiveness, and difficulty with the law. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It should not take massive studies to establish this phenomenon. It is evident to many who confront life in hospital emergency rooms, police stations, juvenile courts, or welfare offices on a daily basis. The problem has crystallized in our concern about the unmarried teenage mother. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you survey the history of families around the world, every culture has had teenage mothers. Indeed, what is striking today is how long many women wait before having children. But what was different in the past is that those girls gave birth as part of an embedded structure: with a husband, parents, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and siblings. They were part of an extended family or a village in which there were many people who not only helped take care of the child, but taught the mother to be a mother and required that the father be a father. The debate I hear in Washington about reforming the current system is remarkably inattentive to the core fact that young girls living apart from other adults cannot expect much success at raising children alone. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead, the debate is posing questions such as: How do we save money on the welfare budget? How soon can we require recipients to work? How can we use modern technology to go after deadbeat dads? These may all be worthwhile concerns, but they should be viewed as subordinate to the central goal of saving the children whose lives are being destroyed as a consequence of growing up in this environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To solve this problem, we must ask all levels of government and the private sector to do something American government has never had to do before: constitute and support a viable alternative to the traditional family for the children and young women most at risk. One trembles even to utter the phrase "viable alternative," because in the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, the king with all his legions stops at the threshold of the hut of the very poorest peasant. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We all understand that government cannot raise children. But there is something out there that is not working and government must change its allocation of incentives to give us a fighting chance of solving the problem. Let me suggest a strategy and then indicate how it might be implemented. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We must get young, unmarried, pregnant girls embedded in a social structure under adult supervision. This not only provides their children with a chance for a good start in life, but teaches them how to be a parent and protect themselves from the desperate conditions of gangs, drugs, and crime that often exist around them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I therefore propose that if young, unmarried, pregnant women wish to establish an independent household at public expense, they should be given this support only on the condition that they live in some kind of family shelter or group home managed under private auspices, including religious groups. Part of the welfare reform debate currently raging in Washington focuses on the so-called Ashcroft Amendment, sponsored by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment states that nothing in the proposed welfare reform bill shall prevent religious groups from providing social services to welfare recipients on an equal basis with secular groups. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not clear what is meant by "services," or how funds would be transferred to these groups. But it is sending the message to young women that the character of the children they are raising is so important to this society that we insist they raise them in a truly adult setting provided by one of a variety of private organizations. And we will reinforce this by saying that your check cannot be cashed unless it is cosigned by the person who manages the program. You are free to choose the program -- secular or religious -- you wish to join. But we will not fund you to set up an independent household, given what we know about the harm it does to the children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Up to this point I have said nothing about the other half of the equation -- the men involved. The riskiest policy for a male observer is to act as if this were a problem created by women that could be solved by placing more constraints on women. But let me clarify a few points from the perspective of someone who has been researching the history of families and fatherhood around the world. Men and women differ in their willingness to make a commitment to the welfare of a child. This can be established by the simple fact that in any culture where there are single-parent families, more than 90 percent of them are headed by women. This cannot happen by accident. If it were simply a matter of cultural convention, you would find places where half or more of single parent families were headed by men. But you do not. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Men and women differ due to evolution, biology, and a variety of other factors. But since women care for children when men will not, much of civilization has been devoted to the problem of disciplining males. Society in all cultures has invented a few techniques to get males to play their role. When I was growing up, young unmarried women who got pregnant had a couple of choices. They either went away to live with relatives, had the child, then returned while the relatives raised the child, or they told their fathers and brothers the identity of the father of the child. The father and brothers then told the boy, "Either you marry the girl or we will beat you to death." The other option for the boy was to run away and join the Navy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; None of those options seems to work anymore. The force of custom and shame is no longer as powerful as it once was. The law once played a role in forcing men to take responsibility by requiring that paternity be clarified. Women once played a role by denying sexual access to men unwilling to make a commitment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you want to summarize in hyperbolic terms what the core problem of character formation is today, it is that the only one of these forces that still operates is the woman's willingness to say "no." In place of law, we have no-fault divorce. In place of custom and shame, we have created a sense that everyone should "do his own thing." And fathers and brothers, far from beating up someone who has impregnated a daughter without marrying her, are themselves busy with other people's daughters. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, this leaves the burden on women. But women should not bear the burden alone; the state should be on their side. To the extent it can, it is desirable for the state to enforce the obligations of paternity. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has proven to be extremely difficult. For several years, particularly since Congress passed the Family Support Act in 1988, programs have been in place to get states to devise ways of collecting child-support payments from absent fathers. Many states have vigorously pursued the fathers, but have not collected much money. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But again we are moving away from the core problem. The key is not to supply dollars, but to supply the father. It is his presence, not just his money, that has been lost. The average child raised by a mother only sees his father a few times a year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem of reconstituting this character-forming institution cannot be solved by government. But I would suggest that just as we have formed and are encouraging charter schools, we should form and encourage "charter families" --  private-sector groups that are willing to accept government money to provide long-term shelters for young girls who cannot or will not live with their own parents and who have children with no fathers to take care of them. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have no idea whether this will work. But we must encourage this type of experimentation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Money is going to flow from Washington to the states in the form of block grants. With some degree of restriction, states will have the opportunity to design and implement their own welfare programs. Most states will reproduce less expensive forms of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I hope the states will use this opportunity to tear up the old script. Leave the existing system intact for women who need it as a bridge to get through death, desertion, or divorce, and will leave welfare in two or three years. But provide a radically different option, privately run and with a built-in social structure, for those young girls who are now raising the next generation of our children. <P><I><b>James Q.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1863, President Lincoln signed a charter establishing a home for orphans and "unprotected females" --  as unwed mothers were then known -- just a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last September, during the Senate's contentious welfare-reform debate, there was a rare moment of bipartisan agreement as Senate Democrats were joined by Mr. Lincoln's party in nearly unanimous support of a similar institution: the "second-chance home." In an amendment later adopted by the House of Representatives, the U.S. Congress went on record in support of reviving an old institution -- the maternity home -- in a new form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home amendment, offered by Democratic Senators Kent Conrad and Joseph Lieberman, would provide $150 million in seed money for states to support community-based residences for welfare mothers under 18. Young women whose own families are unstable would be required to live under adult supervision in these homes with their children as a condition of receiving welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This provision was included in the welfare-reform bill vetoed by President Clinton. But the idea and its principles already are attracting broad support. States and communities are not waiting for federal funding. The "second-chance home" may become a new social institution. And even more importantly, it may offer a model for partnerships between government and communities that restore values to social programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason that second-chance homes are becoming popular is that they are practical. They are designed to deal with the realities of teen mothers' lives rather than the stereotype that they are simply promiscuous young women having babies to get welfare checks. Remember, these women have been badly nurtured. Many have been subjected to neglect or physical violence. Studies show that as many as two-thirds were victims of rape or sexual abuse at an early age-crimes often committed by males living in the same household. Many suffer from mental and emotional problems. They are easy prey for older men. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that almost two-thirds of teenage mothers' babies are fathered by men who are 20 or older.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the life prospects of teenage mothers are severely limited by their lack of socialization: They raise their children as their parents raised them; they model their social behavior after peers from the same neighborhoods. They have few role models for any other life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many of these young women, it will take a new home and a new family -- a second-chance home. Communities as varied as Los Angeles, New Albany, Indiana, and Wheeling, West Virginia, are offering such homes. There are several hundred of them around the country, mostly privately funded. While the homes differ in structure, they all offer three common elements that teen welfare mothers need to change their lives: socialization, nurturing and support, and structure and discipline.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These homes offer a genuine social contract. The young mothers must help with household duties, stay in school or job training, and take good care of their children. They must stay drug free and abide by curfews. They learn to manage money and manage conflicts. In return, they get help with day care and health care and schoolwork. They get protection from violent family members and abusive boyfriends. Most importantly, the teen mothers receive the support of caring adults and lessons in everyday living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The notion that government has a fundamental obligation to help these young mothers is one Democrats have long supported. But the idea these young women owe society a reciprocal obligation is one that some in the party have resisted. The welfare debate signaled a change: Many Democrats are ready to abandon the moral relativism that has characterized liberal social policy. While those on the party's far left still argue for an unfettered right to public support, a growing number of Democrats are willing to impose standards on welfare mothers, sending a powerful message that society no longer offers unconditional financial support for women who bear children out of wedlock. Senator Lieberman, in offering his amendment, called a system that supports the birth of children to young unwed mothers "profoundly troubling" and one that "does not reflect the best values of our country." Many Democrats, it seems, are ready to reassert the importance of values in social policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Republicans have traditionally been more comfortable talking about values, but less willing to acknowledge a basic government role in assuring the welfare of citizens in need. And to be sure, many conservative Republicans -- those who would cut off public aid to teen mothers under 18 -- still take the callous and wrongheaded view that the fundamental goal of welfare reform is to punish illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But Democrats and Republicans in a number of states -- including Massachusetts, Iowa, Maryland, and California -- are working together to create second-chance homes. If these political leaders are wise, they will continue on their bipartisan path: They will support the Democrats' assertion of a fundamental role for government in social problems, and they will heed the Republicans' insistence on the importance of values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whose values? The values of communities. If second-chance homes are created as real "community-based" institutions, they will begin to remedy one of the unintended consequences of the New Deal. For when government assumed primary responsibility for poor families, communities were relieved of obligations to care for their own citizens, and the notion of social reciprocity disappeared. Government became a wedge between communities and individuals, providing each group excuses to ignore its obligations to the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second-chance homes should not be "government-run" or purely government-funded. They should be run by community-based institutions, including churches and non-profit organizations. That is how the most effective homes for teen mothers are now run. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Teen Parent Residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, offers an example. The program, based in a cluster of low-income apartment units subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, costs the state just $67,500 for services to 14 teen mothers and their children for one year. The young mothers, who are enrolled in the federal Job Corps, use their welfare checks to pay below-market rent for the apartments they share. The state pays for an apartment in the cluster for the resident "house mother," for a night-duty nurse, and for some professional counseling services. Virtually everything else comes from the community.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The local health clinic teaches the young mothers about child development. The Agricultural Extension service teaches nutrition classes. Local youth groups offer baby-sitting services. Albuquerque's Hispano Chamber of Commerce not only donates money to the program, it hires the program's graduates. Families from local churches take the mothers and children home for Sunday dinner-and sometimes to Sunday services as well. The young women and children who live in the Teen Parent Residence have become part of the community. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is possible, of course, to spend much more money on residential facilities for young mothers. In New York state, group homes staffed and run entirely by professionals cost more than $50,000 a year per mother and child. While this approach guarantees uniform standards, it also guarantees that the young mothers will live in isolation from their communities. These expensive, bureaucratic institutions reinforce the old paternalistic notion of the left that government can invent a program to solve every problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home legislation takes an important step away from bureaucratic rigidity by specifying that beneficiaries of federal programs can't be discriminated against if they live in these group homes. This means, for example, that young mothers won't lose their food-stamp benefits if they cook and eat together -- something current food-stamp regulations prohibit. In practical terms, it means that a small community-based organization that wants to help four or five teen mothers won't have to apply for federal waivers so young women can keep their food-stamp income and use it to buy groceries for the home. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now as welfare decisions shift to state policymakers, they, too, must resist urges to overregulate and micromanange. Governors and legislators deciding how to set policies for second-chance homes should use these principles for guidelines:
<p><ul><li>	Funding should be used as Congress intended -- as seed money. It should go only to communities that pledge broad community involvement and a match of in-kind services.<p>
<li>	Churches and other religiously affiliated institutions have a long history of service to families; these organizations should be eligible for public funding to continue providing services.<p>
<li>	Evaluate them on what they accomplish. Judge the homes by the number of mothers who don't get pregnant a second time, the number who finish school, and the number who get off welfare. This would allow providers to help teen mothers by whatever means work. <p>
<li>	Government's monopoly over social policy is quickly eroding. In response to this change, government must offer communities a new "bargain." Government must catalyze and support the efforts of communities. At the same time, government policy should be consistent with a declaration by our nation's civic, moral, and community leaders that it is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they cannot support. In this way, government can help reestablish the importance of values -- those of communities and families -- in social policy. That is the best way to define a social agenda for the next century.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;St. Ann's, the institution that Lincoln chartered, still operates today just outside of Washington, D.C. And though the lives of its residents are vastly different from its first beneficiaries, they still meet Lincoln's definition of "unprotected females." They are still young women who need society's support to make decent lives for their children. Politicians of both parties who revere Lincoln should heed his wisdom.<p><I><b>Kathleen Sylvester</b> is the vice president for domestic policy at the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>.</I>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Over the past few decades, government welfare programs have 
been designed to lift the burden of caring for the poor from ordinary people, by allowing them to write a 
check to pay the professionals who would solve problems. It is time for government to reassert a healthy 
pressure on the American people: Congress should phase out federal-assistance programs and push states to 
develop ways for individuals and community-based groups to take over poverty-fighting responsibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our predecessors understood the Constitutions charge to 
provide for the common defense but to promote the general welfare -- by ensuring an environment within 
which individual and community action could flourish. When, for example, Congress in 1854 passed a bill 
for federal construction and maintenance of mental hospitals, President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill. 
Should this bill become law, that Congress is to make provision for such objects, the foundations of 
charity will be dried up at home, he said.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pierce's veto was sustained. His concern about dried up 
charity was typical of the era: Municipal aid to the poor could dry up private charity; state relief could dry 
up city aid; federal programs could dry up state efforts. Hardly the way to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the mood of that era -- not to mention the Constitutional 
vision for addressing social needs -- has been lost. The concept of the modern welfare state placed 
responsibility for fighting poverty not at the lowest level but the highest. National entitlement programs 
came to dominate the social-services scene. The reversal of Pierces doctrine was so complete that even 
conservatives in the 1980s, who favored reducing the growth of welfare programs, still talked of the 
importance of maintaining a federal safety net. They did not understand that the federal safety net was not 
only inefficient, but conceptually mistaken.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>What?</I> Criticize the safety net itself? Yes. When I took 
my children to the circus recently, I realized how infrequently the Ringling Brothers safety net is used. For 
an acrobat, a fall to the safety net is a failure; if he falls stunt after stunt, he will be fired. Most people 
during the Depression had the psychology of the acrobat: The newly installed federal safety net was to be 
used only when the choice was between it and a hole in the ground. But over time, as attitudes softened and 
welfare programs expanded, that desire to avoid using the safety net was often lost. The destigmatizing of 
welfare in the 1960s meant that the acrobats no longer needed to strain for those extra inches, because the 
audience would still applaud even if they fell into the safety net every time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What America needs is not a safety net but a vast variety of 
small trampolines, suited to individual needs, movable so as to be present for individual crises, and 
providing a level of bounce fitted to the skill level and psychology of the individuals they are designed to 
save. Governments role under such a plan is clear: Get rid of constraints on the construction and 
movement of trampolines, and -- if it does not appear that enough trampolines will be produced -- provided 
incentives to get more. In that way, government can promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What would this mean in terms of practical policy? Nothing 
short of a revolutionary proposal: We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions about welfare 
and the financing of it, and then press them to put welfare entirely in the hands of church- and community-
based organizations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Under this radically decentralist proposal, Congress would 
acknowledge that even the block-grant concept violates common sense -- far better to leave the money in 
the states in the first place. Congress would acknowledge that block grants reduce accountability, for the 
goal of block grants is to free state governments from centralized control, but it also tends to free them 
from taxpayer control because the funds are viewed as free money blown in from Washington. Congress 
would acknowledge that block grants tend to breed scandal; without real accountability to either the 
national capital or the states citizenry, funds are wasted and pressure mounts for Congress to attach not 
just strings but ropes to hold the sides of the box together.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In this scenario, a bold Congress, pushed hard by the 
newcomers of 1994 and 1996, would not fall into the same old trap and recentralize. Instead, Congress 
would pass, effective at the end of the block-grant era, a massive tax cut, with federal taxes decreasing by 
the amount no longer block-granted. (A side benefit: If Congress moves toward a flat tax, the tax rate could 
be set lower than is currently anticipated.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would then use their own taxing authorities to implement 
new programs, or duplicate the old ones if they choose to do so. If a new Congress were to make that 
decision in 1997, states would have four years to plan for the post-federal welfare era. They could tax 
residents adequate amounts to care for the poor, but provide incentives for citizens to contribute sizable 
amounts of time or money to local poverty-fighting charities by providing exemptions to the new tax.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not as if a dollar-for-dollar replacement for the $350 billion 
annual cost (in 1994) of federal and state welfare spending (70 percent of it coming from Washington) is 
necessary: We know that much money is wasted and worse than wasted, actually causes harm. Yet, if more 
trampolines are needed, we should not be opposed theoretically to governments, once they have worked to 
reduce barriers, also working to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way for legislatures to do this would be to offer the 
average taxpayer a deal as follows: Come the year 2001, under the Welfare Replacement Act of 1997, 
your federal tax burden will be reduced by an average of $3,000. We certainly do not want to be accused of 
being cruel or mean-spirited, so we will raise state taxes by an average of $2,500. However, we also want 
to promote personal involvement with community-based organizations that offer effective compassion to 
the poor, and if you provide to such an organization a combination of money and time totaling at least 
$3,000 -- thus leaving the quantity of societal commitment to the poor unchanged -- you will be exempt 
from the new tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This would obviously represent a sweeping change from the 
current system. Now, taxpayers who itemize can deduct from their taxable income the contributions they 
make to a wide range of religious, charitable, and educational organizations, at their marginal tax rate (the 
lowest is 15 percent, the highest is 39.6 percent). This is helpful, but not good enough, and movement 
toward a flat tax might eliminate that deduction anyway. Under the new system proposed here, states 
would push taxpayers in a massive way to become involved with groups that provide direct social services 
to the poor, and offer exemption from taxation for such purposes to those who were helping others in their 
own way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At least 11 critical questions about such a revolutionary 
departure from current practice immediately arise:
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What percentage of taxpayers would choose to support local 
charities and thereby gain exemption?</I></b> That is very difficult to predict, but with four years of 
preparation it is likely that many would, resulting in a tremendous boost to nonprofit finances and a large 
increase of citizen involvement. Those who did not become involved would pay the new tax, and states 
could use that fund to pay for any missing trampolines.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would church-based and community-based organizations be 
ready to expand or replicate themselves in order to make use of their new resources in a new 
century?</I></b> They would have time to prepare, and the encouragement of a new system would blow 
away the compassion fatigue that has built up over the years. 
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would acceptance of exemption-creating contributions force 
poverty-fighting charities to accept governmental control?</I></b> At the moment, charitable 
organizations that seek government grants come under government oversight; some church-related 
programs have gained financially but lost their souls in the process. Even nonreligious charities accepting 
public funds have been forced to treat all of their clients bureaucratically, within the parameters set by law 
and regulation, rather than dealing with each human being on an individual basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The advent of new tax exemptions would not automatically 
free up religious groups and other community-based institutions to participate as equals in the social 
services sector. Despite precedents set by the GI Bill and other programs that allowed consumer choice, the 
ACLU would not be amused by the removal of secular liberalism from its established, privileged place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, the offer of an exemption (signifying a right not to pay 
because of other services rendered) is as clear a hands-off statement as a legislature can make. Exemptions 
offer a greater degree of protection than deductions, credits, or especially vouchers, since the latter requires 
government not only to overlook revenue but to send out checks. A political coalition strong enough to 
obtain tax exemptions should be strong enough to keep them from being abused by antireligious zealots.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldnt some exemptions from taxation go for funds sent to 
phony, needless, or simply ineffective projects? Wouldnt these cases be cited by partisans of the 
welfare state as reasons for opposing the exemption system?</I></b> Certainly, and those cases would 
make an impact on people who are startled to find that some among their fellow human beings are foolish, 
incompetent, or gullible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Markets work not because everyone exercises perfect 
judgment, but because, on balance, most people make good judgments most of the time. Even with all the 
anticipated human error, a charitable sector in which the funds are allocated by individual private decisions 
is likely to be less wasteful than the current system. Besides, with more resources at stake, more careful 
analysis of charitable effectiveness is likely to become common. Publications that examine charities the 
way a Consumer Reports examines products would emerge.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldnt acceptance of volunteer time as part of the 
exemption-creating contribution open the door to fraud?</I></b> It is true that proof regarding the 
giving of money tends to be clearer than that concerning time, the valuation of which can be complicated. 
Still, emphasis on the crucial meaning of compassion -- suffering with -- is vital, and a plan that provides 
incentives for contribution of money but not time is incomplete.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many groups already keep records of volunteer hours, so 
bookkeeping would not be an insurmountable problem. Corruption could be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the general credit for exemption purposes at the level of the minimum wage -- enough to provide a bit of 
compensation for work time lost and to signify societal commitment to compassionate action, but not 
enough to promote widespread cheating.
<P>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What would happen to health care for the poor?</I></b> 
Medicaid is the single biggest element of current federal and state welfare expense; of the $324 billion that 
federal and state agencies spent on welfare in 1993, $132 billion went for that one program. And yet, many 
cities have free or sharply-reduced-price clinics where some dedicated doctors and nurses volunteer their 
time. What can governments do to help such organizations?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Jackson, Mississippi, the Voice of Calvary Family Health 
Center sees about 8,000 patients each year, and would like to expand its operations or start other clinics 
like it. Center director Lee Harper contrasts her clinic with higher-budgeted state operations and concludes, 
When you have more money, you tend to waste more. Still, she needs more funds. Job one, however, is 
getting more hours from volunteer doctors, dentists, and nurses. If we get the health professionals, well 
get the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such an urgent need translates into a specific proposal that 
could be implemented at the federal level in lieu of all the macro-reform proposals of the 1990s: Give 
medical professionals tax credits for hours regularly worked at clinics. If a typical doctor, dentist, or nurse 
worked one day every two weeks at a clinic or in a similar way spent time to provide health care to poor 
individuals, billions of dollars in medical expenses could be saved. Participating health personnel, in 
return, could receive a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of their salaries. Such a credit could be the 
cornerstone of the personal alternative to bureaucratic health-care plans that are rightly regarded with 
skepticism.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why substitute a state tax (with exemptions) for a federal 
one? Why not simply reduce taxes and allow individuals to spend the money as they see fit?</I></b> 
Advocates of individual rather than governmental responsibility have the personal emphasis right, but will 
a reliance merely on individual goodwill and effort lead to the production of enough trampolines? For 
those who emphasize original sin rather than natural goodness, there is a middle ground between 
government and individual: Call it societal responsibility, within which government requires payment but 
leaves to the individual taxpayer how the money shall be spent.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Will it be possible to restrict tax-exempting contributions to 
those organizations that are actually engaged in fighting poverty and its associated 
pathologies?</I></b> In some cases the correct category will be obvious, but in others careful judgment 
will be required. For example, it would seem that general donations to a college or a private school should 
not be used for exemption purposes, but donations to a college or school scholarship fund for poor students 
should be. General donations to a church should not produce an exemption, but those to the churchs 
specific poverty-fighting endeavors (an anti-addiction program for example) should be. General donations 
to a hospital should not; donations to a free or reduced-rate clinic for the poor should.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such categorization would be necessary, even though it could 
cut into the individual flexibility that straightforward tax reduction would allow. No matter how carefully 
state legislatures define the new tax category for poverty-fighting organizations, officials would have to 
write and apply regulations implementing the new tax. That authority potentially could allow a state 
agency to exclude organizations that it did not favor for ideological, theological, or political reasons. Some 
organizations might change what they do and the way they do it in order to conform to the regulatory 
standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a threat does not mean that the new system could not 
work. It does mean that eternal vigilance will continue to be the price of liberty.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why not rely on pure voluntarism to do what is 
necessary?</I></b> The seeds of welfare replacement are already planted; if we wish to move quickly 
enough to save a generation of children during the first decade of the 21st century, those seeds need lots of 
water. If men were angels, no incentives for goodness would be necessary, but devolution to the states and 
further devolution through an exemption system is a good way for human beings to shift resources from 
the public sector to the private sector. Such a shift would provide a pool of capital for worthy charities to 
use in replicating themselves and thus replacing the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stimulation of voluntarism through tax exemption is an 
impure tactic, but our predecessors in this country, with their realistic view of human nature, were not 
above using impure motives to promote virtue. Colonial settlers who took in a poor person received 
compensation from the township, and some of them may occasionally have profited a bit (although that 
would be more than made up for by the time they spent mentoring the needy person). A farm family that 
adopted an orphan gained a farm hand, though the economic advantage was outweighed by the hard task of 
being new parents to someone who had grown up under tough conditions.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why require $3,000 to receive the exemption from payment 
of $2,500?</I></b> If some people hesitate to give (in money or minimum-wage time) the greater amount 
necessary to receive an exemption, that is fine; the quality of their giving would probably be low. Some 
personal contribution by the taxpayer is important to build a sense of involvement with and responsibility 
for the work of the charitable organization. The goal is to have as many taxpayers as possible think through 
their giving, and not merely respond to direct-mail appeals.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why would taxpayers be expected to make better decisions on 
groups to support than government officials have?</I></b> Competition has made the American 
economy the strongest in the history of humanity, and the American political system the envy of the world. 
The American people have proven themselves capable, on average and over the long haul, of making good 
economic and political judgments. Taxpayers who invested $500 of their own money and time in order to 
direct $2,500 to satisfying projects would be likely to make equally good judgments in the charitable 
sphere.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Decisions about where funds shall go would no longer be a 
function of political struggles over the budgets of government agencies, but would result from the 
decisions of millions of individual donors. Independent charitable organizations would for the first time in 
generations be on a level playing field with those groups favored by government. Some errors would 
occur, but there is every reason to expect this system of delivering assistance to the needy to be far more 
effective than the current model of top-down government monopoly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yes, some innovators would fail, but isnt it better to win a 
football game 50-14 than to play so defensively as to fall into a 3-3 tie? Given the growing number of 
damaged children and ruined adults under our current regime, isnt it better to take the rational risks that 
could liberate millions, rather than suffer constant winter without Christmas?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, decentralization offers the best shot for each state to 
innovate in the way that is right for its unique population and specific problems. Since we do not know 
precisely which legislative plan would best promote the offering of individual compassion, an emphasis on 
state-level action maximizes the opportunity to find out for sure which tactics work best. Furthermore, 
there may be greater opportunity to move quickly in some states than in Washington.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each state would have to sort out its particular 
problems, all must face, for example, rising rates of illegitimacy. Abstinence programs are a start. When 
pregnancy nevertheless results and marriage does not, states should foster group-living arrangements for 
women while pregnant and during the year or two afterwards, so that those who would otherwise be alone 
will have a support network. States should challenge biases against adoption, and stress the advantages to 
the child of adoption at birth (or up to age two, at the latest). Having a baby out of wedlock should not 
bring with it the reward of any governmental cash payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No public-policy measure can take the place of the personal 
changes that are necessary to raise high the standard of American compassion. With supportive laws and 
rules compassionate individuals can make real progress toward reducing some of our most serious social 
pathologies, but the crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual soul, not in the federal or 
state capitols.

<H2>Charities on the Dole</h2>

<b>by Kimberly Dennis</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Those who expect Americas charities to replace government as a 
provider of social welfare ought to look a little closer. They will find that the so-called independent sector, 
which receives between one-quarter and one-third of its funds from taxpayers, isnt so independent after 
all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, many social-service agencies actually receive most of their 
funding from government. Save the Children owes 60 percent of its budget to the generosity of taxpayers, 
Catholic Charities 65 percent, CARE 78 percent, and the United Cerebral Palsy Association more than 80 
percent. Topping this list is the inaptly named Volunteers of America, which receives 96 percent of its $51-
million budget from government sources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal government now channels $39 billion a year in grant 
money through nonprofits. New Yorks social-service economy employs more people than Wall Street. 
Private social-service agencies actually represent the city governments largest group of vendors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The governmentnonprofit complex doesnt just consume taxpayer 
money. It uses that money to lobby for government programs that would consume even more taxpayer dollars. Congressmen <a href="http://www.house.gov/istook/welcome.html">Ernest Istook</a> and David McIntosh have drawn widespread attention to this problem through their efforts to limit federal  
financing for nonprofits that engage in political advocacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We now know that the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which must share some of the blame for our teetering Social Security system, received $74 million in 
government funds in 1994. The Environmental Defense Fund, an advocate of stringent business regulation, 
got $500,000 in government support. The National Council of Senior Citizens, which received $71 million 
courtesy of taxpayers, recently spent much of its energy lobbying Congress on behalf of President 
Clintons health-care proposals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tax-funded nonprofits also compete with the very profitmaking 
businesses whose taxes support them. In Pennsylvania, a nonprofit hospital that receives government funds 
operates a marina. In New York, government-funded housing competes with private development, and 
homeless shelters crowd out cheap single-room-occupancy residences. In our nations capital, George 
Washington University, a nonprofit institution that receives public funds, operates a hotel and a restaurant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nonprofits that compete with businesses to provide of goods and 
services take advantage of tax exemption in many ways. In 1993, the Childrens Television Workshop 
received $22.5 million in tax-free royalties from the sale of Sesame Street products. A Sesame Street store 
just opened in an Indianapolis mall; one can only wonder how the owners of the toy shop a few doors away 
feel about losing business to a store that generates tax-free revenues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The independent sectors natural affinities should lie with the business 
sector. After all, its vitality depends on the wealth business creates. But as more and more support for 
nonprofits is channeled through government, the independent sectors allegiances have shifted to Capitol 
Hill and the federal bureaucracy. It is not just that these institutions think their well-being (and hence 
societys) depends on a generous government. They also view for-profit ventures as second-rate, morally 
inferior, and perhaps even evil. Theyd rather see people eat in a soup kitchen than in a diner, live in a 
habitat for humanity than in a trailer park.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are, of course, many small, innovative, and values-driven grass-
roots charities that are addressing human needs much more efficiently than failed federal programs and 
social-service agencies. These groups mostly avoid government money, because they know that 
government support comes with strings attached.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These strings involve more than just paperwork and regulations. 
Government support also changes charities incentives, giving them reasons to keep caseloads up instead of 
getting them down by successfully turning around peoples lives. It distorts their missions. It turns lean, 
cost-effective organizations into bloated bureaucracies, and dilutes their spiritual or religious message. In 
instances where the Salvation Army decided to accept government funds (which constitute about 15 
percent of its revenues), it stopped requiring church attendance as a condition of its assistance. 
Unfortunately, this experience is all too common. The charity that stays genuinely independent from 
government is still the exception.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although charities are supposed to offer an alternative to government 
provision of social welfare, they have become so dependent upon and aligned with government that they 
no longer represent a way out of the welfare state. If we place our faith in private nonprofits as they are 
currently organized, we are in for a big disappointment. Before we can rely on charities to help us 
dismantle government, they must wean themselves off the dole.

<h2>Block (Grant) Party</h2> 
<P>

<B>by <a href="http://badger.state.wi.us:/agencies/gov/gov_home.html">Tommy Thompson</a></B>
<P>
 What will the states do differently once they have block grants?
The short and simple answer: We will put our ideas to work. Once
a block-grant system becomes operational, several key areas of
public assistance will be set loose from the dead weight of federal
oversight.<p>
 For the most part, the block-grant system frees states
from the shackles of a waiver system that has inhibited innovation
and stymied true reform. Prior to recent congressional action,
if a state passed an innovative welfare reform initiative, it
would have to go to Washington on bended knee and kiss somebody's
ring in order to get a waiver to implement the program.<p>
 In Wisconsin,
we know the waiver system all too well. We have sought and received
227 different waivers to implement our innovative welfare programs.
And we know that you never get everything you ask for in a waiver
request, either. If your waiver asks for 10 items, you are lucky
if Washington grants you three.<p>
 In Wisconsin, the block-grant
system means we will be able to implement the most ambitious change
in the welfare system that this country has ever seen.  <p>
The changes
we expect to enact are called W-2, or Wisconsin Works. This initiative
would end the automatic welfare check. It would end AFDC. And
once implemented, W-2 will mark the greatest change in social
policy in this country in the past 50 years. <p>
In Wisconsin, we
will no longer have a welfare system; we will have a work system.
In fact, we have already transferred our welfare division from
our Department of Health and Human Services to our Department
of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations, and have made it a work
division. The reason: We are replacing the automatic welfare check
with a comprehensive package of work options, job training, health-care
and child-care services, and even financial planning.  <p>
And we
know W-2 will succeed in moving people off welfare and into the
workforce. Wisconsin has been reforming the welfare system longer
than any other state by far, having begun when I took office in
1987. Since then, our AFDC caseload has dropped 30 percent, and
we're saving our taxpayers $17 million a month.  <p>
Imagine what
Wisconsin and other states could do with the freedom and flexibility
provided by the block-grant system. <p>
In a recent study, Princeton
University professor Lawrence Mead concluded that Wisconsin cut
its welfare dependency because it tied benefits to work. W-2 is
based on the philosophy that for those who can work, only work
should pay. We assume that everybody is able to work-or at least
is able to contribute to society through some work activity within
their abilities. The only way to escape welfare or to escape poverty
is to work. There is no other way. Therefore, W-2 helps the traditional
welfare recipient make the transition to employment and an independent
life as quickly as possible. When people seek economic assistance
(or what used to be known as AFDC) from the state, they will be
required to sign up for work immediately. And it is only by performing
some level of work that they will receive economic assistance.<p>

W-2 consists of a four-rung job ladder designed to help participants
climb out of poverty and government dependence and into a life
of independence and self-reliance. The top rung is unsubsidized
employment. Under this option, participants who are job-ready
will be matched up with the best available job. This is the ideal
option-the rung on the ladder that all participants should aspire
to reach. A W-2 participant directed into unsubsidized work is
also eligible for, depending on his income, food stamps, health
care, child care, and the earned-income tax credit. <p>
The second
rung on the ladder is subsidized employment, or trial jobs. This
rung is for people without a work history but with a willing attitude.
Employers who hire people on this rung get help in offsetting
some of the costs of training and trying out a new employee. The
wage subsidy is limited to between three and six months. A person
in a trial job can remain on this rung of the ladder for no more
than 24 months and is eligible for food stamps, child care, health
care, and the earned- income tax credit. <p>
Community-service jobs
constitute the third rung and are meant for people who need to
practice the work habits and skills necessary to be hired by a
private business. These jobs will pay 75 percent of the minimum
wage (more than the welfare grant) and may come with food stamps,
child care, and health care. A person can remain in a community-service
job for up to nine months before being required to move up the
ladder, and there is a lifetime limit of 24 months for this rung.<p>

The fourth option, and bottom rung of the ladder, is called W-2
Transitions. This rung is reserved for those who legitimately
are unable to perform self-sustaining work, even in a community-service
job. To receive cash benefits, participants will work in activities
consistent with their abilities. Work at this level pays 70 percent
of minimum wage, and the worker is eligible for food stamps, health
care, and day care. Although this option has a 24-month participation
limit, extensions are permitted on a case-by-case basis. <p>
The goal
of this program is to move those with little or no work histories
up the work ladder, gaining more work experience, until they are
in an unsubsidized job and caring for their families on their
own. Participation is limited to five years over a person's lifetime.<p>

The benchmark for W-2's fairness is a comparison with low-income
families that work for a living. With this in mind, the program
includes a system of copayments for health-care and child-care
benefits. Just as low-income families must pay for child care
and health care-either in full or in part-W-2 participants will
be required to pay what they can afford for these services, on
a sliding scale. W-2 also would make health care more accessible
to low-income working families by allowing them to buy into the
state health-care system. <p>
Finally, Wisconsin Works is designed
to address the problem of teen pregnancy. In the past, too many
long-time welfare recipients started on welfare as teen parents.
We have to break the cycle of dependency earlier. So under our
plan, teen parents who are minors and who cannot live at home
or with a legal guardian will not be allowed to set up their own
household with cash assistance from the state. For those who cannot
live at home, three options will be available: Live in a foster
home, live in a group home, or, as a last resort for older teens,
live in a supervised independent setting.  <p>
The Wisconsin Works
welfare package has received bipartisan support in our legislature,
which is expected to approve the program early next year; we plan
to implement it in 1997. Without block grants, however, we would
need a series of waivers and probably would be unable to adopt
half of the program's initiatives. <p>
Another area that holds tremendous
promise for innovation under a block-grant system is Medicaid.
No item affects state budgets more profoundly than Medicaid, so
states will be looking for the most efficient and effective way
to provide high-quality health care at a reasonable cost. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we started improving our Medicaid system some time ago, but again
had to rely on a waiver system that scuttled some of our plans.
Regardless, industry experts have recognized Wisconsin for running
the country's most efficient Medicaid system. <p>
We began our reform
efforts using a managed-care system, which has allowed us to provide
more Medicaid recipients with a higher quality of care at lower
cost. Indeed, by enrolling AFDC recipients in health-maintenance
organizations, the state became an active player in controlling
costs. Instead of serving as a blank check, the state could step
in and negotiate the highest quality care at the best price. Instead
of serving as a health-care &quot;payor,&quot; the state is now
a health-care &quot;buyer.&quot; <p>
What is most exciting about the
program is that HMOs are providing AFDC recipients with better
health care. They have a primary doctor, someone they can go to
on a regular basis. They also have greater access to important
preventive care, such as well-baby visits and immunizations. <p>
While
Wisconsin is not alone in utilizing a managed-care system for
Medicaid recipients, the block-grant system will make it easier
for all states to shift to such a system.  <p>
As major buyers of
managed care, states will be able to leverage their purchasing
power to control costs as well as improve access and quality.
With the financial flexibility of block grants, many states also
will be able to extend this formidable purchasing power to offer
low-cost coverage to uninsured working families. Though managed
care, particularly for the elderly and disabled, requires careful
planning and vigilant oversight, it will be an essential component
of every new Medicaid program. <p>
States throughout this country
have been extraordinarily successful in enrolling nearly one-third
of all Medicaid recipients in managed-care organizations. But
progress has been frustrated by lengthy, time-consuming waivers
for arcane federal rules designed to impede managed care. In effect,
the current waiver process gives states a Hobson's choice: Either
accept the costly and burdensome new strings often attached to
federal waivers, or forgo altogether the use of managed care and
other modern delivery systems now common in the private sector.<p>

Besides managed care, the Medicaid block-grant system would allow
states to pursue integrated solutions in providing health care,
particularly long-term care for the elderly. <p>
Comprehensive service
networks are being created by the private sector from the inevitable
integration of health-care suppliers, particularly health plans,
hospitals, and clinics. While the federal government has been
oblivious to these historic changes, employers and other buyers
of health care are adapting to take full advantage. The block-grant
system will allow state Medicaid programs to take advantage as
well. <p>
Under the old Medicaid system, states were forced to take
a fragmented approach to health-care problems, most notably long-term
care. An incomprehensible layer of federal restrictions forced
states to create disparate programs in order to work around federal
obstacles. In the provision of long-term care, the result was
a confusing, overly complex and costly mix of home, community,
and institutional care. <p>
The new Medigrant program, however, will
permit states to integrate their long-term care programs and promote
the purchase of private long-term care insurance. By combining
the array of home, community, and institutional programs into
more integrated solutions based on managed care, the elderly and
disabled will have more options and taxpayers' costs will be better
controlled. Integrated solutions also provide states with greater
leverage to improve access to health care as well as the quality
of care. <p>
A third advantage to the block-grant system is that it
would allow states to make Medicaid coverage more sensible. As
an entitlement under federal law, the scope of Medicaid coverage
is now determined by the courts and rule-making bureaucrats. Neither
the medical community nor the taxpayers have any real say in the
matter. This has led to such absurdities as the coverage of gourmet
cookies, soap, and household appliances. This has long frustrated
the states as they've struggled to manage their systems. <p>
Freed
from federal oversight, we'll likely see the end to Medicaid as
the Cadillac of health plans and the eventual adoption of coverage
more akin to that offered to workers in private industry. While
coverage for the elderly and disabled will continue to include
additional services, particularly long-term care, the end of the
legal entitlement will permit states to take into account true
medical needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative services.<p>

Finally, the Medicaid block-grant system will lead to streamlined
administration, which will save taxpayer money. As a result of
an avalanche of federal mandates, Medicaid has become the most
complex social program ever devised. The Medicaid program is now
governed by more than 50,000 pages of federal-state agreements,
more than 2,000 pages of federal laws, and some 15,000 pages of
federal rules and instructions. This extraordinary level of complexity
makes the federal tax code look like a nursery rhyme. <p>
Furthermore,
states must collectively prepare more than 8,000 federally mandated
reports each year. Most of these are never read, much less used,
by a living soul. Because of the labyrinth of federal eligibility
rules, there are more than 200 different ways to qualify for Medicaid
in Wisconsin alone. Making matters worse, federal loopholes force
states to cover middle-class individuals and facilitate the hiding
of assets and income. <p>
Under the 170-page Medigrant bill, state
Medicaid plans could be vastly simplified, thousands of pages
of inane federal rules would be rescinded and those 8,000 reports
would be reduced to just 50-one for each state. States like Wisconsin
will be able to streamline eligibility determinations, close loopholes
and tie Medicaid coverage to participation in jobs programs like
W-2. And accountability will be enforced where it truly matters-in
the establishment of fiscal controls, independent audits and evaluations,
and public reporting of program performance. <p>
Medicaid will be
an area where states will clearly be able to demonstrate a greater
ability to manage an unwieldy program and provide services better
than Washington. And it will serve as an example of what can be
accomplished once Washington steps back and keeps its overregulating
fingers out of the mix. <p>
The block-grant system will provide states
with a remarkable opportunity to enact their best ideas and brightest
programs. The ultimate winner will be the taxpayer, who will receive
a higher quality product at a lower cost. Already, with the limited
amount of experimentation the federal government has allowed,
states have shown that they can manage complex programs like welfare
and Medicaid much better than the federal government. The very
concept of federal block grants shows that Congress is recognizing
the great work that is already being done by the states. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we can't wait to carry on that work and put our best ideas into
practice.

<h2>Humble Clovis Defies The Education Visigoths</h2>
<P>
<B>by Christopher Garcia</B>
<P>
 In 507 a.d., at Vouill&eacute; in present-day France, the King
of the Franks led a band of warriors against the Visigoths, the
marauding barbarians who had sacked Rome a century earlier. The
king, named Clovis, defeated the Visigoths and broke their hold
on Europe.<p>
 Today, a modern namesake-the Clovis Unified School
District (CUSD), in Fresno, California-is successfully defying
another ominous empire: the education establishment. Despite serving
a significant portion of Fresno's urban poor, Clovis is proving
that public schools can deliver a good education with a small
budget and minimal bureaucracy.<p>
 Clovis has long ignored the prevailing
cant about the need for high spending and huge bureaucratic machinery
to regulate public education. During the 1993-94 school year,
CUSD spent $3,892 per pupil; school districts nationwide averaged
$5,730. The district's student-to-administrator ratio is 520:1-nearly
twice the national average. And although similarly sized districts
(like those in Rochester, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin) typically
house 300 to 400 employees in their central offices, CUSD employs
just 167. With no teachers union or Parent Teachers Association
(PTA), CUSD is a rarity among public schools.  <p>
In this case, less
means more-more students performing above average across a broad
range of measures. The district's average score on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) is 52 points higher than the state average
and 42 points higher than the national average. CUSD's mean composite
score on the American College Test (ACT) stands respectably at
the 65th percentile. In 1995, with a senior cohort of 1,606, CUSD
students passed 720 Advanced Placement (AP) exams. <p>
Perhaps one
reason Clovis kids outperform their peers is that they show up
for class more often: The district's high-school attendance rate
is nearly 95 percent, and its drop-out rate is only 4 percent.
The district doesn't skimp on its extracurricular offerings, either.
More than 80 percent of Clovis students participate in one of
the most successful programs in California. Last year, the district
earned a championship at the National Future Farmers of America
Convention and sent its state-champion Odyssey of the Mind team
to compete in the world finals. <p>
Many Clovis children are among
the most disadvantaged in the region. Nearly 40 percent of the
district's students live in Fresno City. Six of CUSD's elementary
schools enroll enough AFDC children to qualify for direct financial
assistance from the federal government. And five schools have
student bodies with more than 50 percent minorities. In 1989,
the median household income of the community surrounding Pinedale
Elementary School was $10,000 below the national median of $28,906.
And yet Mexican-Americans, who make up the district's largest
minority (about 18 percent of all students), outperform their
state and national counterparts on the ACT by significant margins.<p>

Created in 1960 from the merger of seven rural, low-income school
districts, CUSD presented its first superintendent, Floyd V. Buchanan,
with a significant challenge: Barely more than one in three of
the district's 1,843 students performed at grade level. Buchanan
wanted to push this figure to 90 percent-but how? <p>
Put simply:
competition, control, and consequences. Buchanan reasoned that
schools would not be spurred to meet the goals that he and the
central administration set for them unless they competed against
one another in academic and extracurricular achievement. He established
goals for each of the system's 11 schools at the start of the
year, ranked them according to their performance at year's end,
and established a system of carrots and sticks (mostly carrots).<p>

Most importantly, administrators and teachers were allowed to
choose the teaching methods and curricula they felt suited their
objectives. This formula, in place for decades, has allowed the
district-now with 30 schools and 28,000 students-to place between
70 and 90 percent of its students at grade level. <p>
Competition
in the district exists at several levels. Earning a rating as
a top school is its own reward, but the district recognizes high
achievement in other ways. The top schools on the elementary,
intermediate, and high-school levels are recognized at an annual,
districtwide award ceremony. The district's best teachers and
administrators are honored at a dinner. And the school's achievements
are reported to parents and the community in the pages of the
district's publications.  <p>
The friendly, competitive culture at
Clovis clearly has helped drive achievement. Because a school's
performance at a districtwide choral competition or drama fair
influences its ratings, teachers, students, and administrators
work hard to give their routines the extra edge needed to push
ahead of their colleagues. Schools borrow the winning strategies
used elsewhere. Students at Clovis West High School, for example,
often score better on SATs and AP exams than those at Clovis High
School, so Clovis High has borrowed test-preparation tips from
Clovis West. Clovis High is also trying to improve discipline
by looking at successful techniques employed at Buchanan High.<p>

Competition, however, would produce little without local decision-making.
Anticipating trends that would revolutionize America's Fortune
500 companies, Buchanan made flexible, decentralized, site-based
management a fundamental feature of the school system in 1972.
The district office has been responsible for setting goals and
establishing guidelines, but schools have worked to meet these
goals in their own ways. &quot;They give us the what and we figure
out the how,&quot; says Kevin Peterson, the principal of Tarpey
Elementary School.<p>
When officials at Pinedale Elementary School
determined that parent participation there was lower than at other
schools, for example, they realized that immigrant parents felt
locked out by language barriers. So they created &quot;family
nights&quot; to help these parents take part in their children's
education. With their children present, the parents are taught
games and devices they can use at home to help their children
with their homework. The result: Immigrant parents now participate
more. Such innovation is easier in the absence of teacher unions.
For example, the district deploys teachers weekly to the homes
of about 100 recently arrived immigrants to provide them English-language
instruction and to help them build a bridge to their rapidly assimilating
children. Meredith Ekwall, a first-grade teacher at Weldon Elementary
School, teaches English at night to the parents of her ESL students
to encourage English use in the home. In districts where collective-bargaining
agreements stipulate precisely how much time teachers spend teaching,
micromanage the amount of time teachers can devote to activities
outside of the classroom, and dictate what a district can and
cannot ask its teachers to do, such flexibility and voluntarism
is rare.<p>
Along with teacher autonomy and greater parent access,
Clovis strives for accountability. All the teachers, without exception,
are expected to bring 90 percent of their students up to grade
level. If they do not, everyone knows about it. The district's
research and evaluation division notifies teachers, parents, and
administrators of school and student performance. And with curriculum
development and teacher hiring and firing in the schools' hands,
knowledge is power. The approach has &quot;made every teacher
accountable,&quot; says Redbank Elementary School Principal Susan
VanDoren. &quot;[I]t made me sit down and look at all those kids
[needing help] and ask, 'What can we do?'&quot; <p>
Parents seem more
likely to ask that question in Clovis than in other school districts.
Parents and other community members (including the clergy, senior
citizens, and businessmen) sit on advisory boards, where they
review individual school performance and formulate policy. Last
year, some parents were upset that children were required to read
feminist author Maya Angelou's <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</I>.
Parents forged an agreement with the district that allows them
to review books assigned to their children and help develop alternatives.
Other boards recently voted to institute a voluntary uniform and
a fee-based home-to-school transportation program. Teams of parents
issue critiques of schools on the basis of data culled from parent
surveys; these reviews are posted in every staff room in the district.<p>

These boards function the way PTAs are meant to, but without the
stifling hand of teacher-union influence. &quot;The reason for
the success of Clovis,&quot; says Superintendent Walter Buster,
&quot;is that these schools are truly governed by elected lay
people.&quot; <p>
Ultimately, it seems, success in CUSD is driven
by community expectations. &quot;There's a corporate culture that
has been established that requires more of people, expects of
people more, and gets of people more,&quot; says H.P. Spees, executive
director of Fresno-Madeira Youth for Christ and member of CUSD's
clergy advisory council. <p>
This culture of expectation is impressed
upon teachers even before they pick up a piece of chalk. A lengthy,
multi-tiered interview process incorporates parents, teachers,
community leaders, principals, and administrators and signals
to prospective teachers that the Clovis community demands much
of its teachers. According to Ginger Thomas, the principal of
Temprance-Kutner Elementary School, some teacher candidates quit
the interview process, saying &quot;you guys work too hard.&quot;
Assistant superintendent Jon Sharpe contends that Clovis sustains
&quot;a work ethic in the public sector that's almost unsurpassed.&quot;
He may be right: In 1992, CUSD teachers even voted down their
own pay raise to channel the money into books and supplies. <p>
In
an education system under assault for its academic failures, Clovis
has produced a winning formula. CUSD schools have won recognition
by the state of California 15 times and earned national blue ribbons
from the U.S. Department of Education 13 times. The prestigious
Phi Delta Kappa Center for Evaluation, Development, and Research
has featured Clovis in two works, <I>Clovis California Schools:
A Measure of Excellence</I> and <I>Total Quality Education</I>.
Even outspoken critics of public education recognize the district's
accomplishments. &quot;If we are going to limit ourselves to the
Prussian system of education, Clovis is the best we are going
to get in a tax-financed school,&quot; says Marshall Fritz, the
founder of the Fresno-based Separation of School and State Alliance
and the father of four Clovis students. <p>
Awards aside, the real
lesson of Clovis is that good education depends not on bloated
budgets but on creative and committed teachers and administrators
held accountable by engaged communities. Clovis's success also
suggests that quality in public education will not be the norm
until resources are channeled to classrooms rather than bureaucrats,
and parents wrest control over education from teachers unions.

Michigan had no public-school teacher strikes
this past September, compared with 11 in 1991 and three in 1994.
Under legislation signed last March by Governor John Engler, school
teachers are now fined a day's pay for each day they strike and
school districts may no longer make up any losses by assigning
strikers additional teaching days at the end of the school year.

Montana earned $13 million from timber harvests on state-owned
forest land from 1988 to 1992. During the same period, while cutting
down 12 times as many trees, the U.S. Forest Service lost $42
million in its Montana properties. Don Leal of the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC) says Montana outperformed the Feds by engaging
in better reforestation practices, spacing trees further apart
so that each tree receives more water and nutrients, and by using
less than one-third the staff to prepare timber sales. <p>
Since Cincinnati,

Jersey City, New
Jersey, saves $20,000 a year by offering its management employees

eligible, 97 have chosen them since their introduction last March.
Mayor Bret Schundler hopes to extend the MSA option to other city

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This is untrue.
<p><ul>
<li> The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.
<p>
<li> When past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is an astonishing 13 years.
<p>
<li> Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than three quarters will spend over five years on AFDC.
</ul><p>
The current liberal system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, "poverty" is harmful for children, and welfare, by allegedly reducing poverty, will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not assist children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastatingly negative effect on children's development. It is welfare dependence, rather than poverty, which has the most negative effect on children.
<P><ul>
<li> Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. 
<p>
<li> Welfare receipt as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower will be the boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income. 
<p>
<li> Receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
</ul><p>	
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult. 
<p>
The House and Senate will soon pass welfare reform legislation based on three key principles: 
<p>
1)  Reducing the growth of illegitimacy; 
<p>
2)  Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and 
<p>
3)  Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending. 
<p>
The public strongly supports the key provisions of the congressional reforms. According to recent polls:
<p><ul>
<li> By a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent, Americans support a "family cap."  Eighty-four percent "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."
<p>
<li> Three out of four Americans believe welfare encourages illegitimacy. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
<li> Still, nine out of ten Americans feel that welfare recipients should have "to work for their benefits."  However, they feel overwhelmingly that work requirements should be imposed on welfare mothers with older children before they are imposed on mothers with pre-school children.
</ul><p>


<b>THE PATTERN OF DEPENDENCE: LENGTH OF TIME ON WELFARE</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. According to this picture, AFDC generally provides temporary aid, and very few recipients receive welfare for extended periods. This picture is inaccurate. 
<p>
Of the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, most will be dependent on welfare for very long periods of time. As Chart 1 shows, families receiving AFDC at the present time have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years enrolled in AFDC.<sup>1</sup>  When past receipt and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC among those families currently receiving AFDC benefits is an astounding 13 years.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, these figures actually underestimate the length of welfare dependence, since such families are very likely to receive other welfare benefits (such as food stamps, SSI, Medicaid, and housing) even after they leave the AFDC caseload.
<p>
As Chart 2 shows, among those families currently receiving AFDC, 72 percent have already spent over two years on AFDC, and nearly half have already spent over five years on AFDC. 
<p>
Looking into the future and making projections based on the historical patterns of AFDC receipt, it is clear that among the 4.7 million families currently on AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. And more than three quarters of current AFDC families will spend over five years on the AFDC caseload.
<p>
Long-term welfare dependence is most common among women who have children out of wedlock. Never-married mothers, in general, remain on AFDC twice as long as divorced mothers.
<p>

<b>DOES WELFARE BENEFIT CHILDREN?</b>
<p>
The current debate over welfare reform involves conflicting visions of society and the impact of welfare on human behavior. Real reform will not be achieved until specific core assumptions which form the foundation of the modern welfare state have been overturned and discarded. From its onset, the liberal welfare state has been founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:
<p>
<b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.
<p>
<b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Therefore, welfare is good for kids.
<p>
From this logic has sprung a relentless thirty-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The current proposal from Congress to slow down the automatic growth of welfare spending violates these cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system and thus has led to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment.
<p>
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of an increasing number of young Americans.
<p>
It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually. The first is that raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children. The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that "poverty" causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.
<p>
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values which are key to the child's success.
<p>
The second flawed liberal premise is that it is very easy to raise family income through welfare. This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.
<p>
This is borne out by experimental evidence. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80.<sup>4</sup>  The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs:  Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment.
<p>
The third liberal tenet is that higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life. In certain limited cases, such as when welfare is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives. While higher welfare payments and spending do not benefit children directly, they do increase dependence and illegitimacy, both of which have devastating negative effects on child well-being. Thus, overall, welfare operates as a system of organized, well-funded child abuse. 
<p>
The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, recently published research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high benefit states.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>6</sup>  Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children.
<p>
Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
O'Neill and Hill conclude:
<p><bq>
	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states.<sup>8</sup>
</bq><p>
A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher <i>non-welfare income</i> obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25).<sup>9</sup>  However, <i>welfare income</i> had the opposite effect:  The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing, up the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.
<p>
A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.
<p>
Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women who are raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare.<sup>11</sup>  Similarly, single mothers who were raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers who were not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
Boys raised in single-parent households receiving public housing aid are more than five times more likely to engage in criminal activity than are boys who are not raised in such conditions. Young girls raised in single-parent homes in public housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out of wedlock themselves than are girls who are not raised in such conditions.<sup>13</sup>  In short, welfare usually operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult.
<p>
In attacking the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, the Clinton Administration has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Administration's report on welfare makes clear its belief that rapid automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
The Administration report is founded unequivocally on the failed hypothesis that combating "poverty" through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy which, in turn, have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed, not (as the Clinton Administration does) at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's plan.
<p>

<b>PUBLIC SUPPORTS CONGRESSIONAL WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
By overwhelming margins, the public supports the principal elements of the welfare reform passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Bethesda-based polling firm, for the Family Research Council in mid-October 1995.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
For example, by a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent Americans support the family cap. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock."
<p>
In contrast to proposals by President Clinton, the welfare reforms agreed to in the House/Senate conference will contain modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy. Three out of four of those polled agreed that the current welfare system makes it easier for women to choose to have children out of wedlock. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
However, the public still believes overwhelmingly that welfare recipients should be required to work. Ninety percent of those polled stated that "recipients of government welfare programs should have to work for their benefits."
<p>
Since it would be difficult to require all welfare recipients to work immediately, the reform bills passed in the House and Senate urge states to impose work requirements on the most employable recipients first. Specifically, the bills urge states to focus work requirements on fathers in two-parent families and single mothers without pre-school children before requiring work of single mothers with pre-school children. (Roughly half of AFDC families have no children under age five in the household.) The public agrees overwhelmingly with these work priorities. Eighty-eight percent of the public feels that work should be required of fathers and mothers of school-age children before it is required of mothers caring for pre-school children.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The welfare reform legislation which will be approved by the House/Senate conference proposes a reform of the current welfare system based on three central themes:
<p>
<b>Reducing the growth of illegitimacy;
<p>
Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
<p>
Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
Among the many elements of reform in the legislation, seven are crucial:
<p>
1) The bill will end the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC spending. Under the legislation, states which increase their welfare caseloads will no longer be rewarded by an automatic increase in federal funding. This change imposes a fundamental fiscal discipline at the state level which is essential to real reform.
<p>
2) The bill establishes a family cap. Under the bill, mothers already enrolled in AFDC will not receive an automatic increase in federal welfare benefits if they give birth to an additional child while on welfare. (However, states will be permitted to enact legislation to "opt out" of this requirement.)
<p>
3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states which reduce out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
<p>
4) The bill provides $75 million per year in funding for a new block grant for abstinence education.
<p>
5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill establishes serious work requirements for welfare recipients. Under the bill, up to 40 percent of the AFDC caseload will be required to work or become self-sufficient by the year 2002.
<p>
6) In contrast to all previous "work" requirements, in the AFDC program, the work requirements in the proposed legislation are real. Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a "pay after performance" rule. Recipients will not receive benefits until the required work has been performed satisfactorily. If the recipient fails to perform the required hours of work, benefits will be reduced pro-rata.
<p>
7) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of "workfare" is to reduce welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to maximize the number of welfare recipients in "make work" public service jobs. It recognizes that the best road to self-sufficiency is to reduce the number of persons who become dependent and get "hooked" on welfare in the first place. In contrast to President Clinton's plan, which rewards states for expanding "welfare addiction," the approach in Congress for the first time focuses on rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who get "hooked" on welfare in the first place.
<p>
Overall, the proposed legislation represents a significant and badly needed first step in overhauling a bloated and destructive welfare system. The proposed reforms will be of great benefit to society, the taxpayers, and, most important, welfare recipients themselves.

<title>Time To Enact Real Enterprise Zones -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>TIME TO ENACT REAL ENTERPRISE ZONES</i></h3>

Executive Memorandum No. 438<br>
October 24, 1995<br>

<p>
There is a genuine and urgent desire in Washington to trigger an economic rebirth of America's inner cities. But two rival proposals to help achieve that goal are the products of two profoundly different visions of how to generate economic development within inner-city America. One vision, which is the basis for an initiative being prepared by the Clinton Administration, assumes that progress can be achieved only if government leads the process of development and primes the economic pump. It calls, in effect, for an urban industrial policy managed from Washington. The other vision, which forms the core of bipartisan legislation intended as an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill, recognizes that the wise approach is not to try to pick winners and losers, but instead to provide the best possible climate of incentives and simplified regulation to foster local enterprises.
<p>
The White House view is that depressed neighborhoods can best be helped by steering more government programs into them. The Clinton Administration is readying a plan to do this by giving preferential treatment in awarding government contracts to firms operating in troubled neighborhoods. This initiative flows from the Administration's "Enterprise Zone" program, enacted in the last Congress, which centered on channeling government programs into targeted areas. The name given to that government-led program was particularly ironic since the original enterprise zone idea, developed in the 1980s, explicitly rejected the notion that government could trigger an economic recovery in the inner cities and called instead for a sharp reduction in regulation and taxes to spur business formation. That earlier version was not enacted.
<p>
A very different view of urban economic development is enshrined in bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate recently. The sponsors intend it as an amendment to the upcoming reconciliation bill.
<p>
The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act (S. 1252) is sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). Cosponsors include Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), John Breaux (D-LA), and Michael DeWine (R-OH.) The legislation would refocus and strengthen the Administration's enterprise zone program, based on a view of how to stimulate economic development in depressed neighborhoods that is very different from that held by the White House. Rather than have the government try to pick firms for preference in federal contracts, the Abraham-Lieberman bill seeks to make existing enterprise zones much more attractive to private investors. It would do this by eliminating the capital gains tax on investments in stock, business property, or a partnership in the zones, as well as by providing other tax incentives for direct investments and business redevelopment within the zones. The government would not limit these incentives to selected private investors or firms.
<p>
This approach understands that private investors are more likely than government officials to identify the entrepreneurs that can be the engines of economic development in depressed neighborhoods. It also recognizes that one of the main obstacles to business creation in these areas, particularly for small new firms, is the difficulty of attracting start-up and working capital. For small new enterprises, capital typically is obtained from  personal savings or private investors, not from the government--or even banks. That is why the capital gains tax exemption and other investor incentives in the Abraham-Lieberman bill are so important. As Senator Lieberman put it in a 1993 floor statement criticizing the lack of such incentives in the Clinton enterprise zone legislation, "Capital incentives are important because they are the one way... in which the government, with a small  expenditure, by reducing taxes, can draw in a large amount of private capital."
<p>
Stimulating a flow of private investor capital also recognizes that the firms most likely to succeed in a blighted area probably will not attract the attention of government. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise for several years has been drawing public attention to the remarkable economic successes of locally generated inner-city enterprises in the most unlikely situations. Most of these enterprises would not qualify for a government contract or grant even if they sought it. But with the incentives of the Abraham-Lieberman bill, they are exactly the kind of innovative, upstart firms that would be sought out by risk-taking small investors.
<p>
These firms in the inner city also would be helped by another feature of the bill intended to remove some of the obstacles that add to the cost and frustrations of starting an enterprise. Within the enhanced enterprise zones, local governments could request waivers from federal regulations (other than civil rights, public safety, and similar rules) that hinder economic development. This is important because federal rules often unintentionally stymie economic and social improvement in depressed areas. For instance, restrictions on business activity in public housing projects in the past have blocked the creation of tenant businesses to provide child care, transportation, or other services that would make it easier for residents to become employed. Realizing the barriers posed by well-intentioned regulations that ignore practicality, many state and local governments have taken steps to simplify or pare back their own rules. The Abraham-Lieberman bill would require the federal government to do likewise in the zones.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation would take the first steps to help stabilize depressed areas in two other crucial ways. First, it would foster home ownership within enterprise zones. Based on proposals first developed by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the legislation would provide incentives and grants to encourage resident management and ownership of public housing and the ownership of vacant property. Experience has shown that resident management and home ownership encourage the sense of long-term commitment among the residents of a neighborhood that is so crucial to establishing a favorable climate for enterprise.
<p>
Second, the bill would give some financial help to low-income parents wishing to obtain a better education for their children by choosing an alternative public or private school. Though the provision is modest, it indicates that the sponsors appreciate that improving the climate for education, as well as for business and home ownership, is crucial to achieving the economic turnaround of inner-city America.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation brings together a surprising group of bipartisan co-sponsors. They are united behind an approach to urban improvement that recognizes the failures of government-led economic development and the need instead to create a positive climate for investing in small local enterprises. If Congress is to play its proper role in reviving the inner cities, and the hopes of those who live there, the first step would be to include the Abraham-Lieberman legislation in the budget reconciliation bill.

<title>Behind the Census Bureau's Good News on Poverty -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>Behind the Census Bureau's Good News on Poverty</i></h3>

Americans no doubt were relieved to hear last week that, according to the federal government's official poverty estimates, the number of people in poverty went down in 1994. But if the number is to go down further in this and future years, Congress and the American people need to look behind the Census Bureau data to understand what really has been happening and what lessons must be learned.
<p>
Broadly, it turns out that the best remedy for poverty is a strong and growing economy, not government "anti-poverty" programs. The lowest rate of poverty in recent years occurred at the end of the Reagan era. The "kinder, gentler" approach of the Bush-Clinton era has not yet managed to get the rate back down to that level. It also turns out that poverty is closely related to family structure: Children in poverty (the largest poverty group) actually means children in broken families. In particular, black poverty is associated with weaker families, while married black America is doing very well, showing the fastest gains among all groups.
<p>
Thus, the data show that the best social policy is economic policy that spurs job creation and income growth. If America is to continue reducing the poverty rate, Congress must concentrate on expanding the economy and jobs while reducing the illegitimacy rate. And if it combines this approach with consolidating welfare assistance to the states into block grants, there will be an increase in resources available to those who are still poor.
<p>
Specifically, the Census Bureau data show that:
<p>
<b>1) Jobs reduce poverty.</b><p>
During the Reagan era, an unprecedented period of economic growth led to the lowest poverty rate in recent history--despite criticism at the time that welfare programs were being cut. Even this year's good news for families--a drop to 11.6 percent of Americans in poverty--is still above Reagan's legacy of 10.3 percent.
<p>
One reason for this is that during the Reagan expansion of 1982-1989, jobs grew at an average rate of 2.25 million new jobs per year. During the business expansion of 1991 to 1994, however, the average rate has been only 1.9 million new jobs per year.
<p>

<b>2) Children in poverty means children in broken families.</b><p>
Of all children under 18, some 21.8 percent are in poverty. The recent Census Bureau report highlights the fact that children are the largest group in poverty, accounting for 40 percent of the total. Digging deeper into the numbers, one finds there are sharp differences in rates among children in different household situations. The vast majority of these children are children in broken families. Some 52.9 percent of all children in female-headed families are in poverty. By contrast, the rate among children in intact married families is just 10.8 percent.
<p>
Married family life is the best protection against poverty for children. Single parenthood--the "feminization" of poverty--results from the father and his paycheck being absent.
<p>

<b>3) Married black Americans have made the most sizable gains.</b><p>
Married couples and children in married families tend to benefit most from economic recoveries. In the latest Census release, this is most clearly shown in the numbers for black Americans.
<p>
In terms of income and poverty, there are two black Americas, and they are very different. Black married families are the biggest winners in the decline in the poverty rate. For married black Americans with children under 18, the poverty rate dropped from 13.9 percent to 11.4 percent between 1993 and 1994, from 298,000 to 245,000 families (an 18 percent drop in the total number of married families in poverty). But for black American female-headed families, the total number in poverty declined from 1,780,000 families to 1,591,000 families, and the poverty rate fell from 57.7 percent to 53.9 percent (a 10.6 percent drop in the number of female-headed families in poverty).
<p>
<b>4) Poverty affects "single-parent America," not "black America."</b>
<p>
Significantly, the number of poor female-headed families with children in the black community has increased from 949,000 in 1975 to 1,591,000 in 1994, while during this same period the number of married black families with children has decreased from 349,000 to 245,000.  The poverty rate among married black families with children (11.4 percent) is steadily converging with and now close to the poverty rate for similar white families (8.3 percent).  It is not that "black America" is in poverty and "white America" is not.  It is that "single-parent America" is in poverty and the black community contains more than its share of such households.
<p>
Three major policy implications are evident in these numbers:
<p>
1) The best possible anti-poverty policy is an expanding economy with increased job creation. Policies which favor the formation of businesses and investment, such as tax reduction and deregulation, however much they seem to favor the business owner, actually do more than anything else to cut poverty.
<p>
2) Intact married families are the best places for children, not only socially and developmentally, but also economically. Social policies which favor married life will cut poverty. Social policies which do nothing to discourage the formation of single-parent families--and worse still, which reward out-of-wedlock births--increase the number of poor and place more children in poverty.
<p>
3) Under the new welfare proposal being pushed in Congress, converting from an entitlement program to block grants will help those who remain in poverty. Even in good economic times, the welfare pie will continue to grow as a block grant, but the number of people in poverty actually will shrink, increasing the average per person. Using the discretionary powers left to them under current block grant proposals, the states can use this extra money in more creative ways to cut poverty.

<title>Which Will Survive: The Welfare State or the Republican Revolution? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>Which Will Survive: The Welfare State or the Republican Revolution?</h3>
<p>
<b>By Senator John Ashcroft (R-MO)</b>
Delivered August 4, 1995 at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, Washington, D.C. 
<p>
	It is an honor to be speaking at The Heritage Foundation. This organization, founded on the solid principles of a limited government and an unlimited America, is rightfully America's foremost think tank.
<p>
	As we gather here today, we do so at two important milestones:  first, on the eve of one of the most significant public policy debates of the modern era; second, on the eve of the congressional mid-summer break. I would like to take a few minutes this afternoon to assess the state of the revolution more than halfway through the first session of the 104th Congress and to speak to the profound and immense challenges now facing the Republican Party as the welfare debate unfolds. 
<p>
	I am as convinced as ever that last fall's unprecedented election was about more than voter anger and frustration. I am convinced that it was a call to responsibility for an arrogant national government that, for more than a generation, has repudiated the most basic laws and principles of our democratic society -- repudiating what can be called our nation's "survival values," the foundation that is our heritage. 
<p>
	These survival values are not a narrowly defined, partisan, sectarian set of values; they are the essential elements of our common creed. They are familiar to all of us -- responsibility, opportunity, community, mobility, and family. They are uniquely American and have allowed the huddled masses to rise from the ranks of the outcast to the ranks of the affluent, opening a golden door of opportunity to any who would enter. But for 30 years, these survival values have been explicitly repudiated by Washington's willful arrogance. For all of its good intentions, Washington has replaced responsibility with rights, opportunity with entitlements, community with handouts, mobility with dependency, and family with government. 
<p>
	Washington has sent the message that fiscal irresponsibility, unrestrained spending, and never-ending deficits are acceptable for government, engendering a belief that irresponsibility is acceptable at the personal level as well. 
<p>
	Washington has said that what children know is not finally as important as how they feel, robbing generations of the foundation of basic knowledge and the nobility of service to others.
<p>
	Washington has said that the criminal is the victim and the victim the criminal, unleashing a torrent of violence against America, and especially America's poor. 
<p>
	Washington has promoted welfare programs which encourage illegitimacy, discourage work, mock marriage, and require dependence, consigning generations to hopelessness and despair.
<p>
	It was to the Republican Party that the American people turned last fall as they sought someone to help restore the survival values repudiated by the last three decades of government behavior and programs. Our party has begun that task in earnest. We have moved in the right direction by passing a balanced budget resolution which signals to the public the right message of integrity and responsibility; by passing a crime bill in the House that begins to restore justice to an unjust system which devalues human life; and by having the House pass an education reform bill that restores to states the right to demand educational achievement rather than self-indulgent feel-good programs that teach baseless self-esteem.
<p>
	As important as these accomplishments are, I believe they will be seriously compromised if we fail to fundamentally dismantle and replace the current Washington-based, one-size-fits-all, micromanaged welfare system. Our efforts and our ability to replace welfare will be viewed by the American people and by history as a measure of our commitment to restoring our survival values, a bright line in our public life between cheap talk and real action. It is easy to call for a revolution, much more difficult to achieve its promise. But that is the difference between administration and leadership. The American people want leadership.
<p>
	Across the world, our enemy for nearly 50 years no longer exists -- the result not of a conquering enemy from without, but a defeat from forces within. What communism did to the Soviet Union is not unlike what welfare threatens to do to America; it stifled her spirit, lulled her into dependence, and compromised her greatness. Our danger today is to not recognize the threat, to believe that doing anything, so long as we do something, is sufficient. If that occurs, Republicans will have failed, the welfare state will have survived, our pathologies will metastasize, and an America that today stands on the brink of chaos will tomorrow be thrown into an abyss of mayhem. 
<p>
	In 1965, a young Assistant Secretary of Labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote,
<p><blockquote>
	 From the wild Irish slums of the 19th century Eastern seaboard to the riot-torn suburbs of Los Angeles, there is one unmistakable lesson in American history:  A community that allows a large number of young men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any rational expectations about the future -- that community asks for and gets chaos. In such a society crime, violence, unrest, unrestrained lashing out at the whole social structure -- these are not only to be expected, they are very nearly inevitable. 
</blockquote><p>
	Words of warning 30 years ago are now a jarring description of reality in modern America.
<p>
	Statistically, the America that concerned him then is no match for the America in which we now live. Then, the illegitimacy rate hovered around 8 percent overall -- about 4 percent for whites, 28 percent for blacks. Today, the overall illegitimacy rate approaches 30 percent -- about 23 percent for whites, nearly 70 percent for blacks. If current trends continue, and it appears that they will, every other child born in America will be illegitimate by the year 2000.
<p>
	In 1965, about 11 percent of all families with children were single-parent families. Today, that number is dangerously close to one in three American families. Of those homes, approximately 90 percent are homes without a father. According to certain projections, only 6 percent of black children and 30 percent of white children born in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18. To put it in perspective, for children born in 1950, 52 percent of black children and 81 percent of white children lived with both parents through age 18.
<p>
	The situation we now find ourselves in is one unprecedented in human history. And it is a situation best understood not in statistics, but in human faces -- in the balance sheet of human lives. During the past week, I have been going to the Senate floor every evening to talk about some of these stories. All of them come from reporting in the mainstream press. All of them are profoundly disturbing.
<p>
	For instance, there is the story of a five-month-old girl named Ariel Hill. She was born on Christmas Eve 1992 and killed in May of 1993. She lived with her 22-year-old mother and father and four other siblings in a squalid one-bedroom apartment in public housing. The family's principal source of income was welfare. One day, her mother grew tired of her screaming, placed her in a sink, and burned her with hot water. She had not been fed in days. She died weighing less than seven pounds. When investigators examined the apartment they found a scrap of paper with each child's name on it and the dollar amount that they were worth on welfare. A life reduced to the dollar amount of a welfare check. When lives are valued for the dollars that they bring in, what has become of our survival values?
<p>
	There is also the story of Ernesto Ventura. He is at least the fourth generation of a welfare family that includes about 80 welfare recipients and takes up nearly $1 million a year annually in welfare funds. The family and most of its members have given up hope of finding a way out of the welfare dependency maze. At the time of his abuse, his mother was 26, pregnant, and the mother of six children by five different fathers. She was a drug addict supported by welfare and neglecting her children. One night she grew angry at Ernesto and plunged his hands in boiling water. She waited three weeks before seeking treatment. The paramedics found him lying on a bare mattress covered with his own blood and excrement. A life trapped in a web of cultural dependence. When generations live and die in perpetual welfare, what has become of our survival values?
<P>
	Unfortunately, there are hundreds of stories like these. They are tragic and they are very difficult to talk about. But as difficult as it is, I believe that these stories are even more important than the statistics. They reveal the cold, hard realities of a cruel system that must be dismantled and replaced. The standard against which reform must be judged is not some utopian ideal, but the system that helped give us Ariel Hill and Ernesto Ventura. 
<p>
	These are the faces and stories that we must remember as Congress turns to welfare. Unbelievably, these are not the faces and stories of people victimized by a malevolent system, but the faces of people victimized and traumatized by benevolence -- by good intentions. If our current system had been designed by a foreign enemy intent on our destruction, it could not have been any worse. We need more than good intentions. Our goal must not be to feel good about ourselves in passing something; our goal must be to do good by those who are suffering daily. Our danger is not to be found in being too bold, but in being too timid in defense of our values. It is not in reaching for the ideal; it is in compromising for the conventional to the detriment of the needy. Half-measures and rhetorically powerful reform are not enough. This is a system that must be replaced.
<p>
	So when the Senate turns to welfare tomorrow, how can we tell whether it is enacting real reform?  Let me lay out a five-part test. 
<p><ul>
<li>	First, we must end welfare as an entitlement. The notion that people should receive federal welfare benefits even if they do not work, even if they abuse their children, is a failed and pernicious notion. Real reform will end welfare's entitlement status. It will free people from the shackles of governmental dependence to embrace the responsibility and opportunity that are the hallmarks of America's survival values. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Second, we must radically limit Washington's intermeddling, micromanaging, counterproductive control of welfare. For 30 years, our welfare system has been premised on the belief that Washington knows best. It has prescribed a one-size-fits-all system that, in reality, fits none. The bureaucracy has levied a sort of tax upon the poor, taking up money and preventing it from reaching those in need. Real reform means Washington's oversight of welfare should end. Instead, funds should be distributed directly from the Department of the Treasury to the states and monitored by an independent auditor agreed upon by both a state's governor and the Secretary of the Treasury. Anything less will ensure that those who have crafted our current welfare system will be around to "manage" whatever modifications this Congress makes. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Third, we must encourage a national debate on illegitimacy while simultaneously doing all we can to ensure that illegitimacy is reduced. Most of the problems surrounding welfare can be tied, in one form or another, to illegitimacy. It is at the root of the family's breakdown in the inner city; it is tied to everything from educational failure to crime; it is the lifeline of dependency. Much progress has been made in recognizing it for the evil that it is. We must encourage further debate and discussion of it. At the same time, we also need to send a clear and strong signal that reducing illegitimacy is a priority of any reform. Anything less is a retreat. 
<p>
	<li>Fourth, we must not fall into the trap of believing that laws alone will solve our welfare problems. As we all know from our experience in the drug wars, passing a law is one thing, changing habits something entirely different. In this fight, the Senate needs to enlist private and religious charitable organizations. These groups have a character entirely different from that of governmental entitlement. Theirs is the character of concern and compassion. Government's is one of sterile indifference. We need more of the former and less of the latter. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Last, we must realize that unanimous reform is seldom real reform. In 1988, we passed the Family Support Act. It passed by a vote of 98-1. It tried to be all things to all people. We have seen that it is detrimental to all. These are enormously difficult and divisive issues; genuine efforts at solution do not lend themselves to unanimity.
</ul><p>
	Today, senior Republicans will be introducing a bill that falls short of the tests we have discussed. We cannot fall short. We must call our nation to greatness. We must signal that ideas and principles are more powerful than Washington's politics and pragmatism. We must refuse to compromise the revolution without ever trying to retake our city on the Hill. We cannot settle for being rhetorically impressive while simultaneously being substantively lacking. Half-measures which tinker at the margins are predestined to fail. We can and we must do better. The debate in the hours to come will be interesting and it will be contentious, but it is a debate we must have. 
<p>
	Some of the tests that I lay down are controversial. Some might call them radical, others nonsensical. But if they are radical, it is only because the magnitude of suffering is unrivaled and unprecedented in American history. In these circumstances, half-measures and self-deception are a form of betrayal against the poor. 
<p>
	For 30 years, Washington has repudiated and rejected the proven values of our history. We have come to discover that these values are not traditional values; the testimony of our times reveals them to be our survival values. We stand prepared to reclaim them today, and the nation cries out for our leadership. Our resolve will be tested in the hours to come on a debate we must have. I believe we are up to the task.

Every morning for seven years, Linda Desrosiers  packed her lunch before heading to work as a high-school cook. "I wouldn't touch the food they had us make," she says. "People looked at it and smelled it, but no one ate it."<p>
School janitors in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, an impoverished textile-mill town, confirm Desrosiers's stories of platefuls of grayish green beans and "beef surprise" winding up in the dumpster. One janitor said he changed the high school's industrial-sized garbage bags at least twice in each of the three lunch periods. <p>
In recent months, liberals led by President Clinton have argued that the federal school lunch program "ain't broke" and shouldn't be fixed. They argue, persuasively, that kids who are hungry won't learn. But they also make the false assumption that students actually eat the meals that the government subsidizes. Rhode Island is proving that students' nutrition levels can improve dramatically when subsidies for school meals are slashed.<p>
This academic year, the state of Rhode Island radically reformed its school-lunch program by dumping a quarter-century of centrally planned purchasing, hiring, and cooking. The state cut its $11-million school-lunch appropriation to less than $200,000 and fired all but 11 of the 780 workers who administered, cooked, and served the lunches. Now, private food-service contractors like Marriott and ARA Corp. plan the menus and feed the students. The school districts still get reimbursement from Washington, but the federal money is sent directly to the local districts on a per-meal basis. As a result, combined federal and state subsidies have fallen from more than $23 million in 1993-94 to $12 milliona 48 percent cut. <p>
The result: Kids are eating better. In the past seven months, student participation in school-lunch programs has soared, nutrition levels have risen to among the best in the nation, and poor school districts like Woonsocket are generating a profit.<p>
Brandon Powers, a sixth-grader at Woonsocket Elementary School, says the only downside of the privatized system is that it has put an end to daily "school-slop sculpture contests." "Now the food is pretty good," he says, "so people prefer to eat it rather than build with it." Even Desrosiers, now a cook for Marriott, eats it every day.<p>
Students at North Smithfield High School now eat their hamburgers instead of conducting experiments on the effects of mustard, catsup, and relish on burger flight. And students at a magnet high school in Providence no longer request extra gravy with their mashed potatoes just to provide greater contrast for finger-painting with their food. <p>
School officials back up students' claims that they are eating more. Since a private contractor took over Woonsocket High School's lunch program, janitors haul away 75 percent less garbage from the school cafeteria. Irene Scripsack, the business manager for the North Smithfield school district, says her janitors only collect 5 percent as much garbage as they used to. Scripsack won't say how often she ate the state's food, but admits it was "quite rare."<p>
"The state-run program suffered from what I call 'orange-ravioli syndrome,'" says John Caparco, the principal of Woonsocket High School. "Just providing food students should eat does not mean they'll eat it.  They were simply out to lunch when it came to making the food appealing." Caparco admits even he didn't eat the old food. "Now I get it all the time."<p>
Ellen McKenna, a junior dietetics major at the University of Rhode Island, demonstrated that plate waste was cut dramatically at schools that used private contractors. For instance, she found that most of the hot-food trays were "completely cleared of food" before they were emptied in the trash at Marriott's Potter-Burns Elementary School cafeteria in Pawtucket, where 32 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Likewise, at ARA's Central Falls Elementary School, where 89 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, students ate almost all of their carrots, breads, burritos, and sandwiches. <p>
At the state-run cafeteria at Lonsdale Elementary School in Lincoln, a wealthier community where the state-administered program had not yet been phased out, students were "picking at their food," rather than eating it. On the majority of the trays, most or all of the rice, bread, and fruit had been left uneaten. McKenna reports that students had difficulty identifying the food, and tended to push it around the tray rather than eat it. For instance, one student said he couldn't identify his ham-salad sandwich. McKenna described it as a "pink mush on a roll."<p>
After privatization, not only are students eating more of the meals on their trays, but more of the kids are buying meals.  In Woonsocket, for instance, where more than 77 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, participation has soared under Marriott's direction. During the 1991-92 school year, this "severe-need" district served 2,652 lunches a day. Now it averages 3,486 lunches dailya 31 percent increase. Similarly, under the state-run system, Woonsocket only served 288 breakfasts daily; now it serves 597a 107 percent increase.<p>
Woonsocket is the rule, not the exception. In Providence, where more than 70 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price meals, participation has increased 22 percent since a private vendor took over the cafeterias. And wealthy school districts, like North Smithfield, have recorded 25 percent more students eating school lunches since the state system folded.<p>
Between bites of a chicken-patty sandwich, Pauline Goin says she and her friends rarely bought lunch when the state ran the cafeteria, because the food was always a mysteryin both appearance and taste. "The other stuff was, you know, welfare food, and it tasted like it," the sixth-grader says bluntly. "This stuff is regular foodyou know, for humans."<p>
Greater participation seems to improve discipline during the once-raucous lunch period. Woonsocket's Caparco says that the time his office spends handling discipline problems has been cut by about 20 percent. "If the kids are eating, it's harder to be fighting," Caparco notes.<p><b><center>Have It Your Way</b></center>
<p>
Ruth Eshelman, a nutrition professor at the University of Rhode Island, says that options are essential to students' satisfaction. "If I have a choice, I am much more likely to eat what I choose," Eshelman said. "If I have to eat carrots, they will be terrible, but if I pick carrots over green beans, the carrots might be wonderful."<p>
The state-run school lunch program offered no choice. Each week, newspapers across the state printed the upcoming menu with a total of five listingsthe entire state had one option each school day. Private vendors, on the other hand, offer about 20 alternatives daily. Woonsocket High School students, for instance, can now choose from five meats, several cheeses, and two kinds of bread in the deli line. They can also pick from a list of three or four hot sandwiches, two salads, and a pasta dish. In addition, the menu offers pizza and burritos. Even if the student tires of these regular items, several specials are offered each day. Students also choose from a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables at every meal. And parents are sent a monthly menu describing each day's choices and their nutritional value.<p>
Private vendors also increase participation by using name brands: Pizza is supplied by a local Domino's franchise, and burritos are cooked according to a Taco Bell recipe. The name-brand packaging and advertising raise the likelihood that students will actually like the meal.<p>
Private vendors recognize that student involvement is vital to customer satisfaction. In Woonsocket and Providence, groups of students and parents meet monthly with Marriott's food-service directors. Dina Dutremble, Woonsocket's business manager, says the state never responded to local concerns; private contractors, on the other hand, conduct weekly taste-tests. <p>
Sandra Caron, a senior at Woonsocket High School who is a vegetarian, says that these meetings have allowed her to buy her lunch at school for the first time. After explaining to the food-service director that she and several other students would be willing to buy lunch if vegetarian entres were more readily available, the company promised to look into it. "I suspected they would do what had always happened. Nothing ever happens," Caron says. "But within two weeks, there was a vegetarian item on the menu every day."<p>
Ellen Haas, a USDA official who supervises the school lunch program from Washington, doesn't trust the private sector. She insists that devolution to local districts, like Rhode Island's privatization initiative, will lead to "short-term malnutrition and a lifetime of serious and costly health problems." Her fears were echoed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who equated devolution to "a dagger pointed at the hearts of our children." But a careful review of nutritional data demonstrates that Rhode Island's new, private programs outperform its state-run lunches. Haas's office did not return several phone callls.<p>
Current USDA regulations require that school lunches provide at least a third of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of seven nutrientsranging from vitamins A and C to iron and thiamin. Rhode Island's state-run school-lunch program, however, did not meet these minimums. Bethany Algier, a nutritionist with Rhode Island's Department of Health, notes that a 1991 nutritional audit of the school-lunch program found that  the state's program fell short in vitamin C and iron and did not meet the target for calories. Plus, this audit assumed implausibly that the students were eating everything on their trays. Although liberals can speak of the value of mandating nutrition levels, Rhode Island demonstrates that these mandates are not even enforced, and it is impossible to ensure the students will even eat the food.<p>
The private vendors, however, combat both these flaws by providing more nutritious meals that the students actually want to eat. According to the Department of Health's nutritional audit, Marriott's menus exceed the state's program by at least three-fold in each of the RDA's seven nutrient categories. In fact, the private-sector program provides students with more than double the RDA of vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A600 percent of the federal minimum for school lunches.<p>
In addition to the RDA nutrients, the private vendors' meal plans have less fat, cholesterol, and sodium and more fiber than Rhode Island's state-run program. Over a 10-week period, the average Marriott lunch contained 33 percent less fat, 40 percent less cholesterol, and 40 percent less sodium than the state's lunches. Marriott's average lunch contained only half the saturated fat and twice the fiber of a government lunch.<p>
Desrosiers and other cafeteria workers don't find these numbers surprising. In the private kitchens, fruits and vegetables rarely come from the can, since the two leading companies, ARA and Marriott, can use their buying power to get price breaks on more nutritious fresh and fresh-frozen produce. In North Smithfield, the independent school-lunch program has promised parents that it will never deep-fry a single item it sells; it even uses low-fat mozzarella cheese on its pizza. This district's hamburger meat contains about 15 percent fat, while the state-run program never used beef with less than 30 percent fat.<p>
Most remarkable, however, is that private vendors don't just provide healthier meals that students will eat, they do it at a profit. Like discount book chains, Marriott and ARA make money selling a high-quality product cheaply by counting on high volume. The per-meal federal reimbursement formula gives the contractors an incentive to provide nutritious meals that kids will like, because the more meals they induce kids to buy, the greater their margins beyond fixed costs. So far, the strategy has paid off.<p>
The secret to making it all work is the plan's clever payment system. The complicated arrangement provides the private contractor with an incentive to feed more students and allows the school district to keep most of the profits. School districts pay the contractor an annual fee to run the program. This fee pays for everything from capital improvements to salaries and food. The school district then keeps all the money the students pay. In addition, the district keeps all of the per-meal subsidies Washington sends it. If these revenues fall short of the district's payment to the private contractor, the contractor assumes the loss. This way, the district can't lose money and the contractor has an incentive to keep costs down while serving more meals. If the district turns a profit, the contractor gets a small cut.<p>
Dutremble, the business manager for the Woonsocket School District, says that the school lunches were a daily headache under the state-run program. While the state provided all of the workers, menus, and food, her district had to pay for high-priced food-service equipment out of its local operating budget. These costs were often so high that some school districts could not afford "sneeze guards" in their serving lines.<p>
Under Marriott's direction, the program is self-sufficient and has already turned a $42,000 profit this year, most of which the district keeps. In Woonsocket, the money is being used to purchase a new $30,000 dishwasher and a truck to deliver meals more efficiently to the elementary schools. Providence's program will profit by more than $100,000 this year, and North Smithfield was $5,000 in the black as of January 1. <p>
In addition, fears that poor or small school districts would be ignored by private vendors are unfounded. In fact, poorer school districtssuch as Woonsocket and Providenceare considered more desirable contracts for private vendors. These students are less likely to bring a lunch than their more affluent peers and therefore participation rates rise more dramatically when the food improves. Small school districts in Rhode Island joined together to negotiate joint competitive contracts. Lastly, the state limits the threat of corruption by putting the program out for bid frequently. Rhode Island prohibits  school-lunch contracts of more than a year, and limits the number of renewals.<p>
Rhode Island's experiment with privatized school lunches is the brainchild of a state legislator, Paul Crowley. A restaurant owner, Crowley was appalled to discover wages in state-run cafeterias were more than $4 per hour higher than at private restaurants, while nutrition levels were substandard. <p>
For years, Crowley's efforts to privatize the program were blocked by state-employee unions. Two years ago, however, Crowley found that the Providence school board had conducted a study showing that a private vendor would save the district more than $600,000 a year. School officials there said they abandoned plans to privatize their program under union pressure. Crowley said the unions even sent busloads of lunch workers to their meetings. After public hearings, Crowley amended the state's Fiscal Year 1995 budget to phase out the school-lunch program this school year. Under the new system, local school districtsrather than the stateare reimbursed directly from the federal government. As in all states, students pay some, all, or none of the lunch cost depending on their parent's income; Washington coughs up the rest.<p>
"We should be in the business of teaching, not feeding," Crowley says. "If other people make a better mousetrap, it makes more sense to buy theirs than build your own." <p>
Although school-district officials universally praise the private-sector lunch program, some are concerned about the GOP's block-grant proposal. Providence officials, for instance, expect the district-wide student body to increase by at least 800 kids next year, and fear that the block grant will not cover extra meals. But Crowley claims the program will still thrive under the block grant proposal. As a district's population increases, more students will buy meals. Since private contractors get paid on a per-meal basis, a larger student body would compensate for a reduction in per-student dollars.<p>
Rhode Island is evidence that converting federal funds to block grants can only improve the nation's school-lunch program. Given full responsibility for the programs, Crowley predicts more states will turn to innovative private alternatives that cost less and maintain higher standards.<p>
In fact, Crowley believes if school lunches had been devolved years ago, Rhode Island would have privatized sooner. "We have found that local districts are best off when they handle this on their own," Crowley said. "Blockgranting can only help us continue on this path."

<title>Elderly Non-Citizens on Welfare Cost Taxpayers $328 Billion -- Heritage</title>

The United States welfare system is rapidly becoming a deluxe retirement home for the elderly of other countries. This is because many individuals are now immigrating to the United States in order to obtain generous welfare that far exceeds programs available in their country of origin. Non-citizens today are among the fastest growing groups of welfare dependents.
<p>
In 1994, there were nearly 738,000 lawful non-citizen residents receiving aid from the Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) program. This was up from 127,900 in 1982 -- a 580 percent increase in just 12 years. The overwhelming majority of non-citizen SSI recipients are elderly. Most apply for welfare within five years of arriving in the United States. 
<p>
The data show that welfare is becoming a way of life for elderly immigrants. An analysis of elderly immigrants in California by Professor Norman Matloff of the University of California at Davis shows that 45 percent received cash welfare in 1990. Among Russian immigrants, the figure is 66 percent; among Chinese, 55 percent. Worse, the trend is accelerating. Recent immigrants are far more likely to become welfare dependents than those who arrived in the United States in earlier decades.<sup>1</sup>
<P>
<i>If current trends continue, the U. S. will have more than three million non-citizens on SSI within ten years. Without reform, the total cost of SSI and Medicaid benefits for elderly non-citizen immigrants will amount to over $328 billion over the next ten years. Annual SSI and Medicaid benefits for these individuals will reach over $67 billion in 2004.</i>
<p>
Even with the implausible assumption that the current rapid increase of non-citizen recipients will halt and the number of elderly immigrants receiving benefits will remain at current levels, U.S. taxpayers would still pay over $127 billion over the next ten years for SSI and Medicaid benefits for resident aliens.
<p>
Immigration should be open to individuals who wish to come to the United States to work and be self-sufficient. America has opened its doors to those who seek opportunity. But immigration should not become an avenue to welfare dependence.
<p>
Congressional testimony by Dr. Matloff demonstrates that immigrants have a high degree of awareness of welfare policies and procedures. Besides word of mouth among immigrants, sources in foreign countries as well as the United States give advice on how to obtain welfare benefits. For example, <i>Zai Meiguo Sheng Huo Xu Zhi</i> (What You Need to Know About Life in America), a publication sold in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and in Chinese bookstores in the U. S., includes a 36-page guide to SSI and other welfare benefits. The largest-circulation Chinese-language newspaper in the U. S., <i>Shijie Ribao</i> (World Journal), runs a regular "Dear Abby"-style advice column on SSI and other immigration-related matters.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
Prudent restrictions on providing welfare to recent immigrants long has been part of the American tradition. Becoming a charge was grounds for deportation in the Massachusetts Bay colony even before the American Revolution. America's first immigration law, passed by Congress in 1882, instructed immigration officials to deport any person who, in their opinion, might become a public charge. Today, the Immigration and Nationality Act declares unequivocally:  "any alien who, within five years after the date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry is deportable."  The problem is that this provision of the law is ignored.
<p>
The presence of large numbers of elderly immigrants on welfare is a violation of the spirit, and arguably the letter, of U.S. immigration law. The relatives who sponsored the entry of these individuals into the U.S. implicitly promised that the new immigrants would not become a burden to the U.S. taxpayer. But many, if not most, sponsors are enrolling their elderly immigrant relatives on welfare soon after the end of the three-year waiting period. Once on SSI, there is every indication that these immigrants will remain on welfare indefinitely. 
<p>
Although many of the elderly non-citizens on SSI come from politically oppressive nations such as Cuba or the former Soviet Union, the majority do not. The single greatest number of aliens on SSI come from Mexico. Other nations, such as the Dominican Republic, India, South Korea, and the Philippines, also contribute large numbers of recipients.
<p>
Moreover, while Americans greatly sympathize with those individuals who have suffered from political oppression and economic failure inherent to communist regimes, U.S. welfare programs are not appropriate vehicles to redress that suffering, nor should they serve as a retirement program for these individuals. Just as the United States military cannot serve as a global policeman, U.S. welfare programs cannot serve as a global retirement system. 
<p>
Most non-citizens on SSI lawfully admitted to the U. S. have relatives capable of supporting them. To have brought a relative to the U.S. in the first place, the sponsor must have demonstrated a capacity to support that relative. And most sponsors do, in fact, support their immigrant relatives for at least three years after their arrival. If SSI benefits for non-citizens were terminated, in most cases the family support which sustained the immigrant immediately after arrival in the U.S. simply would be resumed.
<p>
Just as Americans expect an absent parent to pay child support for his children, so they also must expect individuals who voluntarily bring elderly and near-elderly relatives to the U.S. to support those relatives fully. This obligation to support should be permanent and should not be limited to three or five years as under the current law. Under no circumstances should the cost of supporting elderly and near-elderly immigrants to the United States be passed to the general taxpayer.

<title>Crime Rates and Welfare Spending -- Heritage</title>

<h3><I> CRIME RATES AND WELFARE SPENDING </i></h3>

The "Anti-Crime Bill" Congress will likely vote on this week
authorizes roughly $8.7 billion to create nearly 30 new "crime
prevention" programs ($7.4 billion for programs identified as
"prevention" and $1.3 billion for new "Drug Courts").  Many of these
new programs are little more than social welfare pork, adding a new
layer of bureaucracy on a welfare system that already costs taxpayers
at all levels of government over $310 billion per year.
<P>
      Supporters of the bill claim that crime will be reduced if
government provides community development aid, social services, job
training, and recreational activities.  They are wrong.
<P>
      Society has spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty since 1965,
yet the national crime rate stands at its highest level ever.  As is
shown in the adjacent chart, welfare spending since 1965 has grown in
real terms by 800 percent while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the typical rates before 1960. 
The evidence suggests that welfare spending, by promoting family
breakup, has played a large role in increasing, rather than decreasing
crime. (See Patrick F.  Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social
Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation FYI No.  19, June 29, 1994.)

Executive Memorandum #355<BR>
May 11, 1993<br>

     The Clinton Administration last week sent legislation to Capitol
Hill to create federal enterprise zones in depressed inner-city and
rural communities. With a record of success in 36 states over the last
decade, and strong bipartisan support for federal legislation,
enterprise zone proponents might have expected a bold measure based
firmly on the key principles of the concept. 
<P>
     But the White House package has little in common with the
enterprise zone idea. It is little wonder that a frustrated Senator
Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who co-sponsored enterprise
zone legislation in the last Congress, felt impelled to take to the
Senate floor to express his disappointment with the Clinton plan.
Lieberman complained that the enterprise zone provisions "show a
fundamental misunderstanding of the enterprise zone concept and the
reasons why so many of America's poorer areas have reached the point
of decay that they now experience." The White House package is, in
fact, just another dose of Washington-directed inner-city industrial
policy -- of the kind that has hastened the decline of America's
cities. The Clinton program actually is worse than nothing, because
state officials will be induced to adopt the Administration's
misguided view of economic development as the price for questionable
benefits.
<P>
     The enterprise zone concept was introduced in 1979 as a radical
alternative to decades of ineffective inner-city programs. These
earlier programs, from "model cities" and "urban renewal" to "urban
development action grants," assumed that Washington knew the solution
to urban decline. Learning from the failure of this earlier approach,
the enterprise zone approach is founded on three central principles:
<P>
Even depressed neighborhoods possess the seeds of economic
     development. The vibrant economic activity which once
     characterized inner cities does not occur today in large part
     because the "entry costs" of opening a legitimate business have
     been increased by heavy taxation and an explosion of federal,
     state, and local regulation. Thus in an enterprise zone, taxes
     and regulation are sharply cut to encourage entrepreneurs to take
     the risk of starting a business in a depressed community.
<P>
Entrepreneurs risking their own money are more likely than a committee
     of government bureaucrats to come up with the right mix of
     ventures to spark economic improvement. Thus the enterprise zone
     concept is the antithesis of government development
     micromanagement. Rather than tear down and replace buildings, or
     pick and choose firms to locate in an area, government would
     remove costly impediments and then allow entrepreneurs the
     maximum freedom to experiment within existing facilities.
<P>
Small, new businesses are the engines of job growth in the economy --
     especially in the inner city. Such businesses are the ideal
     ventures for the uncertain markets and generally less-skilled
     workforce in depressed neighborhoods. The enterprise zone thus
     focuses on reducing the costs and problems of these firms,
     including local regulation and labor taxes, and it provides
     incentives to encourage investors to risk their capital in small,
     new firms.
<P>
     These are the elements undergirding the system of state
enterprise zones now in 36 states, responsible over the last decade
for generating an estimated 250,000 jobs and $28 billion in
investment. Federal legislation has been considered necessary
primarily to deepen the investment incentives in zones, since states
can do relatively little to address taxes on capital.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's proposal, however, has almost
nothing in common with the enterprise zone concept, or the experience
and needs of the states, or the federal enterprise zone bills
previously introduced. 
<P>
Example: The White House still sees enterprise zones as experimental,
     despite the successes of state zones. Clinton would establish
     just ten "empowerment zones," with only six of these in urban
     areas. One hundred "enterprise communities" also would be
     established, but these would have few enterprise incentives, and
     would seem to be merely targets for a plethora of federal
     spending programs.
<P>
Example: The zones would be micromanaged from Washington. To obtain a
     federal designation (and thus tax incentives) state and local
     officials would have to supply a federal "Enterprise Board" with
     full details of a "coordinated economic, human, community and
     physical development plan" for the zone. This would have to
     contain information on such things as who was involved in the
     planning process, what public and private resources would be
     committed, and precisely what institutions would assist in
     development activities. Washington would then approve or turn
     down the detailed plan. Clinton Administration officials, in
     other words, would force their views on local communities -- the
     very top-down bureaucratic planning the enterprise zone idea was
     meant to end.
<P>
Example: The zone incentives are not right for start-up small firms.
     The Clinton incentives are aimed predominantly at labor costs,
     and generally are useful only to firms with a large income tax
     liability. Even the capital incentives, mainly expensing and
     accelerated depreciation, generally can be used only by
     profitable firms. But new, small firms in a zone usually make no
     profits in their early years, and so cannot use these incentives.
     What they need is investor incentives, such as capital gains
     relief, to encourage others to provide them with seed capital. "I
     cannot adequately stress the importance of capital incentives,"
     said Senator Lieberman in his criticism of the Clinton program,
     "... they must be targeted toward small business."
<P>
     As a presidential candidate, Clinton praised then-Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, and emphasized his support for
Kemp's enterprise zone legislation. As President, however, Clinton's
own legislation discards the bipartisan Kemp approach, except for
borrowing Kemp's terminology. Indeed it stands the whole enterprise
zone idea on its head. Enterprise zones were meant to rid the inner
cities of suffocating bureaucracy and central planning, and instead
give a green light to entrepreneurs with unorthodox ideas. But the
Clinton zones would be shaped by Washington bureaucrats, and
pioneering businessmen and local officials would in effect be forced
to adopt whatever neighborhood development strategies currently were
in vogue in the White House. That is why America's inner cities would
be far better off if Clinton's bizarre vision of enterprise zones
never reached the statute book.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Next week the United States Census Bureau will release its annual report on "poverty" stating, as it 
has for many years, that there are some 31 million to 32 million poor Americans, a number greater 
than in 1965 when the War on Poverty began. Evidence mounts, however, that the Census Bureau's 
poverty report dramatically understates the living standards of low income Americans. 
<p>
Here is a sample of facts that will not be mentioned in next week's poverty report.
<p>
* 38 percent of the persons whom the Census Bureau identifies as "poor" own their own homes 
with a median value of $39,200.
<p>
* 62 percent of "poor" households own a car; 14 percent own two or more cars.
<p>
* Nearly half of all "poor" households have air-conditioning; 31 percent have microwave ovens.
<p>
* Nationwide, some 22,000 "poor" households have heated swimming pools or Jacuzzis.
<p>
"Poor" Americans today are better housed, better fed, and own more property than did the average 
U.S. citizen throughout much of the 20th Century. In 1988, the per capita expenditures of the 
lowest income fifth of the U.S. population exceeded the per capita expenditures of the median 
American household in 1955, after adjusting for inflation.<sup>1 </sup> 
<p>
<b>Better Off Than Europeans, Japanese.</b> The average "poor" American lives in a larger 
house or apartment than does the average West European (This is the average West European, not 
poor West Europeans). Poor Americans eat far more meat, are more likely to own cars and 
dishwashers, and are more likely to have basic modern amenities such as indoor toilets than is the 
general West European population.
<p>
"Poor" Americans consume three times as much meat each year and are 40 percent more likely to 
own a car than the average Japanese. And the average Japanese is 22 times more likely to live 
without an indoor flush toilet than is a poor American.
<p>
The Census Bureau counts as "poor" anyone with "cash income" less than the official poverty 
threshold, which was $12,675 for a family of four in 1989. The Census completely disregards 
assets owned by the "poor," and does not even count much of what, in fact, is income. This is clear 
from the Census's own data:  low income persons spend $1.94 for every $1.00 in "income" reported 
by the Census. If this is true, then the poor somehow are getting $0.94 in additional income above 
every $1.00 counted by the Census. Indeed, the gap between spending and the Census's count of the 
income of the "poor" has grown larger year by year till, now, the Census measurement of the 
income of poor persons no longer has any bearing on economic reality.	
<p>
<b>Ignoring Billions of Dollars.</b> A key reason that the Census undercounts the financial 
resources of the "poor" is that, remarkably, it ignores nearly all welfare spending when calculating 
the "incomes" of persons in poverty. Thus, as far as the Bureau is concerned, billions of dollars in 
in-kind benefits to poor Americans have no effect on their incomes. Out of $184 billion in welfare 
spending, the Census counts only $27 billion as income for poor persons. The bulk of the welfare 
system, including entire programs that provide non-cash aid to the poor, like food stamps, public 
housing, and Medicaid, is completely ignored in the Census Bureau's calculations of the living 
standards of the "poor."  The missing welfare spending that is excluded from the Census Bureau 
poverty reports comes to $158 billion, or over $11,120 for every "poor" U.S. household.
<p>
The Census Bureau's poverty reports should be replaced by a new survey that counts income and 
assets accurately. With accurate counting, the number of poor persons would be shown to be only a 
small fraction of the Census Bureau's current estimate of 31.8 million.
<p>
<b>Behavioral Effects of Welfare.</b> However, the fact that there are fewer Americans living 
in material poverty than the official Census poverty report indicates, does not mean that the War on 
Poverty has been a success. Welfare spending seriously diminishes work effort and earned income. 
The largest effect of increased welfare spending is not to raise income but merely to replace self-
sufficiency with dependence. Welfare also undermines family structure. In 1965 the black 
illegitimate birth rate was 28 percent; today it is 64 percent. Properly measured, the number of 
persons in material poverty has shrunk since 1965, but at the unnecessary cost of producing a 
burgeoning underclass. The current welfare system has created entire communities where work is 
rare, intact families virtually unknown, and dependence on government a way of life passed on 
from generation to generation. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE CENSUS BUREAU UNDERSTATES INCOME</b>
<p>
The most comprehensive survey of welfare spending is provided by the non-partisan Congressional 
Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. The CRS tracks state, local, and federal 
welfare spending in 75 "means-tested" programs, which are programs with benefits restricted to 
persons with low or limited income.<sup>2 </sup>  The CRS figures include programs targeted to 
low income persons such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), food stamps, and 
public housing. By contrast, the CRS does not include programs available to the general 
population, such as Social Security.
<p>
In fiscal 1988, the CRS recorded $173 billion in means-tested welfare spending at all levels of 
government.<sup>3 </sup>  There was an additional $11.2 billion in Medicare spending on poor 
persons that year which was not included in the CRS total.<sup>4 </sup>  The CRS means-tested 
figures plus Medicare benefits for poor persons yield a total welfare spending of $184.2 billion in 
1988. 
<p>
During the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Americans were inundated by media reports of draconian 
cuts in welfare spending. But, the CRS data show otherwise.<sup>5 </sup>  Today, welfare 
spending is at an all-time high. Adjusted for inflation, welfare spending at the state, local, and 
federal levels rose consistently through the 1980s. As Table 1 shows, welfare spending in constant 
1988 dollars rose from $156.6 billion in 1980 to $184.2 billion in 1988. The total comes to $5,790 
for every poor person in the U.S., or $23,160 for a family of four.
<p>
<b>The Missing Billions</b>
<p>
	The Census Bureau considers a household as "poor" if its income falls below a specified 
"poverty income threshold."  In 1988 the poverty income threshold for a family of four was 
$12,675. That year, the Census Bureau estimates there were 33.3 million people who were poor 
before receiving welfare benefits; after receiving welfare benefits the number of poor persons fell to 
31.9 million.<sup>6 </sup>  In other words, according to the Census Bureau, $184 billion in welfare 
spending reduced the number of poor persons in the U.S. by only 1.4 million, or $131,570 in 
spending for each person lifted out of poverty. How is this possible?
<p>
The answer is simple:  In counting the incomes of poor persons the Census Bureau actually 
excludes almost all welfare assistance. Some 75 percent of welfare spending in the U.S. is in the 
form of "non-cash" assistance. Yet the Census Bureau ignores all non-cash benefits in determining 
the income of poor persons. Non-cash programs such as food stamps, public housing, energy 
assistance, school lunch and breakfast programs, and the Women, Infants, and Children's (WIC) 
food program are excluded from the Census Bureau's poverty calculations entirely.
<p>
Thus, the Census Bureau counts most persons receiving non-cash welfare as poor even if the total 
value of the welfare assistance received greatly exceeds the poverty income thresholds. 	 
<p>
Example:  In 1988, many indigent elderly couples in New York state received income support from 
the Supplemental Security Income program and public housing assistance worth, on average, 
$12,290. These couples also received Medicaid benefits costing an average of $7,548. Despite the 
fact that they received welfare benefits with an average value of $19,838, compared to the official 
poverty income threshold in 1988 of $7,704 for elderly couples, the Census Bureau counted such 
elderly persons as "poor."<sup>7 </sup> 
<p>
Example: In Massachusetts in 1988 a welfare mother with three children could receive welfare 
benefits in the form of AFDC, food stamps, public housing, Medicaid, and school lunch and 
breakfast programs costing the taxpayers $18,765 per year. The poverty income threshold for such 
a family that year was $12,092. But the family would still be counted as poor by the Census 
Bureau.
<p>
<b>Contradicting Itself.</b> The misleading income figures used in the Census Bureau's annual 
poverty reports even contradict other Census data. Each year the Census Bureau undertakes a 
detailed survey of family expenditures to determine spending on rent, food, clothing, transportation, 
medical care, entertainment, and other items. While the Census Bureau poverty survey estimated 
that the average annual income of the poorest 20 percent of U.S. households in 1986 was $5,904, 
the Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey showed that these same households were spending an 
average of $11,477 that year. Thus the Census Bureau found that low income households spent 
$1.94 for every $1.00 of income reported in the Bureau's own income estimates. <sup>8 </sup> A 
small part of this discrepancy might be explained by some retired or temporarily unemployed 
individuals spending their savings. But a major part is due to excluded welfare income. 
<p>

<b>Underestimating the Welfare State</b>
<p>
Table 2 analyzes the discrepancy between CRS and Census Bureau figures on welfare spending. 
According to CRS and other government sources, welfare spending was at least $184 billion in 
1988. But the Census Bureau counted only $27 billion in welfare assistance when measuring 
household income. Part of this difference can be explained by welfare spending on persons in 
nursing homes and other institutions. These Americans are not included in the population surveyed 
by the Census in compiling its incomes and poverty data. Excluding welfare spending on persons in 
institutions, total welfare spending still equalled at least $155.6 billion, so the total funds "lost" by 
the Census Bureau poverty reports amounted to $128.7 billion in 1988.

<p>
<b>Why the "Poor" Will Always Be With Us</b>
<p>
The Census Bureau not only counts the number of poor persons in the U.S.; it also calculates the 
"poverty gap."  This is the total amount of government assistance that would be needed to raise the 
income of all poor Americans up to the poverty income threshold. In 1986, the last year for which 
data are available, the poverty gap -- before persons received any welfare benefits -- was $64.9 
billion. <sup>9 </sup> After taking welfare benefits into consideration, the Census Bureau put the 
poverty gap at $48.8 billion.<sup>10 </sup>  Thus, according to the Bureau, $126.2 billion spent on 
non-institutionalized persons in 1986 shrank the poverty gap by just $16.1 billion. Every $1.00 
reduction in poverty, in other words, required at least $7.80 in welfare spending.
<p>
Besides the exclusion of non-cash aid in measuring the impact of government assistance, two other 
factors help explain why enormous welfare spending appears to make such a small dent on poverty. 
First, up to 10 percent of all cash welfare spending is diverted to administrative costs. Second, the 
government distributes up to half of all welfare spending to persons who have low incomes but are 
not below the poverty line.
<p>
The implications of these figures are sobering. The total pre-welfare poverty gap in 1990 is 
approximately $70 billion. Given the Census Bureau's current methods of measuring income, if the 
government expanded the existing welfare system, which provides 75 percent of benefits in non-
cash assistance and targets nearly half of all aid to non-poor persons, it would require a staggering 
$546 billion in welfare spending -- or 46 percent of the total federal budget -- to eliminate "poverty" 
in the U.S. As long as the Census Bureau continues to count poverty with its current methods, the 
U.S. inevitably will have a large number of "poor" persons every year for the foreseeable future.
<p>

<b>EXAMINING "POVERTY" IN AMERICA</b>	
<p>
In addition to the serious deficiencies of the Census Bureau's measurement of income, the 
government's view of what constitutes "poverty" would be surprising to most Americans. 
Government data on the possessions of officially poor households starkly contradict the general 
public understanding of what it means to be "poor." 
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Nearly a third of all "poor" American households have microwave 
ovens.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Sixty-two percent of "poor" households own a car, truck or van. Fourteen 
percent own two or more cars.<sup>12 </sup> 
<p>
<b>Example:</b> According to government figures, over 22,000 "poor" households have a heated 
swimming pool or a Jacuzzi.<sup>13 </sup>
<p>
Today, officially "poor" households are more likely to own common consumer durables such as 
televisions and refrigerators than the average family in the 1950s. In 1930, nearly two-thirds of U.S. 
households did not own a radio; over half had no form of refrigeration. Among the poor today, less 
than one percent lack a refrigerator.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
Seventeen percent of U.S. households in "poverty" have automatic dishwashers, well above the rate 
for the general West European population in 1980.<sup>15 </sup>  Among America's "poor" there 
are 344 cars per 1,000 persons.<sup>16 </sup>  This is roughly the same ratio as exists for the total 
population of the United Kingdom. A poor American is 40 percent more likely to own a car than 
the average Japanese; 30 times more likely than the average Pole; and 50 times more likely than the 
average Mexican.<sup>17 </sup>

<p>
<b>Housing Conditions of the "Poor"</b>
<p>
According to the 1987 U.S. Census Housing Survey, 38 percent of poor households own their own 
homes, with a median value of $39,205.<sup>18 </sup>  Nearly 50 percent of officially poor 
households are air conditioned. <sup>19 </sup>
<p>
The homes of these households, whether owned or rented, also are on average quite spacious by 
historic or international standards. By American standards, "crowded" housing means more than 
1.5 persons occupy each room. Less than 2 percent of "poor" U.S. households were "crowded" in 
1987, according to this definition, and only 7.5 percent of poor households had more than one 
person per room.<sup>20 </sup> 
<p>
On average, officially poor U.S. households have 0.56 persons per room, which means they have 
more space than that available to the average American household in 1970, and the average West 
European household in 1980.<sup>21 </sup>  By contrast, the average Japanese lives in a home 
with 0.8 persons per room, the average Mexican lives in a house with 2.5 persons in a room, while 
the average citizen of India lives in a house with 2.8 persons per room.<sup>22 </sup> 
<p>
Nearly all officially poor U.S. households, moreover, are equipped with basic modern plumbing, 
including running hot and cold water, indoor flush toilets and indoor baths. While 30 percent of all 
Americans were without indoor toilets, in 1950, less than 2 percent of poor Americans lacked them 
by 1987.<sup>23 </sup>  As Table 7 shows, America's poor are less likely to lack indoor plumbing 
than the general population in Western Europe. The average Japanese is 22 times more likely to 
lack an indoor toilet than is an American officially classified as "poor."
<p>
The houses and apartments of America's "poor" are in far better condition than generally assumed. 
The median age of such housing units is only seven years greater than the median age for the 
overall U.S. housing stock.<sup>24 </sup>  The overwhelming majority of this housing is in sound 
condition. According to the 1987 <i>American Housing Survey</i> of the U.S. Census, only 2.4 
percent of housing units owned or rented by households deemed "poor" had significant structural 
defects such as crumbling foundations or missing roof material.<sup>25 </sup>  Some 9 percent of 
poor households reported being uncomfortably cold at least once during the previous winter due to 
inadequate insulation, inadequate heating capacity, or equipment failure.<sup>26 </sup>  This was 
roughly double the rate for the general population.
<p>


<b>Food Consumption Of Low Income Americans</b>
<p>
On a per capita basis, low income households in 1988 spent 80 cents on food for every $1.00 spent 
by the median American household.<sup>27 </sup> And out of every food dollar spent by low 
income persons, 32 cents was spent in restaurants.<sup>28 </sup> 
<p>
Surveys conducted by the Department of Agriculture show relatively little difference in overall 
food consumption between high and low income households. Though the food purchased by low 
income households normally is of lower quality and less expensive than that consumed by the 
upper middle class, there is little evidence of material shortages. For instance, the average low 
income person eats 95 percent as much meat as the average person in the upper middle class. 
Measured in pounds of food consumed per week, low income persons actually consume 114 
percent as much poultry, 109 percent as much fish and 92 percent of the fresh vegetables consumed 
by the upper middle class.
<p>
Table 9, derived from studies conducted by the Nutrition Information Service of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, shows the average nutritional status of persons from three income 
groups:
<p><ol>

<li>Low income persons, from the least affluent 20 percent of the population.
<li>Persons receiving food stamps, and those whose income is low enough to be eligible for food 
stamps but who did not actually receive them.
<li>Upper middle class persons from the most affluent half of the population.
</ol><p>
The table compares average food consumption in each of the three income groups to USDA 
recommended nutritional standards. For all three groups food consumption exceeds the standards in 
almost every nutritional category. Differences between the upper middle class and poor in almost 
all cases are quite modest. 
<p>
<b>Food Consumption of Poor Children.</b> Many advocates have expressed concern about 
malnutrition caused by poverty among young children. In 1985 the Department of Agriculture 
conducted a thorough study of the food consumption and nutritional status of pre-school children. 
This study showed very little difference in the nutritional content of food consumed by low income 
as compared to affluent Americans. Children from families with incomes below 75 percent of the 
poverty level consumed 54.4 grams of protein per day compared to 53.6 grams for children in 
families with incomes above 300 percent of poverty (roughly $33,000 for a family of four in 
1985).<sup>29 </sup>  Black pre-school children consumed 56.9 grams of protein per day compared 
to 52.4 grams for white children.<sup>30 </sup>  Surprisingly, protein and calorie consumption was 
slightly higher among children in the central cities than in the suburbs.<sup>31 </sup>
<p>

Average consumption of nutrients was very high for pre-school children of all income classes. 
Protein consumption among children living in families with incomes below 75 percent of the 
poverty level equalled 211 percent of recommended USDA standards.<sup>32 </sup>  
Consumption of essential vitamins and minerals among both high income and poor children 
generally exceeded USDA standards, often by as much as 50 to 100 percent. Shortfalls were found 
in the average consumption of iron and zinc, but these were unrelated to income class or 
race.<sup>33 </sup>
<p>
<b>International Comparisons.</b> Rich and poor Americans typically eat rich diets in 
comparison to the rest of the world. The item most associated with an expensive diet is the level of 
meat consumption; as income increases, the level of meat consumption increases sharply. Table 10 
compares the level of meat consumption of persons living in the 20 percent of American 
households with the lowest incomes, with the average citizen in various other countries. There is 
very little difference in meat consumption between high and low income Americans, but the 
differences between poor Americans and the average population in the rest of the world are 
dramatic. Low income Americans eat 75 percent more meat than the average Briton and 61 percent 
more than the average Italian. In a nation allegedly afflicted with a "hunger crisis," low income 
Americans eat twice as much meat as the average Portuguese, and two and a half times as much 
meat as the average Mexican, and nearly four times as much meat as the average Brazilian.
<p>
<b>Poverty and Malnutrition.</b> Malnutrition and hunger caused by poverty are virtually non-
existent in the U.S. Protein and overall caloric intake are the most expensive factors of any diet. 
Nevertheless, in its extensive surveys the U.S. government has found no evidence of significant 
caloric or protein deficiencies among the poor.<sup>34 </sup>  Indeed, being overweight is the 
number one dietary problem of both rich and poor Americans.<sup>35 </sup>
<p>
Poor persons have lower levels of serum cholesterol than non-poor persons of the same age, sex, 
and race.<sup>36 </sup>  Moderate deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B6 
and zinc occur in part of the U.S. population but are unrelated to income class.<sup>37 </sup>  
Moderate calcium and iron deficiencies do occur more frequently among poor women than non-
poor women. But such deficiencies normally are the result of the type of food consumed rather than 
the amount of money spent on food; simply raising the income of poor women would have little 
bearing on the problem. A more efficient response would be to distribute inexpensive vitamin and 
mineral supplements to adult female recipients of food stamps and WIC assistance.
<p>

<b>CREATING A NEW POVERTY REPORT</b>
<p>
	The Census Bureau's annual estimate of poverty does not provide useful information about 
the standard of living of low income Americans or the impact of antipoverty programs. The current 
poverty report should be abolished and replaced with a new report based on the following 
methodology: 
<p><ol>
<li>The economic well-being of American households would be measured using a detailed survey 
of household expenditures, not the deficient "income" survey currently used.

<li>For those households receiving government non-cash assistance, such as energy assistance or 
public housing, the Census Bureau would determine the full cost of the subsidy provided. Special 
care would need to be taken to ensure that the number of Americans receiving such programs was 
properly counted. The value of medical benefits would be determined by what is generally termed 
the "insurance value":  the average cost of the benefits received by individuals of a similar age and 
gender.

<li>The survey would determine home ownership, housing quality, and other household assets. If 
assets exceeded a certain level -- say $15,000 -- the household would not be defined as poor. 

<li>Any household where expenditures plus the cost of additional government benefits did not 
exceed the current poverty income threshold, and which did not have assets above the fixed asset 
limit, would be counted as poor.<sup>38 </sup>
</ol>
<b>More Accurate Picture.</b> Such a survey could be conducted readily by expanding the 
existing Consumer Expenditure Survey undertaken by the Census Bureau each year.<sup>39 </sup> 
 The new survey would provide a far more accurate picture of the economic conditions of poor 
households than the current Census poverty reports. It would also give far more useful information 
about the specific financial needs of poor families, such as whether they lack sufficient funds for 
medical care, food, or housing. Such a reformed survey still would show that there are poor 
households in America. But by including all cash and in-kind income, and making proper 
allowances for assets, the number would be a small fraction of the 31.9 million poor persons 
estimated by the Census in recent years.
<p>

<b>WAS THE WAR ON POVERTY A SUCCESS?</b>
<p>
About half of today's official "poor" actually are elderly Americans with assets, working families 
who have suffered a temporary job loss or a divorce, or self-employed persons hiding income from 
the government. Few of these households are poor by any normal standard, especially when assets 
and non-cash benefits are counted. 
<p>
The other half of the officially poor population consists of what might be called the traditional poor: 
 welfare families and individuals and family heads with chronic underemployment. The material 
living conditions of this group are far better than the Census Bureau poverty reports suggest. Many 
have income and benefits putting them well above the poverty thresholds. However, it would be a 
mistake to conclude from this that the War on Poverty has been a success. On the contrary, these 
households, intended to be the primary beneficiaries of the welfare state, have turned out to be its 
victims.
<p>
The explosion of welfare spending in the last 25 years may, possibly, have raised the material living 
standards of some less affluent Americans, but it has done so at an enormous cost in terms of 
destroyed families, an eroded work ethic, and possibly irreparable damage to the social and moral 
fabric of low income communities.
<p>
<b>Welfare Dependence.</b> The strongest effect of welfare is to diminish work effort, reducing 
earned income and thus making families more dependent on welfare. In the mid-1970s the U.S. 
Department of Health Education and Welfare undertook the most extensive and thorough 
controlled experiment on the behavioral consequences of welfare ever attempted in the United 
States:  the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, known as "SIME/DIME," involving 
nearly 5,000 families over seven years. The SIME/DIME experiment showed that every $1.00 of 
welfare given to low income persons reduced labor and earnings by 80 cents.<sup>40 </sup>  In 
other words, while welfare is very ineffective in raising the incomes of the poor, it is very effective 
in replacing work with dependence. Recent national data show that among the poorest 20 percent of 
U.S. households there is only one full-time worker for every seven full-time workers in the most 
affluent 20 percent of households.<sup>41 </sup>
<p>
Tragically, the system designed to alleviate poverty in large part has been responsible for 
destroying the work ethic in low-income neighborhoods. There has been an enormous growth in the 
number of non-working poor families since the advent of the "War on Poverty."  In the 1950s, 
nearly one-third of poor families as defined by the Census Bureau were headed by adults who 
worked full-time throughout the year. In those days the problem was low earnings. In 1988, only 
16.4 percent of poor families had full-time working heads of households.<sup>42 </sup>  Today, the 
problem is that adults do not work.
<p>
<b>Destroying Families.</b> A second major consequence of welfare is the destruction of 
families. The black illegitimate birth rate was 25 percent in 1963 when the War on Poverty began. 
Today it is 64 percent. If current trends continue it will reach 75 percent within ten years. Recent 
research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that 
an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate 
birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent.<sup>43 </sup>  According to the Census Bureau, a 
single parent family is six times more likely than an intact married couple family to be officially 
poor.<sup>44 </sup>  To a considerable extent, the welfare state is generating poverty in the United 
States.
<p>
The impact of welfare dependency also seems to spread from one generation to the next. Children 
born into welfare normally remain in the system for many years. Of the 3.8 million families 
currently on AFDC, well over half will remain on welfare for over ten years; many for fifteen or 
more years.<sup>45 </sup>  Research shows that, holding demographic and income variables 
constant, being raised in a welfare family has serious negative effects on the behavior of young 
adults and their life prospects, as indicated by factors such as high school graduation, employment, 
criminal activity, and drug use.<sup>46 </sup>   And June O'Neill, Director of the Center for the 
Study of Business and Government at Baruch College, City University New York, has found that 
after adjusting for racial and socio-economic differences, young women from AFDC families are 
three times more likely to receive AFDC themselves, as mothers.<sup>47 </sup>
<p>

<b>Material Poverty Versus Behavioral Poverty</b>
<p>
In the late 1920s the median household income in the U.S. was around $1,600. After adjusting 
family incomes for inflation, over half of the families in this period would be considered "poor" 
using current official standards.<sup>48 </sup>  Indeed, nearly all adult Americans living today had 
a parent or grandparent who was "poor" according to the Census Bureau definition adjusted for 
inflation. Yet despite their low material standard of living, most of these individuals from earlier 
generations were not "poor" in a meaningful sense. Their behavior and values were middle class. 
<p>
But many of today's poor, while having a material standard of living above average Americans in 
an earlier period, are in another more important sense, very poor. They are trapped in "behavioral 
poverty":  a vicious cycle of illegitimacy, destroyed families, absent work ethic, crime, drug 
addiction, and welfare dependency. Senator Daniel Moynihan, the New York Democrat, has stated 
that "in many if not most of our major cities we are facing something like social 
regression."<sup>49 </sup>  The welfare state, while transferring enormous financial resources to 
these lower income Americans, adds to this "behavioral poverty," rather than relieving it. And the 
Census poverty reports, by exaggerating poverty in the U.S. and thereby stimulating even greater 
welfare spending, in a real sense has added to the misery of these households. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
It seems incredible to most Americans that so much can be spent combatting poverty and yet 
millions of households remain poor. They are right to be incredulous. The fact is that the annual 
Census Bureau poverty reports vastly overstate the number of American poor because in 
determining who is "poor" they ignore assets and dramatically undercount the incomes of low 
income households. 
<p>
An accurate examination of the expenditures, food consumption, housing, and assets of so-called 
poor families shows that there are far fewer persons in poverty than the Census Bureau indicates.
<p>
The principal reason the Census Bureau undercounts the incomes of the poor is that it deliberately 
ignores the effects of nearly the entire welfare system. Programs such as food stamps, public 
housing and Medicaid simply are excluded from the Census Bureau poverty estimates. The total 
welfare spending ignored in this way amounts each year to about $128.7 billion. 
<p>
<b>New Underclass.</b> Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that systematic errors by the 
Census Bureau mask success in the War on Poverty. Vast welfare spending designed to eliminate 
material poverty has in turn generated a new underclass, destroying the work ethic, family structure, 
and the social fabric of large segments of the U.S. population. Most material poverty has been 
replaced by a far deeper and more serious "behavioral poverty." 
<p>
<b>Census "Openness."</b> For most of this century the Soviet government conducted a 
"disinformation" campaign using government statistics to show that the living standards of Soviet 
citizens were far higher than they actually were. For thirty years the U.S. Census Bureau has, in 
effect, been conducting a disinformation campaign suggesting that the living standards of America's 
"poor" are far lower than, in reality, they are. It is time for "glasnost" at the Census Bureau.

<p>

	 For most Americans, housing quality has been climbing for
decades.  This is obvious by looking at almost any measure.  From
1960 to 1987, for example, dwellings lacking complete plumbing
facilities fell from 13.2 to 2.4 percent.  Those with central air
conditioning rose from 1.9 to 35.8 percent.  More important, perhaps,
the fears that the nation would not be able to provide housing for the
huge baby boom generation were unfounded.  By now, the baby
boom population almost entirely has found and moved into their own
housing.  Not only is this good news for the baby boomers, it also
means that America need not build as much housing in the next
decade as it has in the past.  The projected growth in new households
during the 1990s will be almost one-tenth slower than during the
1980s.
<P>
	 Yet despite these cheerful indicators, there are cries on
Capitol Hill that America confronts a menacing housing crisis. 
Within the past two months, the House and the Senate have passed
housing bills which rest, to a great extent, on such an assumption. 
The House bill (H.R.  1180) would spend $28.7 billion and the Senate
Bill (S.  566) $27.9 billion for fiscal 1991.  Both far exceed the $23.7
billion requested by the Bush Administration.   
<P>
 		 Shifting the Focus. Championing the congressional
measures, predictably, are the beneficiaries of big federal housing
outlays:  builders and realtors, "professional advocates" for the
homeless, and state and local officials.  Even their arguments,
however, reveal how much the American housing situation has
improved.  No longer do they denounce, as they used to, the quality
of housing.  Instead they have shifted their focus to affordability,
charging that the private sector produces many houses and
apartments that few can afford.  They claim, incorrectly, that millions
of young adults face the prospect of never being able to buy their first
home.  As evidence, they cite the slight decline in the ratio of owner-
occupied dwellings during the first half of the Eighties (which has
since been reversed), the "high" rent burdens on low-income
households, and the prospect of federally-subsidized owners of low-
income housing projects preferring not to renew their government
contracts.<P>

		  Federal Construction No Answer. To be sure, there are
housing problems in America.  But they are not the sort addressed by
the recently-passed House and Senate bills and certainly not the sort
that can be solved by enormous new sums of federal construction
money.  This is especially true for poor renters.  What they need is
greater purchasing power for housing, jobs near where they live, and
a reduction in crime and other factors that make their neighborhoods
unlivable.  This is much more essential than constructing tens of
thousands more publicly-subsidized units that lock the less fortunate
into the same apartment indefinitely, and at high taxpayer cost.
<P>
		  For homeowners and first-time homeseekers, the
problem is not getting more government-built housing, but reducing
regulation and other barriers that discourage private investment. 
Rent control, unreasonable building codes, and exclusionary zoning
all restrict the housing choices of homebuyers. 
<P>
		   In the present housing situation, several realities
cannot be ignored:  The supply and condition of America's housing
stock is adequate; demand over the next decade for new housing will
lessen; and the current national housing market is not "tight" with
respect either to availability or cost.

<P>
AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE SUPPLY
<P>
Abundant Housing Stock
<P>
	 During the past two decades, America has created more
housing than households.  In 1987, the U.S.  had an inventory of
102.7 million dwellings, a 49.5 percent increase over the 68.7 million
in 1970. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Housing Reports,
Series H-150-87, "American Housing Survey"; biannually.  All figures
from the American Housing Survey are taken from the 1987 survey
unless otherwise noted.  Results from the 1989 survey will be
published in late 1991.)
<P>
	   In fact, over one-third of America's current standing housing
stock has been built during the past two decades (assuming new
additions since 1987), the very period when pronouncements of a
housing shortage were becoming commonplace.
<P>
		  During this same 1970-1987 period, the number of
households grew by about 26 million, and the total population by
about 39 million. ("American Housing Survey.")  For each net
additional household, America produced 1.3 dwellings, and for each
net additional person, America produced almost 0.9 dwellings -- and
these figures already allow for demolitions and other inventory losses. 
The supply of housing thus has kept pace with need.
<P>
Few Housing Deficiencies

	<P> Standards as to what constitutes "good housing" typically rise
with improving technologies and rising real incomes.  Early in this
century, for instance, a three-room cold-water flat was regarded as
adequate housing for a young middle-class family -- at least as starter
housing; it would be unacceptable today even for a few months. 
<P>
		   Write George Sternlieb and James Hughes of Rutgers
University's Center for Urban Policy Research:  "When we were rich
we threw away housing; when we were of modest circumstances we
found it charming.  The very elevation of America's housing standards
and the real estate boom that characterized the era [the Seventies]
joined together in an enormous level of demolition and nonresidential
use." (George Sternlieb and James Hughes, "Private Market Provision
of Low-Income Housing:  Historical Perspective and Future
Prospects," in Preserving Low-Income Housing Opportunities: 
Principles for a 1990s Housing Preservation Strategy, Fannie Mae
Annual Housing Conference (Washington, D.C.:  Federal National
Mortgage Association, 1990), p.  7.)  The authors point out that the
U.S.  produced housing during 1970-1987 at a rate high enough to
raze many older, rundown dwellings without diminishing the supply.

	<P>	  Good Housing Overall.  The American Housing Survey
data in Table 1 highlight the overall good condition of the U.S. 
housing stock.  Among the major categories of housing deficiencies,
only water (primarily faucet) leakage occurred to any significant
extent.  Less than 5 percent of housing units had either holes in
floors, open cracks or holes, broken plaster, or exposed wiring.  Less
than 0.1 percent had no electrical wiring.
<P>
		  Table 2 demonstrates, using traditional measures of
housing quality, how far the nation has come in eliminating
substandard housing.  These figures are for housing conditions of
below-poverty-level households only. (The Census Bureau defines
poverty level status according to a family of four's cash income.) 
Over 95 percent of all poverty-level households in 1987 had complete
bathroom facilities, complete kitchen facilities, sink, refrigerator, and
stove/oven.  Almost 50 percent had air conditioning.
<P>
New Homes and Homebuyer Expectations 
<P>
	 During 1970-1988, the median price of a new single-family
home in constant (1988) dollars rose from $71,783 to $112,500, an
increase of 56.7 percent. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Construction
Reports, Series C-25, "New One-Family Houses Sold and For Sale,"
annually.)  While a good share of this may be plain housing-cost
inflation, a large part of the cost increase pays for increased quality,
as is clear from Table 3.  Median interior square footage increased by
over 30.7 percent, and the percentage of dwellings with central air
conditioning, one or more fireplaces, and more than 2.5 bathrooms all
increased by at least 85 percent.  The boost in home prices, therefore,
largely reflects features which are increasingly viewed as minimum
amenities by American homebuyers. 
<P>
		   To assess potential homebuyers' higher expectations, a
survey last year of present homeowners by the National Association
of Home Builders asked:  "If you cannot afford to buy the type of
home you want, what would you give up to make it more affordable?"
(National Association of Home Builders, What Home Buyers Want: 
Executive Summary (Washington, D.C.:  National Association of
Home Builders, 1989).)  Some 36 percent chose a house with
unfinished rooms, and 35 percent would live farther from work or
shopping.  Only 18 percent would accept a smaller house, and only 11
percent would accept fewer amenities. 
<P>

 AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE DEMAND
<P>
Slower Population Growth
<P>
	 During America's baby boom from 1946 through 1964, the
annual birth rate averaged nearly 25 births per 1,000 population. 
From 1965-1975, the rate declined to just under 15.0, climbing only
slightly to between 15.5 and 16.0 in the 1980s. (U.S.  National Center
for Health Statistics, Vital Statistics, annually.)  The Census Bureau
projects that from 1985 to 2010, the total U.S.  population will rise
29.0 million. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population
Reports, Series P-25, No.  1018, "Projections of the Population of the
United States by Age, Sex, and Race, 1988 to 2080," Washington
D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1989.)  Those in the 35-54
age bracket -- mainly today's baby boomers -- make up over 90
percent of the increase.  These are overwhelmingly people who by the
close of the 1980s had established their own households; they are not
seeking housing for the first time.  By contrast, the number of people
aged 18-34 will decline by about 8.6 million. 
<P>
		   As a result of these population shifts, the demand for
quality housing (especially owner-occupied) will increase, but the
demand for new housing units (especially renter-occupied) will be
lower then during the 1980s.  In every five-year interval during 1985-
2010, the number of people aged 35-54 will increase.  Among persons
aged 18-34 and 55-64, the cumulative population will decrease over
the whole period.
<P>
		  Also noteworthy, during 1985-1990, the gain will be over
11 million people; during 1990-1995, it will be less than 10 million;
and during 1995-2000, barely over 8 million.  Therefore, because
population will be increasing at a steadily slower rate, future housing
demand, other things held equal, will be lower than at present.
<P>

Slower Growth in Number of Households
<P>
	 The Census Bureau projects that the number of households
will increase by 11.7 million between 1990 and 2000 (1.17 million per
year), with those aged 35-54 accounting for 11.2 million of the
increase. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports,
Series P-25, No.  986, "Projections of the Number of Households and
Families:  1986 to 2000 (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government
Printing Office, 1986).)  Households headed by persons 34 and under
will decrease by 1.0 million.  By contrast, the number of households
increased by 1.25 million per year between 1980 and 1988 (a total of
11.3 million).  Total households will grow by 6.1 million during 1990-
1995, and 5.6 million during 1995-2000.  Because of this smaller
growth in the number of households, America will need less new
housing in the 1990s than in the past two decades.  New housing will
have to focus more on single-family needs than before. 
<P>

 Household Type
<P>
	 The types of households accounting for the growth are as
important as the increase in the number of households.  Chart 1
indicates that there was a smaller ratio of households of married
couples with children in 1988 than in 1980.  In 1980, some 60.8
percent of all households consisted of married couples, of which
slightly over half had at least one child under 18.  In 1988, this figure
declined to 56.9 percent, of which slightly under half had at least one
child under 18.  Single-parent families accounted for a larger share of
all households in 1988; collectively, single-parent families with
children increased from 12.9 to 14.6 percent of the total. (.S.  Bureau
of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-20, No.  432,
"Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements: 
March 1988," (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office,
1989).) 
<P>
		   Over the past decade, the portion of non-family
households increased, and close to one-fourth of all households now
consist of one person.  A number of factors account for this increase
in single-person households.  Because the median age of first
marriage has steadily gone up for men and women since 1970, more
single young adults have their own households before marriage.  A
more important factor is the decline in the remarriage rate by about
20 percent during the 1980s among both divorced men and women.
(The median age of first marriage was 22.5 and 20.6 for men and
women, respectively, in 1970; it rose to 25.1 and 23.3 in 1986.  Vital
Statistics.) 
<P>
		   Incorrect Interpretation.  Some critics complain that
the growth in the proportion of non-family households signals an
increase in the number of those who are among the least well-off, and
therefore an increase in those in need of government assistance.
These critics incorrectly interpret the statistics.  Non-family and other
non-traditional households have emerged partly because they can
meet their housing costs.  The median household income of single-
person households in 1987 was $12,544 while per capita household
income for married couple households (with a national median of
3.27 persons per household) was only slightly over $10,000.  Among
female-headed families with children, with 3.13 persons per
household, the per capita income was $4,926, the lowest for any
category.  Having no husband present reduces the family's median
income by over half.  And while it is true that the availability of
subsidies helps the family afford housing, it is likewise true that the
incentive of the mother to marry or remarry may be reduced in the
process. (See Charles Murray, Losing Ground:  American Social
Policy, 1950-80 (New York:  Basic Books, 1984), pp.  154-166.)
<P>
		   According to Martha Riche, editor of American
Demographics, most people will get married, but will remain so for a
shorter period of their adult lives.  This is especially true for women. 
As a result, "the very definition of a house -- a single-family dwelling
-- is going to change because at any given time a greater share of
adults with money in the bank and a desire for a house will not be in
families." (Quoted in H.  Jane Lehman, "Future Shock:  Society
Redefining the Home Buyer," Washington Post, May 12, 1990.)  If her
argument is valid, then if anything, the changing household
composition would indicate a lessened need for subsidies. 

<P>
AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE MARKET
<P>
Fewer Persons Per Dwelling
<P>
	 Very little housing overcrowding remains.  In 1960, the average
household size was 3.33 persons; in 1980, it fell to 2.75; and in 1988,
to 2.62. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports,
P-25, (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office)
annually.)  The current housing stock affords individual privacy for
more people than ever before.  Even among the poor, fewer than 8
percent live in dwellings where there is more than one person per
room. ("American Housing Survey," Public Use Sample.)
<P>

Increasing Vacancy Rates
<P>
	 One of the effects of the high level of construction during the
past two decades has been a substantial increase in the vacancy rate
for rental units.  This has been especially noticeable in the past few
years.  In 1983, the total rental vacancy rate stood at 5.7 percent; in
1988, it was 7.7 percent. 
<P>
		   Advocates for the homeless who press for expanded
federally-subsidized new construction ignore the fact that there are
almost 9 million vacant housing units for rent or sale year-round. 
This is about fifteen dwellings for each homeless person, based on
last year's Urban Institute estimate of close to 600,000 homeless
persons nationwide. (Martha R.  Burt and Barbara Cohen, America's
Homeless:  Numbers, Characteristics, and Programs That Serve Them
(Washington, D.C.:  Urban Institute, 1989).)  These vacant units are
not "tenements" or "slums."  They contain a median of 4.3 rooms; 95
percent have at least one complete bathroom; and close to half are
single-family homes. ("American Housing Survey.")

<P>
The Myth of Declining Owner-Occupancy
<P>
	 Possibly the most enduring illusion about housing in the 1980s
is that Americans, particularly first-time home buyers, can no longer
afford to buy a home.  Those who lobby for publicly-financed new
construction use one statistic to particularly great effect:  In 1980,
some 64.4 percent of all occupied units were owner-occupied; in 1985,
the figure fell to 63.5. ("American Housing Survey:  1985.")  From this
modest decline in homeownership, federal program advocates
conclude that young Americans no longer can afford to own their
homes and thus that America's first-time buyers need massive new
federal assistance. 
<P>
		   This shift is misleading.  For one thing, from 1985 to
1987, the decline in homeownership rate reversed, increasing to 64.0. 
For another, even had the rate not risen, the homeownership rate
depends upon demographic trends that are ignored in the critics'
analysis.  Typical of this failure is the 1988 report by the Joint Center
for Housing Studies of Harvard University. (William C.  Apgar and
H.  James Brown, The State of the Nation's Housing (Cambridge,
MA:  Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 1988).) 
It claims that if the homeownership rate since 1973 had held steady
for under age 35 households, 2 million additional households would
now be homeowners.  This proves, says the study, that
homeownership is becoming more elusive for young households.  This
study is cited extensively by the real estate lobby in pushing for
federally-subsidized new construction such as those contained in the
Senate legislation.

		  Non-Family Households Growing.  The problem with
the Harvard report is that it fails to take into account the
proportional growth of non-family households.  Irving Welfeld, policy
analyst at the U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development,
points out that the homeownership rate for both married and single
households under 35 increased during 1980-1985.  The rate for
married households increased from 74.7 percent to 78.8 percent, and
for singles households from 45.0 percent to 46.9 percent.  Welfeld
concludes, "The modest decline in the overall homeownership rate
reflects the strong shift in the 1980s toward more single-person
households with a lower propensity to own." (Irving Welfeld, Where
We Live:  The American Home and the Social, Political, and
Economic Landscape, from Slums to Suburbs (New York:  Simon &
Schuster, 1988), p.  223.)  The changing household composition rather
than prohibitive housing costs explains the apparent decline in the
homeownership rate in the 1980s.

<P>
Exaggerated Cost Burdens:  Homeowners   
<P>
	 On balance, the evidence from a number of sources indicates
that with the exception of a few metropolitan markets on the East
and West coasts, a home was one of the economic bargains of the
past decade.  The 1987 American Housing Survey reveals that the
median monthly housing cost for homes with a mortgage was $621;
the monthly cost for homes owned free and clear was $203.  The
respective inflation-adjusted figures for 1980 were $504 and $176.
("American Housing Survey.") 
<P>
		   Data from Chicago Title and Trust Company's annual
home buyer's survey reveal that the monthly mortgage payment for
home buyers increased from $599 to $1,054 during 1980-1989, (Who's
Buying Houses in America:  Chicago Title's 14th Annual Survey of
Recent Home Buyers (Chicago:  Chicago Title and Trust Company,
1990); also see 1980 edition.) but the ratio of monthly cost-to-gross
income decreased from 32.4 percent to 31.8 percent.  Even more
revealing, the portion of home buyers who were buying for the first
time increased from 32.9 percent to 40.2 percent, with one-third of
the increase occurring during 1988-1989.  The median purchase price
for first-time buyers increased from $61,450 to $105,200 (71.2
percent) over 1980-1989, but during the same period the median
income of the first-time buyer increased from $27,430 to $50,700 (84.8
percent). 
<P>
		   Declining Home Prices.  Also noteworthy are figures
from the National Association of Realtors' monthly, Home Sales
(formerly Existing Home Sales), which focuses on the cost of existing
homes rather than new construction.  The median price of an existing
single-family home in 1980 was $93,600, and in 1989 it declined to
$93,100 in constant (1989) dollars.  Many housing experts, in fact,
predict that home prices in the 1990s will rise more slowly than in the
1980s because of the plentiful supply. (Gary Blonston, "Era of Big
Profits on Sales May Be Over," Washington Post, May 12, 1990.)
<P>
		  Recent data in the Home Sales Housing Affordability
Index also contradict the notion of "unaffordable" homes.  In 1984, a
median income family had 89.1 percent of the income necessary to
qualify for a conventional 80 percent mortgage loan; in 1989, this
same family had 106.1 percent of the necessary income. (National
Association of Realtors, Home Sales, Vol.  4, No.  4 (April 1990),
p.12.)  Incomes relative to home prices therefore increased by nearly
20 percent. 
<P>
		   For first-time buyers, the Index increased from 64.9 to
74.2.  This means that the typical renter family in the 25-44 age
bracket in 1984 had 64.9 percent of the income required to qualify for
a mortgage on a typically priced starter home, assuming a 10 percent
downpayment; by 1989, this typical renter had 74.2 percent of the
requisite income.  Viewed from the standpoint of either all home
buyers or first-time buyers, a home has become less expensive over
the past decade due to increases in family income. 
<P> Exaggerated Cost Burdens:  Renters
<P>
	 Renters are less well-off financially than homeowners.  As
such, low-income renters face higher housing costs than individuals
who are able to buy a home.  Yet there is little evidence that there is
a critical shortage of low-cost rental units. 
<P>
	   	The 1987 American Housing Survey indicates that
renters had paid a median monthly gross rent of $399.  In 1980, this
median rent, when adjusted for inflation, had been $335.  The
increase was 19.1 percent in real dollars.  This, however, was largely
offset by increases in income.  According to the Census Bureau, after
adjusting for inflation, the median income for all households rose
from $25,426 to $27,139 during the 1980-1987 period, or 6.7 percent, 
excluding the rapid growth in nontaxable fringe benefits such as
medical insurance.  This offsets the 19.1 percent real increase in rents
by over a third.  The median rent-to-income ratio, meanwhile, rose
only from 27 percent to 29 percent. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census,
Current Population Reports, Series P-60, annually; "American
Housing Survey.")
<P>
		   "Unaffordable" units are generally defined as those that
generate rents (excluding utilities) exceeding 30 percent of household
income.  According to Table 4, some 50 percent of the rental stock is
readily affordable.  Housing advocates read into this that the other 50
percent is "unaffordable."  This is not true, at least with respect to the housing.  It may be true with respect to the income of the poor.  This distinction is extremely important.  It determines whether improving
the housing situation of low-income renters requires building more
housing or increasing the income that the poor can spend on housing. 

<P>
	 Underreporting Income. The professional housing lobby,
moreover, significantly underrestimates the income which poor
families have available to pay rental costs.  Housing interest groups
frequently note that according to U.S.  Census data, over half the
poor pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent.  Yet federal
data also show that the total annual expenditures on all items by low-
income households equals 320 percent of the alleged income of those
households.  Obviously, there is a problem with the statistics.  The
problem is not that poor households lack income to pay for rent,
food, and other necessities.  The problem is that the Census Bureau
dramatically underreports their income. (U.S.  Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditure Survey:  Quarterly
Data, 1984-1987 (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing
Office, 1989), p.16.)
<P>		  A key factor in the Census Bureau's miscalculation of
the income of the poor and near-poor households is that the Bureau
excludes non-cash incomes.  This enormously distorts the poor's
income because 73 percent of all government assistance to the poor
now is in such noncash forms as Medicaid, food stamps, and housing
subsidies.  In 1988, federal, state, and local governments provided
over $173 billion in welfare assistance to low-income households.
(Vee Burke, Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited
Income:  Eligibility Rules, Recipient and Expenditure Data, FY
1986-88 (Washington, D.C.:  Library of Congress, Congressional
Research Service, October 24, 1989), p.6.)

<P>	 Of this total, only about $27 billion is counted as "income" by
the Census Bureau.  Cash and non-cash welfare assistance, which the
Census Bureau and housing lobbyists fail to include in calculating the
income of American families, equals about $10,000 for each poor
household in the U.S. (Robert Rector and Kate Walsh O'Beirne,
"Dispelling the Myth of Income Inequality," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  710, June 6, 1989.) 
<P>
		   Generous Subsidies. Housing aid is a significant part of
support for the poor and thus must be part of any assessment of
whether the poor can afford rents.  According to a national study by
the Urban Institute, roughly half of all poverty renter households
receive government assistance in the form of housing subsidies,
welfare payments or both. (Sandra J.  Newman and Anne B. 
Schnare, Subsidizing Shelter:  The Relationship between Welfare and
Housing Assistance (Washington, D.C.:  Urban Institute, 1989).) 
Indeed, roughly 20 percent of the 7 million low-income renter
households receive both.  In the mid-1980s, the period of the study,
these transfer payments amounted to about $20 billion annually, or
almost $6,000 per subsidized poor renter household. (Newman &
Schnare, Subsidizing Shelter, pp.  ix, 2.) 
<P>
		   Evidence from the latest study by Harvard's Joint
Center for Housing Studies reveals a similar pattern.  In 1987, some
54.4 percent of all poverty-level renters were receiving a subsidy, and
19.0 percent received both housing and income subsidies. (William C. 
Apgar, Jr., Denise DiPasquale, Jean Cummings, and Nancy McArdle,
The State of the Nation's Housing, 1990 (Cambridge, MA:  Joint
Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 1990), p.  35.) 
Subsidized low-income renters paid $188 in monthly rent in 1987
(1989 dollars); unsubsidized low-income renters paid $360. (Apgar, et
al., p.  21.)  This housing assistance is ignored by housing advocates
who press for new construction subsidies.

		<P>  Critics of Reagan Administration housing policies often
forget that during Ronald Reagan's two terms, the number of low-
income households receiving housing assistance climbed from about
3.1 million to 4.3 million. (Scott A.  Hodge, The Myth of America's
Housing Crisis, Washington, D.C.:  Heritage Foundation, 1990, p.  6.) 
 Moreover, in 1987, about 5 million households, or over 70 percent of
the poor renters, paid less than the median monthly rent of $399.  Of
this total, about 2 million paid less than $200.  This figure does not
include any of the 600,000 poverty households who paid no cash rent
at all. ("American Housing Survey.") 

	<P>	   The truth is that low-income rentals are, as a whole
and by any conventional definition, "affordable."  Plenty of rental
housing is available.  If there is shortage of anything, it is not of
rental units but of sufficient rental income to allow landlords to
realize a reasonable return on their investment and thus give them an
incentive to keep their property in good condition.  Anthony Downs
of the Brookings Institution in his 1983 book, Rental Housing in the
1980s, points out that in the inner city, rents often do not even cover
carrying costs. (Anthony Downs, Rental Housing in the 1980s
(Washington, D.C.:  Brookings Institution, 1983), p.  114.)  This is as
true today as it was then.  This problem can be addressed only by
giving the poor ways to increase their incomes -- through greater
opportunities for full-time work, through incentives to maintain
nuclear families, and through vouchers to be used as part payment of
rent. 

<P>
 Rental Market Absorption 
<P>
How soon would newly-constructed rental housing be occupied if it
were completed today?  The evidence indicates here as before that
the U.S.  needs fewer new rentals now than a decade ago.  In 1980,
some 75 percent of all new apartments (five or more units per
building) had been rented within three months of completion.  In
1988, this figure had fallen to 66 percent, a decline occurring in all
regions of the country. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Housing
Reports, Series H-130, Washington, D.C., U.S.  Government Printing
Office, annually.) 
<P>

 SOURCES OF ALLEGATIONS
<P>
	 The insistence in the face of all the evidence to the contrary
that America faces a critical housing shortage -- and thus needs
massive federal subsidies for housing construction -- comes from three
distinct special interests. 
<P>
		   1) The real estate lobby.  Realtors, builders, and
lenders benefit most from new production and below market interest
rate housing subsidy programs.  Predictably, therefore, the National
Association of Realtors in 1988 called for the annual construction of
2.1 million dwellings, and the rehabilitation of 313,000 additional
units from 1988 through 2002, at a cost of $112 billion annually in
private and public investment. (Raymond J.  Struyk and Christopher
Walker, America's Housing Needs to the 21st Century (Washington,
D.C.:  National Association of Realtors, 1988).)  This, among other
things, would build close to 500,000 more units than the average
annual production during the high construction period of 1983 to
1987.  The National Association of Home Builders in 1987 advocated
a similar high-production program. (National Association of Home
Builders, A Blueprint for National Housing Policy (Washington, D.C.: 
National Association of Home Builders, 1987).)
<P>
		  2) Federal housing program advocates. Repeatedly,
they claim that housing is prohibitively costly and that this causes
homelessness.  Typical of such lobbies is the National Coalition for
the Homeless.  A 1987 report issued by the organization, still
reflecting the way it thinks today, states, "By far the most significant
cause of widespread homelessness is the increasing scarcity of
affordable housing.  Over the past few years, large numbers of low-
rent units in both the public and private housing markets have been
eliminated.  As a result, poorer Americans are now being squeezed
out of their homes and onto the streets." (National Coalition for the
Homeless, Homelessness in the United States:  Background and
Federal Response (Washington, D.C.:  National Coalition for the
Homeless, May 1987), pp.  5-6.)  The Institute for Policy Studies
argues similarly in a 1989 monograph, "Most simply stated, today for
more and more Americans, the dream of an adequate, affordable
home is no longer attainable.  On the contrary, the dream is fading
rapidly.  In terms of choices, security, neighborhood conditions, and
especially costs, the housing available to Americans is getting worse."
(Institute for Policy Studies, Working Group on Housing, The Right
to Housing:  A Blueprint for Housing the Nation (Oakland, CA: 
Community Economics, Inc., 1989), p.  2.)  This monograph is the
basis for H.R.1122, introduced in February 1989 by Representative
Ronald Dellums, the California Democrat, that seeks eventual
nationalization of the entire housing stock. 
<P>
		   3) State and local government officials, like the State
Council of Governments, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors.  Scarcely a month passed during the Eighties
without some mayor or governor blaming Congress and the Reagan
Administration for creating a nationwide housing crisis.  At last
October's "Housing, Now!"  rally in Washington, D.C., for example,
Ohio Governor Richard Celeste, a Democrat, said that a 75 percent
"cutback" in HUD's budget is the reason for homelessness. (Quoted
in Chris Spolar and Al Kamen, "Thousands March on Mall in Mass
Appeal for Affordable Housing," Washington Post, October 8, 1989.) 
In reality, HUD's annual budget was not cut at all; it increased from
$14.9 billion to $20.3 billion between the years 1981 and 1989.  In a
speech last year to the National League of Cities, Phoenix's
Democratic Mayor Terry Goddard, blamed the same alleged budget
reduction for the current housing "shortage." (Quoted in Karen
Diegmueller, "Middle America:  Priced Out of House and Home,"
Washington Times, March 15, 1989.)  The National Association of
Housing and Redevelopment Officials argues that the U.S.  will need
an additional 8 million new low-income units by 2000. (Ibid.)  These
groups understandably insist that the assistance must come from
Washington, as few state and local officials want to raise taxes
themselves to pay for the housing.
<P>
		  These special interests all seek to discredit vouchers
and other consumer-oriented approaches for improving housing. 
Instead, they want to return housing policy to the days of the costly
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, project-oriented
commitments for new construction and rehabilitation.  While this has
produced good housing, it has helped only a handful of eligible low-
income beneficiaries, and at a high taxpayer cost.  The FHA
programs do nothing for the vast majority of low-income Americans. 
The government could have subsidized far more units through
vouchers -- and with much less waste and influence-peddling.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
	 By every reasonable set of indicators -- demand, supply, and
market -- America is not suffering a national housing shortage,
neither in quantity, quality, or in cost.  To be sure, serious cost
problems exist, especially on the East and West coasts.  Finding a
good single-family home at an affordable price in the Boston or Los
Angeles areas is far more difficult than finding one of equal quality
and space in the Cincinnati or Atlanta areas.  Yet problems of
affordability, in whatever region or metropolis, are more linked to
barriers to supply, like overly strict building codes and exclusionary
zoning ordinances that inhibit the housing industry and households
from adapting to the market, than to an inherent failure of the
market. 
<P>
		   The temptation for Congress to devise solutions to a
trumpeted but putative housing "crisis" eventually may help create a
real one.  Proposals in the Senate bill, for instance, would increase
the federal government's liability for property foreclosures, high as it
is already.  This may threaten stable growth not only in the housing
industry, but in the entire economy. (Ronald Utt,
"Cranston-D'Amato's S.565:  Neglecting America's Poor," Heritage
Foundation, Issue Bulletin No.  152, September 22, 1989, p.  10.) 
<P>
		   Only if housing problems are placed in historical and
economic perspectives can solutions to them be devised.  The task for
policy makers is to enact a housing agenda that eliminates the factors
that inhibit the market from providing quality affordable housing for
all Americans.
<P>
		  On the supply side, localities should discard
exclusionary zoning ordinances which prevent new housing from
being built; anachronistic building codes that inhibit the adoption of
new cost-cutting technologies; and rent control.  Even more
important, the federal government should adopt fiscal and monetary
policies designed to keep taxes and interest rates low.  In a recession,
housing is one of the industries to suffer most heavily.  If housing is
seen as an unprofitable investment, then with or without a web of
government enforcement or subsidies, potential investment will
eventually move elsewhere.   
<P>
		  On the demand side, low-income individuals should be
given government assistance that gives them the freedom to live in
housing of their own choice.  To achieve this, housing vouchers
(which help the poor) should replace housing projects (which help
wealthy builders).  Jobs within reasonable commuting distance of the
poor's housing must be made as plentiful as possible.  The Enterprise
Zone approach, for instance, has created many jobs in Maryland,
Michigan, and other states, and would be more effective if instituted
at the federal level.  Conditions in inner-city neighborhoods must be
made hospitable to residents for housing investment to be attractive. 
No neighborhood can flourish when fear of crime is paramount. 
Hunter College Professor of Urban Affairs Peter Salins, a veteran
observer of New York City housing issues, wrote in 1986, "The heart
of the contemporary housing problem is that many of the poor live in
fairly decent dwellings in rotten neighborhoods, and they have little
money left over after they pay their rent." (Peter D.  Salins, "Toward
a Permanent Housing Problem," The Public Interest, No.  85 (Fall
1986), p.  29.)  His comment is as valid today as it was then.  Housing
policies, therefore, ought to be geared toward enabling the poor to
have more money left over after paying rent, and to live in safe
neighborhoods of their choice.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defending American freedom, security, and prosperity from foreign threats requires that America remain militarily strong and preserve its military alliances. It is no accident that the U.S. became involved in World War I and World War II during the first half of the 20th century when it was essentially a regional military power, still disinclined to exercise global leadership. Nor is it an accident that there have been no world wars and few major U.S. wars since America's emergence as a global power and leader of the West after 1945. The lesson of history is clear: The best way to keep the United States out of costly major wars is to remain a global power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's status as a global power, however, could be in danger. The refusal of the Clinton Administration and Congress to provide adequate funding and other support for national security programs could leave the U.S. no longer able to make good on its commitments to military alliances in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. Analysts at the Heritage Foundation estimate that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its defense plan for fiscal years 1997-2002 by some $130 billion. If not corrected, this shortfall will leave America with a serious mismatch between its security commitments and the military capabilities needed to fulfill those commitments. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments. Indeed, the time is rapidly approaching when the U.S. will have to decide between remaining a global power capable of preventing wars or becoming a mere regional military power, condemned to fight and possibly lose them.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress needs to sound the alarm over this problem. Congress also needs to conduct a serious debate on how to close the gap. One solution would be to pledge the nation to honor its existing security commitments and propose increasing the defense budget over projected levels to meet these commitments. If Congress and the Administration are not willing to support a defense budget and force levels sufficient to honor U.S. security commitments, they will leave America with only one feasible course of action: partial withdrawal from existing U.S. security commitments while projected defense spending levels are held steady.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This second approach is not a solution, but an evasion. It would mean the end of America as a global military power capable of defending its freedom and interests. And it would mean the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort that Americans have not known since the first half of this century.
<p>
<b>U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS AND MILITARY CAPABILITIES: THE COMING MISMATCH</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the heart of the emerging mismatch between U.S. military capabilities and security commitments is declining funding for defense. Since 1985, U.S. defense spending has declined by about 35 percent (through the end of the last fiscal year, or FY 1995). Both Administration and congressional budget proposals would result in an FY 2002 defense budget that is between 6 percent and 8 percent below the level prevailing in 1995 (see <a href="bg1083c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Reductions of this magnitude mean that the force structure recommended by the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review cannot be sustained.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 falls roughly $130 billion short of what is required for the President's proposed force structure. In other words, the Clinton Administration is failing to fund its own defense force, and the size of the U.S. armed forces will shrink to levels below those recommended in the Administration's own Bottom-Up Review (see <a href="bg1083c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and defense critics in Congress have explained the reduction in resources for the military as a natural result of the end of the Cold War. However, while defense budgets and force structure have diminished, U.S. security commitments have not changed. These commitments are derived from such important security treaties as the Washington Treaty of 1949 establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Japanese-United States Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaties of 1951 and 1960 (see <a href="bg1083c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). Other non-treaty commitments, such as those to U.S. friends in the Persian Gulf, also remain in force. In addition, at the same time President Clinton is cutting defense, he is seeking to expand the level of American military commitments by increasing U.S. participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations and expanding NATO membership to qualifying states in Eastern Europe.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services. The Clinton Administration's policy calls for the Army to have ten active divisions, but the Administration's underfunding is likely to force down the number of active divisions to eight. U.S. security commitments to the countries of the Persian Gulf (in this case non-treaty commitments) oblige the U.S. to confront an attack on its friends in the region by either Iraq or Iran. As a result of this commitment, America could find itself fighting another Persian Gulf War, say in 2005. But sending the same number of active Army combat divisions to a future war in the Persian Gulf as were sent in 1990/91 would require more than seven divisions -- at least 70 percent of active Army divisions called for under the Bottom-Up Review, and 87 percent of the active divisions likely to result from Clinton Administration budget policy. Similar demands would exist for the combat forces of the other services (see <a href="bg1083c4.gif">Chart 4</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The demand placed on military support systems by U.S. security commitments cannot be quantified as easily, because such support systems as strategic lift, worldwide communications, and intelligence are global in scope and can be used to support combat forces in several regions concurrently. Nevertheless, it is accurate to say that the cost of developing and procuring this global infrastructure is based on the worldwide scope of U.S. commitments and is very expensive. For example, the Pentagon has spent roughly $6 billion annually on developing, procuring, and operating its airlift and sealift systems during the 1990s.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<b>THE FINANCIAL COST OF U.S. MILITARY LEADERSHIP: THE PERSIAN GULF WAR MODEL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some critics of defense spending are quick to point out that the U.S. defense budget is three times larger than any other country's. They make this point to convince both Congress and the American people that the defense budget can be reduced safely from projected levels without jeopardizing U.S. security commitments. This assumes, however, that the U.S. needs to spend only as much as--or slightly more than--other states on defense, particularly regional bullies like Iraq or North Korea. This assumption is wrong. The U.S. needs to spend much more than three times the amount spent by rogue states in order to uphold its commitments to its allies in important regions. The history of the Persian Gulf War demonstrates why.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
History shows that from 1988-1990, the U.S. had to spend annually some seven times as much as Iraq to defeat Saddam Hussein in Kuwait (see <a href="bg1083c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>3</sup>  The reasons: 
<ul><p>
<li>The U.S. needs to meet commitments on a global basis, which requires greater spending on overseas bases, logistical support, airlift, and other military infrastructure. By contrast, rogue regimes need only threaten a U.S. commitment in one region, which is considerably cheaper.
<p>
<li>American military forces need to project power to regions thousands of miles from American shores, while the militaries of rogue regimes have only to operate in close proximity to their own territories. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. requires a high-technology force to defeat its enemies with limited casualties. By contrast, rogue regimes have fewer high-tech military systems and care little for the loss of human life on either side. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. chooses to retain a more expensive all-volunteer force as opposed to a conscript army of the sort retained by Iraq.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If America wishes to remain a global power -- and it must if it wishes to protect its own freedom and security -- it must accept the burden of paying much more for its own defense than would its adversaries. U.S. forces are not "overstuffed."<sup>4</sup>  They are, if anything, already growing too weak to meet the challenging task of outgunning rogue states that have the luxury of spending less on defense than does the U.S. In this respect, rogue states are to the U.S. as an arsonist is to a fire insurance company: The arsonist, with his gasoline and matches, can spend much less than the insurance company, which either must focus on fire prevention or pay the cost of rebuilding a house burned down by the arsonist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This cost, though high, must be borne by the U.S. It was the price of victory in the Gulf War, and it will be the price of victory in similar wars in the future. U.S. friends and allies, like Kuwait, understand that if America does not make the necessary investments to protect its regional interests, it will be unable to fulfill its commitments. This is why reductions in the defense budget threaten to undermine U.S. security commitments. As friends and allies like Kuwait question American commitment, they may begin to seek security elsewhere. These commitments are more than an academic question for U.S. friends and allies: As any Kuwaiti will attest, their very existence as sovereign states may hang in the balance.
<p>
<b>ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the end of the Cold War, there has been no debate about whether the U.S. should continue to uphold its existing security commitments to friends and allies around the world. As a result, defense budgets and military forces have been shrinking without consideration for the potential impact on the alliance structure. The Clinton Administration is largely responsible for this state of affairs. First, it failed to fund its own defense policy. Second, it altered internal accounts in the Pentagon budget to fund daily military operations at the direct expense of its ability to buy new weapons for the future. This has allowed the Administration to retain a conventional force that for the last several years is larger than the budget otherwise would allow. As pressure to buy new weapons builds, so does the pressure to reduce the size of the force to free up money for new weapons.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress, however, has exacerbated the problem. The budget resolution approved last year, covering fiscal years 1996 through 2002, added more funds for defense each year for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Nevertheless, at the end of the seven-year period, in fiscal 2001 and 2002, Congress would spend less on defense than would the Clinton Administration. Further, even the $7 billion increase in defense expenditures Congress provided for the current fiscal year is not enough to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force structure. Putting the Pentagon on a path that funds both the readiness and    modernization needs of the military would require an increase of somewhat less than $20 billion.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One can only speculate about the sort of ugly reality the American people will have to face sometime during the next five years if Clinton Administration defense policies continue on their present course: for example, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the disintegration of NATO, an invasion of South Korea by the North, Russian hegemony over the "near abroad," or Iranian military control of the Persian Gulf. All that is needed is for the U.S. to be perceived as militarily weak and unable to uphold its security commitments in Asia, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Clearly, the time has come for Congress to clarify this situation for the American people.
<p>
<b>CALL TO DEBATE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best way for Congress to educate the American people about the emerging gap between U.S. security commitments and forces is to debate the issue. The mere fact that Congress is debating the issue will serve to bring home to the American people that there is a serious problem. As of now, they cannot know because the Clinton Administration refuses to acknowledge that the problem exists. As the American people become aware of the emerging gap, the likelihood that the Clinton Administration will be forced to address it increases. Then, and only then, can the gap between forces and commitments be closed.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress also can propose a resolution to uphold U.S. security commitments by increasing projected defense budgets to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force. Even with the additional funding, however, Congress would be required to propose a riskier strategy than the one proposed in the Bottom-Up Review. The resolution should admit this by asserting that, at best, the Bottom-Up Review force is capable of handling one major regional conflict (similar to the Persian Gulf War) and one minor regional conflict (similar to the 1989 invasion of Panama) simultaneously, as opposed to two major regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously" (a sample draft resolution can be found in the appendix to this paper).<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently projected defense budgets have America on a forced march along the path to military weakness and withdrawal. The alarming thing is that the American people are not aware that the nation is headed in this direction. A congressional debate over the future of U.S. security commitments is needed to start the process of educating the American people about this potentially life-or-death issue. The debate should be on a resolution that puts Congress on record as saying that America does not go back on its commitments to its friends and allies. Further, this resolution would make it clear that Congress will continue to provide the military resources, above the Clinton Administration's requested levels, needed to back these commitments.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress will deny that they wish to abrogate America's commitments to its friends and allies. But in this respect, their actions speak louder than their words. The American people need to know that a choice must be made and that the President and Congress so far have not made it. Hanging in the balance is whether America will or will not be a global power capable of defending its own interests and freedom, which requires it to meet its security commitments to its allies and friends around the world.

Assuming 100 percent of Iraq's annual defense expenditures in the years leading up to the war are counted as the cost of building the force used to invade Kuwait, Saddam Hussein's total investment would be some $13 billion per year.

<title>Keeping Faith with the Troops: Why Clinton Should Sign the DoD Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>KEEPING FAITH WITH THE TROOPS:
WHY CLINTON SHOULD SIGN THE DOD BILL</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 442<br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

On December 19, the Senate approved the Department of Defense authorization bill, sending it to 
President Bill Clinton for his signature. The bill authorizes national security programs for both the 
Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1996. 
<p>
President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto the defense bill. The President objects to the 
bill's provisions banning abortions at military hospitals, discharging military personnel with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and earmarking funds for shipbuilding and other programs. 
But his biggest problem appears to be the bill's demand that the nation begin building defenses 
against ballistic missiles. Clinton is prepared to sacrifice the entire DOD bill -- one that raises pay 
for U.S. troops, including those being deployed to Bosnia -- because he cannot tolerate a bill that 
demands protection for the American people against missile attack.
<p>
The President needs to take a step back from his thoughtless threat to veto the DOD bill. Too much 
is at stake to play politics with the nation's security and the lives and well-being of U.S. troops 
overseas. He should sign the DOD bill because it:
<p>
<b>Supports the troops in Bosnia.</b> President Clinton has argued tirelessly that the nation 
needs to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. He is right. But how can he demand that others support the 
troops while he vetoes the very bill that authorizes funds for the troops?  The Department of 
Defense authorization bill establishes the legal foundation for all the programs necessary to conduct 
Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia. These include programs for military pay, operations, and 
procurement, as well as many intelligence programs. While many of these programs already are 
funded through the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which was approved earlier, their 
proper management still requires authorization.
<p>
<b>Improves the quality of life for military personnel.</b> The Defense authorization bill 
provides a 2.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for military pay and a 5.2 percent increase 
in funding for housing allowances. A presidential veto will block the full implementation of these 
adjustments in pay and benefits. The White House statement on the authorization bill indicates that 
the President supports these adjustments, but his threat of a veto implies otherwise. Why would a 
President who vetoes an entire federal budget bill because it does not provide increases in benefits 
to Medicare beneficiaries at the rate he desires not give the same consideration to military personnel 
by signing the Department of Defense authorization bill?  Military personnel -- particularly troops 
risking their lives in Bosnia -- deserve at least the same level of presidential support as Medicare 
beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>Funds the Bottom-Up Review force.</b> In 1993, President Clinton adopted a new defense 
policy and force structure following the Pentagon's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). The Clinton 
Administration's defense budget, however, does not provide enough funding to support the force 
structure recommended in the BUR. The White House states that because the Defense authorization 
bill provides almost $7 billion more in funding for defense than the President requested, he is 
opposed to it. But all Congress has done is attempt to fund the Clinton Administration's own 
defense program. A presidential veto would mean that, in effect, the Clinton Administration is 
disowning its long-range defense program.
<p>
<b>Modernizes the force.</b> President Clinton has stated on a number of occasions that he 
wants to maintain the technological superiority enjoyed by the U.S. military at the time he entered 
office. But the defense procurement account, which is the primary account for providing modern 
weapons to the military, has fallen by more than two thirds since 1985. Whereas procurement 
funding consumed almost 34 percent of the Pentagon's budget in fiscal 1985, by fiscal 1995 it had 
fallen to 17 percent. Most of the congressional add-ons go to the procurement account. Congress 
believes that cutting procurement too fast will erode the nation's superiority in military technology. 
A presidential veto would mean that the President has decided to fritter away this technological 
edge.
<P>
<b>Defends America.</b> The most outrageous complaint leveled by the White House at the 
Department of Defense authorization bill is the objection against the bill's provision to deploy a 
national missile defense system. President Clinton has ordered 20,000 troops to Bosnia because it 
supposedly serves the national interest. At the same time, the Clinton Administration has stated that 
a national missile defense system will not serve the national interest. The President apparently sees 
a national interest in sending U.S. troops to a conduct a dubious mission in remote Bosnia but 
cannot see one in defending the American people here at home against missile attack. This defies 
logic and common sense. It also is morally irresponsible. Why should the lives and security of 
Bosnians be more precious that those of Americans?
<p>
The White House states further that a decision to deploy a missile defense system will jeopardize 
the reduction of nuclear forces in Russia. Its argument: Deploying defenses supposedly will cause 
the Russian Duma to deny ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II ). 
START II would reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals each to 3,500 warheads. The 
U.S. Senate is likely to approve ratification of the treaty in the coming days or weeks.
<p>
The likelihood of approval of START II by the Russian Duma is indeed remote. But this dismal 
outlook for START II has little to do with a decision by the U.S. Congress to deploy missile 
defenses and everything to do with a view popular in the Duma, especially in the aftermath of 
recent elections under the sway of Communists and nationalists, that the Russian nuclear force is a 
useful tool for coercing other nations, including the U.S. By what twisted logic can someone blame 
the U.S. Congress for the demise of START II in the Russian Duma?  Anyone familiar with 
Russian politics knows that the Communists, nationalists, and military-industrial complex oppose 
START II because they want to keep Russia's strategic arsenal strong, not because they feel 
threatened by America's desire to defend itself against Russian missiles.
<p>
In national security policy, a President must mean what he says. Bill Clinton claims to support U.S. 
troops in Bosnia, but his threat to veto the Defense authorization bill belies his professed regard for 
their well-being and their purpose. He says he supports increases in military pay and benefits, but a 
veto of the DOD bill would deny the troops these increases. The White House pretends to have a 
long-range defense plan -- its much-ballyhooed Bottom-Up Review -- but a defense veto would 
make it all but impossible to fund the President's own program. Clinton insists that he wants to 
preserve America's lead in military technology, but his draconian cuts in military procurement 
would devastate the military's ability to stay on the cutting edge of technology. Finally, the 
President has declared his intention to protect the vital national interests of the U.S., but he would 
veto a bill that attempts to protect the American people against the growing possibility of missile 
attack.
<p>
The President's actions speak louder than words. His promises have proven to be empty. It is time 
for Bill Clinton to make good on his promises, and his words, by signing the Department of 
Defense authorization bill.

The DAB must decide whether to complete the full planned purchase of 120 McDonnell Douglas C-17s, the Air Force's newest heavy airlifter. If this option proves too expensive, the DAB must consider a mixed fleet of C-17s and other existing aircraft, including what the Air Force calls a Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft, or NDAA.<p>The DAB is facing a momentous decision, since a robust strategic airlift capability is vital to the security of the United States. However, the cost of replacing America's current, aging strategic airlifters will be considerable. Supplementing the C-17 with the NDAA, a military version of Boeing's proven 747, may produce significant cost savings and still meet most of the Pentagon's future strategic lift requirements. <p><h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIC LIFT </h3><hr><p><b>America's Historic Strategy of "Forward Deployment"</b><p>In the 20th century the United States has been drawn into two global wars and numerous regional conflicts, but always with the luxury of fighting on someone else's soil, sparing the American homeland the ravages of war. This historical experience led the United States to adopt a strategic posture of "forward deployment" to contain the rise of Soviet Communism at the end of World War II. America's leaders determined to meet threats as far away from the continental United States as possible. For 45 years the U.S. has stationed large forces around the world, backed by the ability to reinforce and sustain those forces in the event of war. <p>However, the fall of the Soviet empire has brought about a dramatic withdrawal of forward deployed forces. American personnel in Europe have decreased from over half a million at the height of the Cold War to approximately 100,000 today. The growing integration of Europe and the rise of new security structures competing with NATO may bring that number down further in the future. The U.S. is turning over the Panama Canal to Panama and removing Southern Command forces from the Canal Zone. The U.S. has left the Philippines entirely, giving up naval and air bases that were the hub of the U.S. security posture in the Pacific. The Pentagon plans to maintain a force of 100,000 in the Pacific; but the future of the U.S. presence in Okinawa, recently wracked by demands for withdrawal, is in doubt. Even South Korea, a staunch ally which relies on Americans to help deter still-volatile North Korea, must contend with growing dissent over the U.S. presence. The clear pattern is one of global retrenchment and the inevitable return of most forward deployed forces to the United States.    <p><b>Protecting Vital Interests</b><p>Even though the United States is being compelled by budget cuts and other imperatives to pull back its far-flung forces, America's vital interests and obligations around the world are not undergoing a corresponding decline. The United States still has commitments or vital interests in Europe, the Middle East, throughout the Pacific region, and the Western Hemisphere. <p>The security and prosperity of the United States, a maritime trading power, depend as much as ever on unhindered passage of the world's sealanes and airspace, and on access to the world's raw materials and markets. America's leadership and credibility, essential elements of national security, depend on the ability to keep commitments to allies and friendly powers. <p><b>Replacing Forward Deployment with Force Projection</b><p>Without large, capable forces deployed close to the scene of potential conflicts, the United States may find it difficult to respond to a regional threat unless the nation replaces withdrawn forward deployed forces with the ability to project combat power to trouble spots. <P>Force projection includes the ability to deliver accurate attacks on key strategic targets like command, control, and communications centers or air defense networks early in a conflict. This is why America will continue to need the B-2 bomber, carrier-based naval strike forces to hit hard from the sea, and continued improvements in surveillance, real-time targeting, and precision-strike capabilities. <p>Force projection also means the ability to move men and equipment rapidly to the battlefield. Victory still depends, in the words of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, on "getting there first with the most."  Clearly the best way to get there first is by air. With enough heavy airlift, U.S. forces can arrive quickly with the weapons, munitions, spare parts, and heavy equipment needed to fight and prevail in a high-intensity campaign. <P>Of course, adequate sealift is required also to bring the huge stores needed to sustain the forces in a protracted conflict. But the Navy's fast sealift vessels require three weeks to reach the Persian Gulf, for example, and in warfare, time can be the decisive factor. Only strategic airlift can get troops and equipment into the theater in those critical early hours or days that can determine the outcome of the conflict. The U.S. can never rely on a future aggressor to give away the initiative as Saddam Hussein did in the Persian Gulf War, allowing the allies six months of unimpeded time in which to build up the force needed to throw him out of Kuwait. <p><b>America's Declining Strategic Airlift Capability</b><p>The Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR), which serves as the basis of current military strategy and force planning, calls for U.S. forces to be able to fight and win two nearly simultaneous medium regional conflicts. The BUR plan estimates that the strategic airlift requirement for such a scenario is 49-52 million ton miles per day (the measurement of tonnage carried over distance used by the Pentagon to compute its lift requirements). However, in the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. was able to deliver only about 17-21 million ton miles per day. That was an immense achievement. According to the U.S. military, it was equivalent to transporting the more than 500,000 residents of Seattle halfway around the world, along with all their cars, trucks, fuel, and food. But this level of airlift capacity may fall far short in the future if multiple, simultaneous crises erupt to threaten vital U.S. interests.<p>America's strategic airlift fleet, operated by the Air Mobility Command of the U.S. Air Force, is built around 231 heavy airlifters  the C-141 <i>Starlifter</i>, the C-5 <i>Galaxy</i>, the new C-17 <i>Globemaster</i> III, KC-10 and KC-135 tankers for aerial refueling, and a host of smaller support and command and control aircraft. KC-10 tankers also are being diverted for use as airlifters to meet shortfalls now common among the Command's C-141s. Supplementing the nation's strategic airlift fleet are 94 Guard and Reserve C-141s, C-5s, and tanker aircraft and the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), aircraft from civilian airlines brought into service in emergencies like Operation Desert Shield.<p>The problem is that this aging fleet is being used up at a faster rate than anticipated by the high number of sorties being flown in support of proliferating humanitarian and peace operations. No new C-5s nor C-141s are being built. The latest model C-141 entered service in 1979 and is nearing the end of its useful life, even after having gone through several overhauls or "SLEPs" (Service Life Extension Programs). These aircraft are simply wearing out and cannot fly much longer without endangering their crews. <p><b>OPTIONS TO REPLACE THE AGING FLEET</b><p>As the C-141 retires by FY 2003, the Pentagon proposes to replace the aging airlift fleet with the new McDonnell Douglas C-17, 40 of which will be authorized by the end of fiscal 1996 under current defense plans. At first the C-17 program was plagued with cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls, but the company and the Air Force appear to have worked out most production problems. The C-17 program is now on the way to producing a truly outstanding airplane. It cannot carry as much cargo as the mammoth C-5, but it does accommodate outsize items like helicopters. It can land on short, rough, undeveloped airfields close to the battlefront (which used to be limited to the tactical C-130) and can maneuver in tight spots to unload quickly. It also can conduct airdrops of paratroops and heavy equipment. In July 1995 the C-17 underwent rigorous reliability, maintainability, and availability testing at Charleston, South Carolina, and passed the tests with the enthusiastic praise of the operators. <p>The Pentagon originally wanted to purchase 210 C-17s. The planned buy is now down to 120, and even though the unit cost is falling as the contractor perfects its manufacturing processes, the planned C-17 acquisition is still an expensive program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the price per airplane at $251 million, including cost of support and spare parts. In total, the Pentagon would spend $21.2 billion to procure 80 more C-17s beyond the 40 expected to be approved in the fiscal 1996 defense bill. <p><b>CONVERTING EXISTING CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT FOR MILITARY AIRLIFT</b><P>The Defense Acquisition Board, in reviewing various solutions to the strategic airlift problem, must make a decision that will lead to one of the most significant aircraft procurements in U.S. history. The DAB must consider three main options:<p><ol><li>Complete the planned buy of 80 more C-17s;<p><li>Purchase fewer C-17s, order the restart of the closed production line of Lockheed Martin's C-5 <i>Galaxy</i>, and purchase more C-5s; and<p><li>Supplement a core C-17 fleet with a military version of the proven workhorse of the skies, the Boeing 747, which can be reconfigured for military use in a version known as the C-33.</ol><p>Since options two and three are cheaper, Congress is highly unlikely to approve option one, the full buy of 120 C-17s at a cost of $21.2 billion, if options two and three come close to fulfilling the ton-miles-per-day lift requirement. <p>While the C-5 is a capable aircraft with huge lift capacity, its advantages over the highly capable and more flexible C-17 do not appear sufficient to re-open production. On the other hand, the Boeing 747 freighter is in production now. This Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft can easily be turned into an Air Force C-33 with reinforced cargo decks, a widened side cargo door, and a door in the nose for military cargo like trucks and wheeled artillery. <p>The C-33 cannot carry outsize cargo like helicopters or <i>Patriot</i> missile batteries. Those items can fly only on the C-5 or C-17. But the C-33 can carry as much cargo as the C-5, and considerably more palletized bulk cargo than the C-17. Moreover, the low-wing C-33 can fly faster and farther than the C-17 (7,000 nautical miles) without refueling. For example, a C-33 could haul 280,000 pounds of cargo from Maguire Air Force Base in New Jersey to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and then unload and fly back to a rear area base in Cairo before needing fuel.<p>The Air Force has done a study called the Strategic Airlift Force Mix Analysis, which looks at a variety of options for a mix of existing military aircraft like the C-5, the C-17, and the NDAA, supplemented by the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. While it is up to the DAB and the technical and cost-effectiveness experts in the Pentagon to decide on the best mix, it is clear that a base force of C-17s combined with C-33s could meet almost all of the Air Force's ton-miles-per-day lift requirement, but at a considerable savings. <p>According to a newly released Congressional Budget Office memorandum ("Options for Strategic Airlift," October 1995), "If there was adequate room at airfields in regions of potential conflict, buying 32 more C-17's plus 30 C-33's would provide the same delivery capability as 80 additional C-17's. That option would also be nearly $8 billion cheaper...."<p>Seven or eight billion dollars in savings over the life of the program is considerable in light of today's defense budget pressures. Those savings could be applied to other vital national security programs like ballistic missile defense or the B-2 bomber without sacrificing essential strategic airlift requirements. In addition, using the military version of the Boeing 747 will produce savings in time as well as in money. It will speed up the availability of a highly capable airlifter to rebuild today's aging airlift fleet, which might not be up to the job in the event of another Desert Storm or multiple, simultaneous regional contingencies.<p>General Thomas Moorman, Jr., Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, says that "strategic lift has been the greatest deficiency in meeting the nation's two-conflict military strategy."  While supporting a robust C-17 program, the Defense Department and Congress have an historic opportunity to engage in meaningful acquisition reform by considering the C-33 to help fulfill the Pentagon's critical strategic lift requirement. At the same time, using the C-33 will rebuild the aging airlift fleet more quickly and produce significant savings in a period of tight defense budgets.<p><p><center><a href=/heritage/hbut.map><img src=/heritage/hbut.gif ismap border=0></a></center></body></html>                                                                                                        ....()()))()()                                                                  >  	                                        S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           P                        @    Y                        @    VK                                                                                              @                                      Microsoft Word 6.0                                                   4                                                                              >  	        0	  n	  ?  d  Q            #  -  ?  N  Y+  c+  ?/  J/  9  9  9  9  :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  u uD     U`V``    A          8  X  m    	    L  P        '	  ,	  0	  k	  o	      :  >  ?  a  e      L  P  Q          ;  ?               $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $        ,-  p  t  4!  8!  =#  A#  B#  l#  p#  n'  r'  x)  |)  })  )  )  *  *  *  *  *  +  +  ?,  H,  5-  9-   /  /  /1  31  C3  G3  4  4  77  ;7  |9  9  9  9  9  9  9   

<title>The U.S. Still Needs Military Bases In Panama -- Heritage </title>

Executive Memorandum #426<br>
August 21, 1995<br> 
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>

	On March 29, 1995, the Clinton Administration announced the transfer of America's military headquarters in Latin America, Southern Command, from Panama to Miami, Florida. This decision fulfills the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty's commitment that all U.S. troops be evacuated by December 31, 1999. It also reflects the Clinton Administration's view that the Canal can be defended without the presence of U.S. forces in Panama.
<p>
This viewpoint is mistaken. President Clinton's decision could lead to the permanent loss of valuable military assets and seriously weaken America's ability to defend the Panama Canal. The treaties with Panama give the U.S. the option of continuing a military presence in Panama after 2000. This option should be exercised.
<p>
	The 104th Congress could force a reconsideration of President Clinton's decision by passing a sense of the Congress resolution that the U.S. needs to retain a military presence in Panama after 2000. Such a resolution, while non-binding, would urge the Administration to negotiate an extension of base rights in at least some of the 14 U.S. military installations in Panama, helping to ensure a measure of power projection capability in an area of vital national interest to the United States.
<p>
<b>U.S. Treaty Rights</b>
<p>	Under the terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the United States must evacuate its troops from Panama by December 31, 1999. Under the companion Treaty of Permanent Neutrality, which becomes effective when the Canal Treaty expires, the U.S. retains the right to protect and defend the Canal after 2000. The U.S. instrument of ratification accompanying the Neutrality Treaty allows both sides to negotiate an extension of the agreement giving the U.S. the right to station troops in Panama and enjoy basing rights there. The government of Panama agreed to these terms. Thus, both countries agreed explicitly to the right of U.S. forces to remain in the Canal Zone after 2000.
<p>
	The extension of U.S. base rights also is consistent with the intent of Congress. The 1979 Panama Canal Act, which incorporated the treaty into U.S. law, included a sense of the Congress resolution that the "best interests of the United States require that the President enter into negotiations with the Republic of Panama for the purpose of arranging for the stationing of United States military forces after the termination of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977."
<p>

<b>The Need for a U.S. Presence</b>
<p>
	Southern Command, with a current strength of 8,800 troops, has been based in Panama since World War II. It coordinates all military and anti-drug operations in Latin America and is responsible for protecting the Panama Canal. Although the traditional threat of a foreign naval attack on the Canal Zone has virtually disappeared, the United States still needs to be able to project military power in the Southern Hemisphere. The worldwide upsurge in political instability and state-supported terrorism that has followed the end of the Cold War makes it necessary to provide rapid troop and logistical transit between the oceans. The need to conduct surveillance or to pursue actual and potential adversaries also requires immediate access to both oceans. Such possibilities make it essential that the U.S. retain a measure of conventional military power in the Isthmus of Panama.
<p>
	There are other reasons for the U.S. to retain a military presence in Panama:
<p>
*<b>	Efficiency and low cost.</b> The U.S. conducts a number of important non-military missions, including humanitarian and civil-military programs, throughout Latin America. These missions would benefit materially from the lower transport costs and greater efficiency afforded by centralized logistics bases inside Panama, especially Fort Kobbe, where the Theater Equipment and Maintenance Site (TEAMS) is located. This facility supports disaster relief missions and other civic and humanitarian services.
<p>
*	<b>Intelligence and counter-drug operations.</b> Panama is located in the center of a major drug transit area. U.S. facilities there are well-situated for collecting intelligence on drug trafficking and for supporting interdiction efforts. Anti-drug operations will remain a critical feature of U.S. policy in Latin America. The secure airport at Howard Air Force Base is available for logistical infrastructure and support for airborne operations. Other facilities in Panama, especially the electronic capabilities at Galeta Island, give the U.S. a unique capability to conduct surveillance of maritime traffic, drug smuggling, and potential terrorist activities in the region.
<p>
*	<b>Unique training facilities.</b> The Jungle Operations Training Center at Fort Sherman provides unrivaled facilities for training in low-intensity warfare, and the adjacent naval base provides training for small craft navigation. Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick C. Smith has stated that these sites "will be difficult to replicate elsewhere."
<p>
*	<b>Panamanian public opinion.</b> Polls taken in Panama over a period of years indicate strong and consistent pluralities in favor of a continued U.S. presence after 2000. As the staff of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere reported on March 9, 1995, "Recent public opinion polls in Panama suggest that 82% to 83% of Panamanians would like the United States to keep some sort of military presence in Panama."
<p>

<b>Time Is Running Out</b>
<p>	While the expiration date for the Panama Canal Treaty is over four years away, there is not much time to plan and negotiate for a continued U.S. military presence. 
<p>
	A sense of the Congress resolution urging the President to negotiate a new base rights agreement with Panama has been introduced in the Senate by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC). Such a new agreement would take effect immediately after the Panama Canal Treaty expires on December 31, 1999.
<p>
	In any such resolution, however, Congress must bear in mind three principles:
<ol>
<li> The U.S., not Panama, should initiate negotiations.
<p>
<li> An agreement should have the status of a business arrangement between equals. Panama would be the owner-landlord, the U.S. a tenant-operator. <p>

<li> Not all 14 U.S. military installations in Panama need be retained. Most of these bases can be turned over to Panama. Among the most important to retain would be Howard Air Force Base, Fort Sherman, Fort Kobbe, Galeta Island, and Rodman Naval Station.<p>
</ol><p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>	The end of the Cold War has led to a U.S. withdrawal from many foreign bases, particularly those that are no longer needed. Certain bases in the Isthmus of Panama, however, continue to serve America's interests. The decision to move the headquarters of Southern Command to Miami is irrevocable, but the decision on whether to withdraw all military facilities from Panama is still open. Retaining these bases would be a statement that the United States remains determined to safeguard its interests in the region. Congress should press the Administration to maintain a U.S. military presence in Panama.

Backgrounder Update #230<BR>
 7/27/94<BR>
(Updating Backgrounder No. 836, "Women in Combat: Why Rush to
Judgment?" June 14, 1991.)
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Secretary of the Army Togo West announced on June 1 that the Army
soon will reclassify a number of combat assignments to make them
available to women. (Memorandum from the Secretary of the Army for the
Secretary of Defense, "Recommendations for Opening Additional
Positions for Women Under the DOD Assignment Policy -- Decision
Memorandum," June 1, 1994.) Positions as combat engineers, as air
defense artillery specialists, and as pilots and crew members of
helicopters on special operations missions until now have been closed
to women in accordance with long-standing Pentagon regulations. West's
proposals represent a complete reversal of this traditional Army
policy.
<P>
     If the Army brass has its way, however, West's decision will not
stand. He withdrew his proposal after nearly unanimous opposition from
such top Army officers as Chief of Staff General Gordon Sullivan.
(Eric Schmitt, "Generals Oppose Combat By Women," The New York Times,
June 17, 1994, p. A1.) In the words of Sullivan's deputy, General J.H.
Binford Peay III, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on June
16, "I do not think it is appropriate to open up the traditional
positions of infantry, armor, field artillery, engineer at certain
levels of the battlefield, air defense at certain levels of the
battlefield, special operating force aviation, and a few others."
(General J.H. Binford Peay III, USA, testimony before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, June 16, 1994.) It is no surprise that seasoned
military leaders reject West's proposal. Allowing women into these
units would damage the military's hard-earned effectiveness and, for
the first time in U.S. history, deliberately expose women to enemy
fire and extreme risk of death and capture. West is expected to
announce a revised policy later this summer but, in the meantime, is
sticking by his original proposal.
<P>
     Before giving the Secretary of the Army or other Administration
officials free rein to change long-standing U.S. policy toward women
in combat, Congress should learn for itself what such a change of
policy would entail. It could begin by reviewing the findings of the
1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed
Forces, a bipartisan task force appointed by former President George
Bush to examine this issue. After a year's study and hundreds of hours
of hearings, the Commission voted unanimously in November 1993 to
codify into law the Army's existing regulations exempting women from
combat. The Commission also voted nine to four that the existing "risk
rule" regarding non-combat positions be retained. (Presidential
Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, Report to
the President, November 15, 1992, pp. 24-27, 36-37.) 
<P>
     An appropriate forum for review of these and other findings of
the Presidential Commission would be joint hearings by the Senate and
House Armed Services Committees, during which West and other senior
Pentagon Officials should be required to answer a number of
troublesome questions:
<P>
Are women physically suited to the rigors of ground combat?
<P>
How will bearing and raising children affect a woman's readiness to
 deploy on short notice, as is frequently required of military units?
<P>
What are the potential consequences of women and men operating in
 intimate proximity away from home for extended periods of time?
<P>
How do women serving in the armed forces feel about being assigned to
 combat units?
<P>
What has been the experience of nations that have mixed men and women
 in combat units?
<P>

WHAT IS BEHIND THE ARMY'S NEW PUSH FOR WOMEN IN COMBAT?
<P>
     Secretary West's changes in Army assignment policies came in
response to then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's January 1994
decision to loosen the military's long-standing ban on women in
combat. First, Aspin rescinded the so-called risk rule, which
prevented the assignment of women to support units -- engineering,
supply, and military police units, for example -- that operate with
combat forces (such as tanks and infantry) and face a substantial risk
of contact with the enemy. Second, he ordered the armed services to
review their personnel assignment policies. Those jobs that meet the
Pentagon's narrow definition of "direct ground combat" -- "engaging an
enemy on the ground with individual or crew-served weapons [such as
machine guns and rifles], while being exposed to hostile fire and to a
high probability of direct physical contact with the hostile force's
personnel" (Memorandum from the Secretary of Defense to the [Service
Secretaries], Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), and Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Reserve Affairs), "Direct Ground Combat
Definition and Assignment Rule," January 13, 1994.) -- are to remain
closed to women. Positions in units which "routinely collocate" with
direct ground combat forces also are to remain closed, but women are
to be allowed in all other assignments. Secretary West's June 1 memo
is the Army's response to these instructions, which are to take effect
October 1, 1994.
<P>
     Calling Warfare Something Else Does Not Make It Easier or Safer.
The Administration's new definition of "non-combat" positions is both
inaccurate and unrealistic. In his memo, Secretary West explicitly
applies Aspin's definition "strictly as written," meaning that a job
must involve simultaneously "engaging the enemy," "being exposed to
hostile fire," and having "direct physical contact" with the enemy.
However, a soldier facing any one of these conditions surely is
engaged in combat. Moreover, Aspin's definition implies that only
riflemen and machine gunners can be "in combat." But someone can be
"exposed to hostile fire" well outside of rifle range; a soldier can
be killed by an artillery round fired from twenty miles away. And is
"direct physical contact" only actual hand-to-hand combat, or is being
within range of the enemy's hand grenades or pistols "direct" enough?
<P>
     In fine-tuning a definition of combat to suit their political
objective, the Administration is forging neat distinctions which
simply do not exist on the battlefield. Positions like combat engineer
and air defense artillery specialist have been closed to women because
they involve the likelihood of direct exposure to enemy fire. They
also involve operating in proximity to infantry, artillery, and other
combat forces whose sole purpose is to find and destroy the enemy. The
Administration's new rules for combat assignment imply that the enemy
will attack only U.S. forces engaged in "direct ground combat" as
Aspin defines it. At any time, however, those in what the
Administration would call "non-combat" units can be hit by enemy fire,
have physical contact with enemy troops, and otherwise "engage the
enemy." The West memorandum makes clear the Clinton Administration's
intention to open such positions to women without regard for the
realities of the battlefield.
<P>
     The Real Agenda: Career Opportunity Over Military Effectiveness.
The Clinton Administration's real objective in pushing to place women
in harm's way is explicit. Aspin's instructions in January advised the
armed services to "use this guidance to expand opportunities for
women. No units or positions previously open to women will be closed
under these instructions." Aspin further stated that "we've made
historic progress in opening up opportunities for women in all of the
services.... [E]xpanding the roles of women in the military is the
right thing to do, and it's also the smart thing to do." (Eric
Schmitt, "Aspin Moves To Open Many Military Jobs to Women," The New
York Times, January 14, 1994, p. 22.) In his June 1 memorandum, Army
Secretary West echoed this position: "America's Army is proud to be on
the forefront of providing opportunities for women.... [W]e take every
opportunity to enhance the career opportunities of all service
members.... " ("Recommendations for Opening Additional Positions for
Women Under the DOD Assignment Policy -- Decision Memorandum," op.
cit.) One analysis of West's memorandum notes that it "uses phrases
such as 'career opportunity' no less than ten times, but references to
military requirements are conspicuously absent." (Center for Military
Readiness, news release, June 8, 1994.) The Administration claims that
placing women in combat assignments will make the military more
effective, but this claim is not supported by the evidence. It is time
for Congress to examine that evidence.

<P>
QUESTIONS FOR CONGRESS
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is proposing momentous changes in
policy with serious implications for U.S. military effectiveness.
Before changes in current combat restrictions are allowed to take
effect in October, Congress must hold hearings on the role of women in
America's defense. As part of these hearings, Members must ask
Secretary of Defense William Perry, the Secretaries of each of the
armed services, and senior uniformed officers five questions.
<P>
Question #1: Are women physically suited to the rigors of ground
  combat? 
<P>
Answer: The evidence suggests that they are not. In weighing the
ability of women to perform under combat conditions, the 1992
Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
heard testimony from Army Lieutenant Colonel William Gregor, Chairman
of the Department of Military Science at the University of Michigan,
who conducted a test of Army officer candidates and found that:
<P>
The top 20 percent of women at West Point achieved scores on the Army
  Physical Fitness Test equivalent to the bottom 20 percent of male
  cadets.
<P>
Only seven percent of women can meet a score of 60 on the push-up
  test, while 78 percent of men exceed it.
<P>
A 20- to 30-year-old woman has the same aerobic capacity as a 50-year-
  old man.
<P>
Only one woman out of 100 could meet a physical standard achieved by
   60 out of 100 men. Gregor concluded that going through this process
   would mean that "I have just traded off 60 soldiers for the
   prospect of getting one. The cost considerations are prohibitive."
   (Lt. Col. William Gregor, USA, testimony before the Presidential
   Commission, September 12, 1992, cited in the Presidential 
   Commission's Report to the President, November 15, 1992, p. C-42.)
  <P>
     Soldiers under fire must have confidence in the physical
abilities of their comrades. Before allowing women to face the stress
of combat, Congress must hear from Lieutenant Colonel Gregor and other
experts to determine whether women are physically suited for it.
<P>
Question #2: How will bearing and raising children affect a woman's
   readiness to deploy on short notice, as is frequently required of
   military units?
<P>
Answer: Because of pregnancy and family responsibilities, many women
cannot be shipped out to a foreign crisis as quickly as men. During
Operation Desert Storm, for example, enlisted women in the Navy were
unavailable for overseas deployment nearly four times more often than
men. At any given time, between 8 and 10 percent of women in the Navy
are pregnant; (Department of the Navy, Navy Personnel Survey, 1990
Survey Report, Volume 2.) for the Army, the figure is 10 to 15
percent. (Michael Levin, Feminism and Freedom (New Brunswick, NJ:
Transaction Books, 1988), p. 235.) Because Navy regulations require
pregnant sailors to be within six hours of a medical facility, each of
these women must be replaced before a ship can sail. This could lead
to sudden gaps in a small unit that depends on the presence of all
members to complete its mission. Such gaps would damage the cohesion
of a tightly knit combat team.
<P>
     Moreover, this effect will be magnified as the military continues
to shrink under the Clinton Admini-stration's defense budget cuts.
Because it is getting more difficult to attract qualified candidates,
military recruiters are trying to appeal to women with promises of
career advancement. The result is a higher number of women as a
percentage of the total force; while women accounted for only 14.5
percent of Army recruits four years ago, for example, they will
comprise 20.5 percent this year. (Rowan Scarborough, "Military
Recruiters Increasingly Rely on Women to Fill Ranks," The Washington
Times, February 28, 1994, p. A1.) Lower unit readiness caused by the
absence of child-rearing women inevitably will get worse as the
military continues to attract a higher percentage of women its ranks.
<P>
Question #3: What are the potential consequences of women and men
    fighting alongside one another?
<P>
Answer: Combat is a team activity which brings people closer together
than any other profession. A small number of women may possess the
physical and mental toughness to perform some combat duties; but
teamwork matters more than individual capabilities in combat, and this
teamwork generally is undermined by the presence of women. On one
support ship during Operation Desert Storm, 36 of the 360 women on
board -- ten percent -- became pregnant. (Alecia Swasy, "Shipboard
Pregnancies Force the Manly Navy to Cope With Moms," The Wall Street
Journal, October 3, 1991, p. 1.) In a Roper survey conducted during
the Gulf War, 64 percent of military personnel surveyed reported that
sexual activity had taken place in their unit. (The Roper
Organization, "Attitudes Regarding the Assignment of Women in the
Armed Forces: The Military Perspective," September 1992.) Mixing men
and women in military units invites sexual attraction and special
relationships, and these relationships -- or even the perception that
they exist -- destroy the morale and cohesion which any fighting force
must have to win wars. If more women join combat units that become
open to them as a result of the Administration's new policies, this
problem will only worsen.
<P>
Question #4: How do women serving in the armed forces feel about being
   assigned to combat units?
<P>
Answer: In a 1992 survey of Army women, between 70 and 80 percent of
respondents favored allowing women to volunteer for combat. Yet, among
the same respondents, 90 percent of female noncommissioned officers
and 88 percent of enlisted women indicated that they would not
volunteer; only 14 percent of the Army officers surveyed indicated
that they would volunteer for combat assignments. And fully 52 percent
of Army women claimed they would leave the service if women are
compelled to serve in combat. (Laura Miller and Dr. Charles Moskos,
"1992 Survey on Gender in the Military," Northwestern University,
September 1992.) 
<P>
     The charge that barring women from combat units inhibits their
career advancement is groundless. According to Department of Defense
statistics, even with the combat exclusion for women, the services are
promoting females at similar or faster rates than males. (Department
of Defense, "Military Women in the Department of Defense," Volume
VIII, July 1990, pp. 30, 73.) Expanding combat "opportunities" places
the aspirations of feminist activists ahead of the wishes of most
military women, who have expressed consistently strong personal
resistance to being assigned to combat.
<P>
Question #5: What has been the experience of nations that have mixed
   men and women in combat units?
<P>
Answer: History shows that the presence of women has had a devastating
impact on the effectiveness of men in battle. For example, it is a
common misperception that Israel allows women in combat units. In
fact, women have been barred from combat in Israel since 1950, when a
review of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War showed how harmful their presence
could be. The study revealed that men tried to protect and assist
women rather than continue their attack. As a result, they not only
put their own lives in greater danger, but also jeopardized the
survival of the entire unit. The study further revealed that unit
morale was damaged when men saw women killed and maimed on the
battlefield. (Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces, International Trip Report, September 14-27, 1992.)
These findings will come as no surprise to most Americans; in a recent
national survey, two-thirds of those who favored the current policy
barring women from ground combat cited the potential loss of mens'
effectiveness as a reason. (The Roper Organization, "Attitudes
Regarding the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces: The Public
Perspective," September 1992, p. 41.)
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The American people know that the purpose of the armed forces is
to fight and win the nation's wars, not to serve as a laboratory for
social "progress." While the military attempts to provide servicemen
and women with rewarding careers, it must not do so at the expense of
its readiness for war. Most Americans understand that the majority of
men are physically stronger than the majority of women and that the
risk of sexual attraction can undermine the cohesion and discipline
necessary for success on the battlefield. Most are also uncomfor with
the deliberate exposure of women to violence. Unfortunately, their
common sense is not shared by the Clinton Administration, which
already has shown a lack of sound military judgment regarding the
assignment of known homosexuals to the armed forces, the use of force
in Somalia, and the military build-up around Haiti.
<P>
     When their very existence was threatened, many nations -- Israel
during its 1948 war for independence, and both the Soviet Union and
Nazi Germany near the end of World War II -- used women in combat,
removing them when the crisis passed. The U.S. faces no such threat
today; moreover, thousands of qualified men and women are leaving the
military as it gets smaller. The facts demonstrate that placing women
in or near combat units will damage military effectiveness. Weakening
America's military might in this way and at this time is particularly
troubling. The U.S. armed services already are suffering from deep
budget cuts and declining morale. (For a discussion of the military
budget crisis, see John Luddy, "Stop the Slide Toward a Hollow
Military," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 209, January
14, 1994, and Baker Spring, "Fixing The 1995 Defense Budget," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 227, June 22, 1994.) By holding
hearings to examine the wisdom of the Clinton Administration's change
in policy, Congress can stop the Administration from using the
military as a laboratory for social engineering.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration wants the Senate to ratify quickly the
Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty negotiated during the heady
early days of the "new world order" and signed by the United States on
January 13, 1993.  So far, the Chemical Weapons Convention has been
signed by 157 countries.  It will enter into force and become
recognized international law when 65 countries have ratified it and
deposited the signed and ratified documents with the Office of the
United Nations Secretary General in New York.
<P>
     Hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have
begun, and Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-RI) has said he hopes for a full
Senate vote by July 15.  But there is cause for concern that the
Chemical Weapons Convention will not fulfill its promise of
eliminating chemical weapons worldwide.  No country is required to
join the convention.  Syria and North Korea, two suspected chemical
weapons developers, have indicated they will not.  Further, the
treaty's verification procedures, although highly intrusive, are still
inadequate to catch governments determined to cheat.  In the end, the
Chemical Weapons Convention will only deceive law-abiding countries
like the United States into believing the chemical weapons threat has
been eliminated.
<P>
     Worse, the treaty creates a large international bureaucracy with
the authority to conduct highly intrusive inspections for chemical
weapons on the territory of treaty participants.  This bureaucracy,
likely to be a cross between the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, will be granted
unimpeded access to American chemical manufacturing plants and
facilities, even if they are not suspected of producing chemical
weapons.  For example, inspections may be performed on facilities that
process or consume, as well as produce, certain types of chemicals
that may be used in weapons.  Some of these chemicals are found in
fertilizers and pesticides.  Thus, an agricultural facility that uses
certain types of fertilizers or pesticides may be subject to
inspection.  Dealing with these inspections undoubtedly will impose
heavy additional costs on U.S.  chemical companies.
<P>
     In fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent for
international treaties, the Senate should answer a series of basic
questions before determining the value of this or any treaty.  For
example, does the agreement: 
<P>
* contribute to U.S.  national security? 
<P>
* reduce the risk of war? 
<P>
* leave America with a military force commensurate with its global
  obligations?
<P>
* lend itself to verification? 
<P>
*  have adequate enforcement mechanisms? 
<P>
     In the case of the Chemical Weapons Convention, none of these
questions can be answered with enough certainty to justify the risk of
ratifying it.  In order to protect the interests of the United States,
the Senate should:
<P>
Demand a new treaty be drafted that is modeled on the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty.  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
    designates certain countries, such as the U.S., as states that are
    permitted to deploy nuclear weapons.  The Senate should press the
    Administration to withdraw the Chemical Weapons Convention and
    begin a new round of negotiations at the United Nations Conference
    on Disarmament to draft a new Chemical Weapons Convention.  The
    new agreement should permit the U.S.  to maintain a chemical
    stockpile as a deterrent to such known chemical weapons states as 
    Russia, Iraq, and North Korea.  Taking this approach also would
    exempt the U.S.  from intrusive inspections by international
    bureaucrats.
<P>
Establish a new policy for deterring chemical weapons strikes.  In May
    1991, President George Bush announced a decision to halt U.S. 
    production of new chemical munitions, eliminate existing U.S. 
    chemical weapons stockpiles, and foreswear the use of chemical
    weapons under any circumstances.  This step reversed existing U.S. 
    policy of threatening to respond in kind to a chemical attack. 
    The U.S.  should declare a new deterrence policy toward chemical
    weapons that resembles the one that existed prior to Bush's
    announcement.  This will require that the U.S.  retain chemical
    munitions.  Further, the U.S.  should declare that under
    extraordinary circumstances it reserves the right to respond to a
    chemical attack with nuclear weapons. 
<P>
Improve U.S.  defenses against chemical weapons.  The Chemical Weapons
    Convention will not protect U.S.  forces against chemical attack. 
    Outlaw nations will continue to produce and stockpile such
    weapons.  Given these circumstances, the U.S.  will need not only
    to maintain a chemical deterrent, but also to possess defenses
    against chemical weapons.  These should include sensors capable of
    detecting the presence of chemicals in the atmosphere, gas masks
    and protective clothing, missiles and aircraft capable of
    destroying chemical weapons delivery vehicles, and training for
    troops who may have to operate in a contaminated environment.
  <P>
Enhance the U.S.  ability to destroy not only chemical weapons on the
    battlefield, but their production and storage facilities as well. 
    In addition to relying on deterrence and defenses to counter
    chemical weapons, U.S.  armed forces need to be able to destroy
    chemical weapons production and storage facilities.  The same
    pertains to enemy forces deployed with chemical munitions.  Thus,
    Air Force and Navy attack forces must have enhanced capabilities
    to conduct strike missions against chemical forces and facilities
    in ways that limit contamination.
<P>
Strengthen arms control enforcement mechanisms.  One of the reasons
    that arms control agreements can pose such a threat to U.S. 
    security is that a policy of strict enforcement is lacking. 
    Absent such a policy, the Chemical Weapons Convention is likely to
    be unenforceable.  In part, this is because the convention puts
    enforcement powers in the hands of the United Nations Security
    Council.  The impact of this weakness could be lessened by
    designating the five permanent members of the Security Council as
    weapons states under the convention.  Otherwise, full enforcement
    of the convention will require that these states, each of which
    has the power to veto any enforcement resolution, find themselves
    in violation of the convention's terms.
<P>
THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
<P>
     It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and
stockpiling of chemical weapons.  Among the earliest attempts in
modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague
Convention.  Approved by the European powers, the convention
prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread
use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition
had little effect. (Mark C.  Storella, Poisoning Arms Control:  The
Soviet Union and Chemical/Biological Weapons (Washington, D.C.: 
Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, 1984), pp.  4-5.)  After the
war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve
the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological
and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production,
and stockpiling.  Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were
the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan.  Unlike the 1907
Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke
out.  Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but
this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders,
particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any
chemical attack. (Roosevelt stated the following on June 8, 1943, when
there were reports that the Axis powers were considering the use of
poison gas:  "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general
opinion of civilized mankind.  This country has not used, and I hope
that we never will be compelled to use them.  I state categorically
that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons
unless they are first used by our enemies.")  It is one of history's
clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<P>
      The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S.  honors its
terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975.  It is,
however, a weak agreement.  If countries violate it, they remain
unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining
the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. 
It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because
participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as
biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first.  Some
states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the
reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked
first.
<P>
     Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several
occasions since the end of World War II.  The Soviet Union and its
clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow
rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the
1970s and 1980s, (Alexander M.  Haig, Jr., Chemical Warfare in
Southeast Asia and Afghanistan (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
State, 1982).) and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year
war with Iran in the 1980s. (W.  Seth Carus, "Chemical Weapons in the
Middle East," Policy Focus, The Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, December 1988, p.  4.)
<P>
     Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in
1971 when the U.N.  Conference on Disarmament's predecessor
organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to
conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. 
This allowed for the conclusion of the Biological Weapons Convention,
which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin
weapons in 1972, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the
back burner for well over a decade.
<P>
     By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern
over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing
a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S.  military.  The
subsequent U.S.  program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol
outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and
stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<P>
     Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of
chemical weapons to Third World countries.  In 1984, Australia
proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could
be used to manufacture chemical weapons.  This proposal was made to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an
organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic
development policies for the Third World.  The Australians wanted
participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem
the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third
World.  Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to
individual governments.  The "Australia Group" now has 20 members,
including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and
Japan. (The Australia Group includes Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Holland,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.) 
<P>
     The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has
limited its effectiveness.  For example, the enforcement of the export
restrictions falls to individual member governments, but
industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they
enforce export restrictions.  In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum
Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol
(used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, (Gary Thatcher and
Timothy Aeppel, "The Trail to Samarra," The Christian Science Monitor,
December 13, 1988, p.  B-1.) and Britain is reported to have sold
thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. (Ralph
Atkins, et al., "Britain Exported Poisonous Gas Ingredients to Iraq,"
The Financial Times, July 29, 1991, p.  1.)  Both transfers were
contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the
Australia Group.  Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by
themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<P>
     Bush's Drive to Ban Chemical Weapons. George Bush came to office
determined to ban chemical weapons.  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce
the chemical stockpiles of the U.S.  and the Soviet Union to 5,000
metric tons each.  No accord, however, was reached outlining
inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. 
That was left to subsequent negotiations which were supposed to be
completed by December 31, 1990.  This deadline passed without
agreement between Moscow and Washington.  The failure was, to some
extent, due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing
politically.  Further, both sides were aware that progress was being
made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N.  Conference on
Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection
procedures and ban the weapons entirely. 
<P>
     Nevertheless, Bush announced on May 13, 1991, in the flush of
America's post-Desert Storm success, that the U.S.  would agree to a
complete ban of chemical weapons even if other nations did not
eliminate their arsenals.  Bush also pledged that the U.S.  would
foreswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances,
including situations in which U.S.  forces are attacked with such
weapons first. (The White House, The Weekly Compilation of
Presidential Documents, Vol.  27, No.  20 (May 20, 1991), pp. 
599-600.)
<P>
     Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use
chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a
chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible
retaliation.  This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with
another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere"
inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical
Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track.  The final draft of
the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva and was
signed in Paris by more than the required 65 countries.  Assuming
these 65 countries ratify the convention by July 1994, it will take
effect on January 13, 1995.  Thus far, only seven (Albania, Australia,
Fiji, Mauritius, Norway, the Seychelles, and Sweden) have ratified the
convention; many are waiting for the U.S.  to ratify before they act. 
<P>

 PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     The purpose of the convention is to ban all existing chemical
weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.  It would
do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all
chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters
into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons
production facilities within the same ten-year period.  The
convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic
chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form
toxic chemicals), or facilities or precursors that are used for
peaceful purposes.  Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may
be retained for developing defenses against chemical weapons.  These
chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to
verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into
weapons.  The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed
to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<P>
     Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large
international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N.  agency that fosters
cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  In a
similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created and
called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. 
The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the
representatives of all states participating in the convention.  It
will establish general policies for implementing the convention and
oversee the functions of the organization.  The second will be the
Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting
of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve
geographic balance.  The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led
by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the
inspections to verify compliance. 
<P>
     The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for
the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at
The Hague.  Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused
on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of
the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes
into force.  Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have
included finding a building to house the agency, establishing
inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and
testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors.  The
1994 budget for the Preparatory Commission is almost $30 million, of
which the U.S.  will pay 25 percent. (Keir A.  Lieber, "Highlights of
the Fifth PrepCom Plenary," The CWC Chronicle, January 1994, p.  1.) 
Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons will operate at a minimum cost of $500 million annually -- but
could wind up costing three to four times this amount, depending on
the number of employees it hires.
<P>
     The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat
are vast.  The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification
(Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of
inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons
production facilities are destroyed.  The Technical Secretariat also
is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities
are not used to develop and produce weapons.  The Verification Annex
outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of
inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and
immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the
equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<P>
     The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of
inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical
Secretariat.  The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical
weapons are destroyed.  The second is to verify the destruction or
conversion of chemical weapons production facilities.  The third,
fourth, and fifth detect whether certain types of chemicals have been
used in building chemical weapons. (Detecting the so-called diversion
of chemicals for use in weapons is complex.  First of all, chemicals
are broken into three categories called schedules.  Schedule I
chemicals are those most easily used in weapons and therefore subject
to the strictest types of inspections.  Schedule II and Schedule III
chemicals are more difficult to turn into weapons and therefore
subject to less strict inspections.)
<P>
     The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities
that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. 
The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice
inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the
convention.  The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites
where chemical weapons may have been used.
<P>
     At first, the U.S.  demanded that so-called challenge inspections
be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected.  It
ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for
so-called managed access to suspect sites.  Under this provision, the
inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long
as it does not involve evading the convention's terms.  In order to
protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers,
shroud displays and equipment, log off computers, restrict the types
of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent
samples, and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular
areas at a suspect site.
<P>
     The inspection process is long and involved.  It starts with OPCW
officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as
weapons sites.  The declaration must be filed with the Technical
Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into
force.  Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must
begin within two years.  They must be completely destroyed within ten
years.
<P>
     Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and
monitoring devices to guard against a violation.  Similar procedures,
such as placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether or not the
chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical
production facilities have been destroyed.  As many as 1,000
inspections a year may be required.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on
compliance.  The Executive Council bears the responsibility for
demanding that a participating state redress a violation.  If
corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may
suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention.  This
could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in
developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the
right to vote in the Conference of State Parties.  In more serious
cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken.  For
example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut
off.  In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other
states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the
United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security
Council.  Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of
final appeal in the enforcement process.
<P>

FIVE FLAWS IN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     There are five flaws in the Chemical Weapons Convention which
must be considered as the Senate gives its advise and consent.
<P>
FLAW #1: The CWC does not enhance U.S.  national security. 
<P>
     Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of
national security.  It should never be thought of as an end in itself. 
Reduced arsenals are not always better.  A comprehensive security
strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and
even offensive military operations, as well as arms control.  In
short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of
foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic
test.  The convention requires that the U.S.  completely abandon its
chemical deterrent, but this will not enhance U.S.  security.  Since
no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly
legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons.  And
since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain
chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global
chemical disarmament.  It makes no sense for America to give up its
chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<P>
FLAW #2: The CWC will not reduce the risk of war. 
<P>
     Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of
arms control.  Reducing the risk of war is far more important.  Arms
control agreements should not be destabilizing.  It is
counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by
reducing arms, only invites attack.
<P>
     Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will
do.  The CWC is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of
armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security, but
the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can
deter a chemical attack.  If the U.S.  bans all of its chemical
weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military
advantage.
<P>
     Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of
preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of
violence, but the Chemical Weapons Convention will encourage
escalation in two ways.  First, a chemically armed enemy, knowing that
the U.S.  and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have
little incentive to refrain from using such weapons.  They will enjoy
a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are
likely to use it.  Second, the convention may increase the likelihood
that nuclear weapons will be used.  Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. 
will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack
on U.S.  forces.  While it is prudent to reserve the right to use
nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the
threshold of nuclear war.
<P>
FLAW #3: The CWC ignores America's global responsibilities.
<P>
     With the Cold War over, the U.S.  is the world's sole superpower. 
Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the
U.S.  can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of
projecting overwhelming force around the globe.  Because America has
these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case
in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This amounts to an
international stamp of approval for America's nuclear arsenal.
<P>
     The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons
arsenal.  In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. 
has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power
in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate
interests of other states.  But America's global responsibilities also
mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major
conflicts.  The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood
that chemical weapons will be used against U.S.  forces.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special
responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same
manner.  It assumes that U.S.  troops face the same likelihood of
chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica,
which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty.  In this
way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control
agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty in which the U.S.  and four other nations (Britain, China,
France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different
from all other nations.  The NPT accounts for the special
responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five
acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs.  The Chemical
Weapons Convention should do so as well, by naming the same five
countries as weapons states.
<P>
FLAW #4: Compliance with the CWC cannot be verified. 
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. 
Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to
keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an
impossible task.  In a devastating report prepared for the Defense
Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated:  "Detecting most types of
cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be
highly unlikely, if not impossible." (Kathleen Bailey, et al.,
"Noncompliance Scenarios:  Means By Which Parties To The Chemical
Weapons Convention Might Cheat," August 1991.  The same report
outlines several scenarios for future cheating under the convention. 
One posits that a country possessing a commercial plant that produces
hydrogen cyanide, a lethal chemical, diverts some to underground tanks
as a strategic reserve for later weaponization.  Another scenario
posits that a country builds a clandestine facility to produce the
nerve agent tabun, stores the agent in bulk, and then destroys the
facility and decontaminates the site.)
<P>
     Unable to verify whether a hostile country is cheating, the U.S. 
would never know with certainty what kind of chemical weapons threat
it faced.  As a result, the U.S.  would run the risk of high combat
casualties as it was surprised by attacks with chemical weapons U.S. 
leaders did not even know existed.
<P>
FLAW #5:  Violations will go unpunished. 
<P>
     Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not
enough.  The U.S.  also must be able to do something if other
countries are caught violating the agreement.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to
address the question of enforcement.  It states that unspecified
sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention
either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or
by the United Nations.  Ultimately, the United Nations Security
Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the
behavior of an outlaw state.
<P>
     The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an
object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement.  Starting in
the early 1980s, the U.S.  acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet
Union of violating the BWC.  Yet the U.S.  never lodged a complaint
with the U.N.  Security Council, which is charged with resolving the
BWC's enforcement problems.  The reason for this inaction is clear: 
If the U.S.  had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow
simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the
U.N.  Security Council. 
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention would have the same flaws as the
Biological Weapons Convention, and international politics would make
it impossible to enforce its provisions.
<P>

TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY:THREE PRINCIPLES
<P>
     The U.S.  has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of
chemical weapons around the world, but an effective counter-
proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone.  A truly
effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective
chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying
chemical weapons facilities.  As the Senate considers the merits of
the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of
an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on these three
principles. 
<P>
PRINCIPLE #1:  The need to deter a chemical attack.
<P>
     Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate
for chemical attacks against the U.S.  or its allies.  This
retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor
that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S.  with chemical
weapons.
<P>
     By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical
Weapons Convention would deny the U.S.  the capability to retaliate in
kind for a chemical attack.  America would be left with only two
options in case of a chemical attack:  1) to escalate the conflict by
launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical
and non-nuclear) arms or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons.  But
the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to
deal with these options.  Not only is it cutting the conventional
forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that
nuclear weapons have any role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<P>
PRINCIPLE #2:  The need for defenses against chemical weapons. 
<P>
     There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always
work.  Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not
act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint.  Therefore, the U.S. 
needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it
needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. 
U.S.  forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and
decontamination kits, and the American people need to be defended as
well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<P>
     There is certainly room for improvement in chemical defenses. 
The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard
Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's
soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct
operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons.
(Richard Davis, "Soldiers Not Adequately Trained or Equipped to
Conduct Operations on a Chemical Battlefield," testimony before the
House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Readiness, April 16,
1991.)  As for defenses against missiles armed with chemical weapons,
the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile
defense program by more than 50 percent.
<P>
     Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons
Convention will make it politically difficult to field better
defenses.  In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S.  would
foreswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation
for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972.  After the Nixon
decision, the U.S.  biological defense program withered.  This outcome
was not a result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention
outlawing defenses; it was a result of constant criticism of these
programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the
spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention.

<P>
     The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention
surfaced during the Persian Gulf War.  An interim report to Congress
on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological
defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used
biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the
casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care
system. (Department of Defense, Conduct of the Persian Gulf Conflict,
An Interim Report to Congress (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1991), p.  6-6.) 
<P>
     This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to
be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The
CWC does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are
sure to lobby against defenses, arguing that they will not be needed
because chemical weapons have been banned, at least legally.
<P>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.
<P>
     Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a
chemical attack.  U.S.  armed forces can preemptively destroy an
enemy's chemical weapons with air strikes and other forms of offensive
combat operations.  Targets for such strikes should include chemical
production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with
chemical munitions.  Destruction of the production facilities and
storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and
targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the
chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S.  and allied
forces.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should devise a comprehensive strategy
for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war.  It can do
so by continuing and improving a Pentagon program already underway. 
The Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has
a program called Warbreaker, the aim of which is to devise a
comprehensive system for directing Air Force, Army, and Navy attacks
against enemy chemical forces within minutes.  The Warbreaker program
also needs to include among the targets it is being designed to
destroy those that support, either directly or indirectly, chemical
attacks.
<P>
REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement.  Likewise,
the existing U.S.  policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. 
Neither is the fault of the Clinton Administration.  The decisions to
conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S.  policy toward
countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration apparently does not plan
to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration.  As the
Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to
the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt
a different approach.  It can do so through the advice and consent
process established by the United States Constitution for approving
the ratification of treaties.  As it does so, it should consider that:
<P>
A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty. 
<P>
      Two treaties serve as models for agreements on weapons of mass
destruction throughout the world:  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<P>
     The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty.  It
seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all
participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy
biological weapons.  But it is now known that the BWC has been
violated by the Soviet Union since its inception.  Further, a report
issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in January 1993
states that China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Taiwan either
definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention.
(Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, "Adherence To and Compliance
With Arms Control Agreements and the President's Report to Congress on
Soviet Noncompliance With Arms Control Agreements," January 14, 1993,
pp.  14-15.)  In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to
determine with absolute precision because compliance with the
convention cannot be verified.  However, while other countries
retained biological weapons, the U.S.  completely destroyed its
biological deterrent. 
<P>
     The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been
relatively successful.  While it has not prevented the spread of
nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly.  Today
only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states
have nuclear weapons.  More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty
did not require the elimination of the U.S.  nuclear deterrent. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the
problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by referring the treaty
to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted.  The
Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step.  The
Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed.  If
this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the
Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the CWC. 
<P>
     If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second
alternative available to the Senate.  The advice and consent process
used by the Senate to grant permission to ratify a treaty is not
limited to approving or disapproving ratification.  The Senate can
amend the text of a treaty.  Through this amendment process, the
Senate can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention itself so that it
resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Doing so will require
amending the convention in several articles.  After adopting these
amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification.  The
practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have
to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the
Senate.  Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the
treaty.
<P>
A new policy is needed for deterring chemical weapons strikes. 
<P>
     Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will
not address the threat to U.S.  security posed by chemical weapons. 
This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy
adopted by the Bush Administration.  The policy established by
President Bush on May 13, 1991, committed the U.S.  to the
unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal.  This policy should
be dropped, and the U.S.  should announce that it will reserve the
right to retaliate with nuclear weapons if it or its allies are
attacked with chemical weapons.  Such a response should be considered
only in the most extreme circumstance when it clearly would save the
lives of many U.S.  and allied troops and civilians. 
<P>
     While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make
these changes in U.S.  chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can
take actions that could result in the same changes.  First, the
Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. 
chemical deterrent.  Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a
means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification --
that declares that the U.S.  reserves the option of retaliating
against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. (Adopting such a
reservation would require that the Senate strike Article XXII of the
treaty.  Article XXII prohibits reservations of this sort.  Striking
Article XXII, however, may be something the Senate has an interest in
doing whether or not it adopts the reservation concerning nuclear
retaliation.  The tool most frequently used by the Senate in its
advice and consent process is adopting reservations, and Article XXII
represents a direct assault on the prerogatives of the Senate.)
<P>
U.S.  defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. 
<P>
     Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the
Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted.  In fact, the
convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defensive
programs.  The danger is that the implementation process will be
hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who
will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration can counter these pressures on U.S. 
chemical defense programs in three ways.  First, it can request
adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs.  At a minimum,
the Administration should pledge to hold chemical defense funding
levels in real terms at the fiscal 1993 level of $600 million in each
of the next five years.  This will send a message that adoption of the
Chemical Weapons Convention, in whatever form, does not mean weakening
this country's commitment to fielding defensive systems.  The money
could be used to develop such defensive equipment as improved gas
masks, protective garments, and chemical detectors. 
<P>
     Second, the Administration should move to improve training for
U.S.  soldiers, so they are better prepared to conduct operations in a
contaminated environment.  This requires that military officers follow
the recommendations made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting
Office in testimony before Congress. (Davis, op.  cit.)  These include
meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service
regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into
the overall training program for U.S.  troops. 
<P>
     Third, the Administration should pledge to improve U.S.  defenses
against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks.  In most
cases, these delivery vehicles are aircraft and missiles.  Living up
to this pledge will require moving toward deployment of the Corps
Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) air defense system and the F-22 fighter
and fielding effective defenses against short-range missiles by 1996
and long-range missiles by 2002.  The Senate could force these
outcomes by adopting reservations requiring the Administration to meet
these goals as the price for ratifying the convention.
<P>
The U.S.  capability to destroy chemical weapons production and
    storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical
    weapons, should be improved. 
<P>
     Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending
U.S.  and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack.  These
can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at
enemy positions.  For example, countering enemy artillery firing
chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing
artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and
control networks and destroying chemical production and supply
facilities.
<P>
     The U.S.  proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an
effective deep strike capability.  Many command and control centers,
for example, were destroyed by U.S.  air power in and around Baghdad. 
But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made.  For example,
the U.S.  had trouble countering Iraqi mobile Scud missiles with air
power.  To deal with this problem, the Pentagon launched the
Warbreaker program, which is focused on enhancing the U.S.  ability to
strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities.  While
recognizing that this program's applications go far beyond countering
chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration should announce that it
backs Warbreaker in part as a way to strike preemptively at weapons
capable of delivering chemical munitions.  The Senate again has the
option of adopting a reservation during its advice and consent process
that will force the Administration to continue the Warbreaker program
and gear it to meeting the chemical weapons threat.
<P>
The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms
     need to be strengthened. 
<P>
     There are three problems with U.S.  policy for enforcing
compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.  First, the Chemical
Weapons Convention has a built in conflict of interest in terms of
enforcement.  By establishing the U.N.  Security Council as the court
of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow
the U.N.  Security Council's five permanent members to veto any
pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged
violation.  Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example
-- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<P>
     This problem can be resolved through a proposal to redraft the
Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty.  Since the redrafted convention would establish
declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these
states be the five permanent members of the U.N.  Security Council,
thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<P>
     The second enforcement problem is that the U.S.  historically has
been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control
treaty partner.  Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the
Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, the U.S.  did not in either case take the proportionate steps
allowed to it under international law.  Thus, the violations
effectively went unpunished. 
<P>
     Solving this problem will require a change in the government
process for handling these issues.  Currently, the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations,
but there is no requirement for follow-up.  Ultimately, the law could
be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate
response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after
the report is issued.  This would guarantee a substantive response
once a violation is discovered. 
<P>
     The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse
to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  This can be
dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter
and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the
Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including
the U.S., are weapons states.  It also requires a policy under which
the U.S.  reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical
attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons.
<P>
     Perhaps the best example of a successful deterrence policy in
history came during World War II.  Despite the existence of chemical
arsenals, chemical weapons were not used during that conflict.  The
reason:  the Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the
Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<P>
     The U.S.  is now throwing away this successful policy.  By
adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention, the U.S.  would eliminate
its chemical arsenals, even though it could never be sure that
potential enemies have done so.  U.S.  national security interests
demand that this process be reversed.  The U.S.  must not abandon its
ability to defend itself against chemical attack -- and to deter such
attacks in the first place.

     In the months of controversy since President Bill Clinton pledged
to end the military's ban against homosexuals, this ill-considered
idea has been widely rejected. It is clear that the campaign to allow
homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces is failing. Last week,
following an exhaustive study, the Pentagon once again concluded that
"homosexuality is incompatible with military service." 
<P>
     The same study nevertheless proposes a policy that allows
homosexuals to serve if they keep their lifestyle private. Dubbed
"don't ask, don't tell," it is unclear if the policy has the support
of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, who is holding
hearings to determine whether the current ban should be upheld,
altered, or abolished. "Don't ask, don't tell" is a compromise that
would prevent recruiters from screening homosexuals at the point of
enlistment, and might restrict the services' ability to investigate
evidence of homosexuality. Either way, the armed services would be
disrupted as commanders scrambled to deal with a fundamental
contradiction: a policy that claims that "homosexuality is
incompatible with military service," yet tacitly allows homosexuals to
serve so long as their sexual activity is private. This is a
politically expedient solution that will almost certainly subject
future presidential candidates to pressure for further compromise from
activists who are unhappy with "don't ask, don't tell."
<P>
     A policy based on contradictions is bound to fail. Congress
should resolve this issue by passing a law affirming that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service, and giving
military commanders authority to screen and discharge homosexuals
under any circumstances. 
<P>
     Sound Reasons. There are three detrimental effects of homosexuals
in the armed services that form the basis for the ban. They are:
<P>
1)   Unit cohesion is weakened. 
  <P>   Unit cohesion is the social bond that gives rise to that
intangible feeling which causes a man to dive on a grenade to save his
buddies, or to risk his life simply because his leader tells him to.
It requires the soldier to place the needs of the unit ahead of his
self-interest and individual identity. He will do this, however, only
if he trusts that his comrades and commanders are doing likewise.
While cohesion requires a strong degree of mutual affection, sexual
emotions are rooted strongly in self-interest. They can be distracting
and even disruptive, and often lie beneath the surface, not indicated
by any overt action or statement. 
<P>
2)   Professionalism is undermined. 
<P>     The presence of homosexuals in the armed services threatens the
military's highly regarded merit-based system. Sexual attraction
encourages special relationships without regard to rank and increases
the risk of favoritism. Political activism elsewhere in society
suggests that weakening the ban would be followed by quotas and
lawsuits if homosexuals were not promoted in representative numbers.
This would destroy the cohesion of a military unit, and erode the
military's successful merit-based promotion system.
<P>
3)   The risk of AIDS in the services is increased. 
<P>     Homosexuals contract HIV, the human immuno-deficiency virus, at
thousands of times the rate of heterosexuals and, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control, two-thirds of U.S. AIDS cases are
found among homosexual men. Testing is imperfect, and may not reveal
the presence of HIV for months. During combat, individuals are exposed
routinely to the blood of others, and frequently require battlefield
transfusions from their fellow soldiers. If the "don't ask, don't
tell" compromise allows off-base, off-duty homosexual sex, will a
soldier hesitate to help a wounded homosexual soldier who may have
contracted HIV since his last test? Should battlefield medical
personnel proceed directly to a heterosexual soldier after treating a
homosexual's open wound? Military men and women willingly accept risks
not found anywhere else in society, but should they be needlessly
exposed to a disease that is 100 percent fatal and has no known cure?
Even the Red Cross does not allow homosexuals to donate blood.
<P>
     These sound reasons against allowing homosexuals in the armed
services are easily understood by the American people. Indeed, most
Americans  hold the sensible view that the purpose of the military is
to win wars, not to conduct liberal social experiments. In a recent
Gallup poll, Americans supported the ban by 53 percent, compared to 35
percent opposed.
<P>
     As most Americans understand, the issue is not one of fairness,
but of military effectiveness. The armed forces exist to wage war. War
is fought by units, not by individuals. Units function best when
differences among individuals are kept to a minimum. When units
function well, fewer Americans die. It is not fair to risk the lives
of American soldiers and sailors merely to accommodate the sexual
lifestyles of certain individuals.  
<P>
     Life in the military is indeed unique. Soldiers and sailors have
little choice about whom they work with or where they live. They are
part of a chain of command 24 hours a day. The commander's
responsibility for everything the unit does or fails to do never ends;
the now-infamous Tailhook scandal, in which dozens of officers were
disciplined for sexual misconduct during an off-duty event, proves
that military people are never off duty enough to escape the
consequences of their actions. This kind of accountability is rare in
society, but it is absolutely essential to military effectiveness. 
<P>
     Ask the Question. Behind the "don't ask, don't tell" policy is a
misguided assumption: that homosexual military personnel will abstain
from sexual activity. Proponents of this policy argue that what
matters is not whether someone is homosexual, but whether he or she
engages in homosexual behavior. But this is a distinction without a
difference. Is it reasonable to assume that homosexuals will not
engage in homosexual behavior? Do proponents of this proposal really
expect homosexuals to become celibate for the duration of their stay
in the armed services -- an expectation no one would reasonably have
for heterosexual recruits? 
<P>
     If it is reasonable to assume that homosexuals engage in behavior
which is "incompatible with military service," why not screen recruits
in advance in an attempt to limit that behavior? Acknowledging one's
homosexuality prior to induction does not result in criminal
prosecution or any infringement of rights; it simply denies the
homosexual the opportunity to be a soldier. Other behavior that harms
military effectiveness, such as drug abuse and sexual harassment, is
not tolerated in private; there is no reason why homosexuality should
be dealt with differently. 
<P>
     If homosexuality is incompatible with military service, it should
be prohibited outright. Looking the other way when homosexuals seek to
join the armed forces sends the message that they are welcome so long
as they remain celibate -- or do not get caught. Such a policy is
disingenuous and unrealistic.
<P>
     Endangering American troops just to placate those who promote a
homosexual lifestyle is irresponsible. Allowing homosexuals to serve
under any conditions would jeopardize U.S. troops, military readiness,
and the nation's security and prosperity. Congress should heed the
sound arguments for excluding homosexual Americans from the military.
It should end the use of this issue as a political football by passing
a strict version of the ban into law.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Later this month, members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee will begin filling in the details of the $245 billion package of tax relief approved in the FY 1996 budget resolution. In addition to finding the savings needed to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2002, the budget resolution requires an additional $75 billion in savings, which combined with the estimated $170 billion "fiscal dividend" produced by the balanced budget plan, is sufficient to finance a substantial package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate economic growth.
<p>
Congress must now determine how to allocate a limited pool of $245 billion in tax relief. The committees should begin this process by using the $354 billion House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package. Because the House plan contains roughly $110 billion more tax relief than is now available under the conference agreement, the committees must use some criteria for narrowing their choices. While each of the tax relief proposals in the House-passed plan addresses particular inequities in the tax code or specific weaknesses in the economy, some of the proposals have additional qualities that should make them top priorities for inclusion in the final package.
<p>
The cornerstones of the House-passed plan, which also should form the cornerstones of the new tax relief package, are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>$500 per child tax credit, 

<li>Reduction of the capital gains tax, and 

<li>An IRA-Plus plan. 
</ul><p>
These tax relief proposals have been the core of the House plan because they provide direct tax relief to American families and they would do most to spur economic growth. The other tax cuts in the House plan are far more targeted in their impact on various taxpayers or far more limited in their impact on the economy. To be sure, these other tax cuts are important, but their inclusion in the final tax cut package will rest on the relative merits of each proposal. 
<p>
In the final analysis, however, the answer involves an important and fundamental decision by Congress about who should control spending -- the government or taxpayers. That is why both tax and spending reductions are needed to effectively move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands of ordinary citizens. By including tax relief in this year's budget, Congress is allowing American taxpayers, rather than the government, to keep and spend more of the money they earn.
<p>
<b>Relief for Families.</b> Most important, American families must share in the savings from reduced government spending. Families also are more likely to support such reductions, for example, if they know they can keep $500 for each dependent child. This is especially true as Congress is considering substantial reforms in welfare. For working families earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, the $500 per child tax credit (giving a family of four a $1,000 tax cut) will eliminate their entire income tax burden. Indeed, these families would need less government assistance if they did not have to send so much of the money they earn to Washington in taxes. 
<p>
These overtaxed families can also be turned into a powerful constituency for smaller government if Congress directly links the benefits of balancing the budget to family tax relief. The families of 52 million children, or 35 million working families, would be eligible for the $500 per child tax credit. Taking money away from wasteful government programs and placing it in the pockets of working families gives these taxpayers a stake in the budget process and the incentive to stand up to the advocates of big government.
<p>
Overall, the House-passed plan is very "family-friendly," since some 65 percent of all tax relief will go to families or seniors. About 35 percent of the tax relief will benefit the business or investment communities, contributing to economic growth through job creation. Some of the tax relief targeted to "business," such as reductions in estate and gift taxes, also will benefit owners of family businesses and farms. As they craft a new tax relief plan, the House and Senate committees would be wise to maintain the "family-friendly" nature of the House plan by keeping the relative ratio of tax relief targeted to families and to economic growth and businesses.
<p>
Other tax relief proposals contained in the House-passed plan would improve the fairness of the tax system for senior citizens and businesses, too. For instance, seniors will be more likely to accept Medicare reforms if they no longer have to pay today's surtax on their Social Security benefits; and businesses will be more likely to accept losses in corporate welfare programs if they know the tax code will not punish them for capital investments and risk-taking.
<p>
<b>Relieving the Pressure on Spending.</b> Members should also keep in mind that certain tax relief can change the behavior of some taxpaying groups in ways that ultimately reduce federal outlays for specific programs. Two examples in the House-passed plan are the tax credits for adoption and the improved tax treatment of long-term health care expenditures. Studies show that in many states, putting one child in foster care can cost taxpayers $10,000 to $30,000 per year. This cost could be reduced substantially to the extent that the adoption credit encourages more families to adopt foster children. Similarly, Medicaid's nursing home costs are exploding as many seniors are "divesting" themselves of their assets in order to become eligible for this taxpayer financed program. These public costs could be substantially reduced by the improved tax treatment of long-term care insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.
<p>
Members of Congress should understand how different elements of tax relief benefit their states. Many Members opposing tax relief choose to look only at the impact of reduced federal spending on their states or districts. They forget that if Washington does not spend the money, families will have more to buy necessities for their children, seniors will have more to pay for their own medical services, and businesses will have more to invest in their workers. While this private spending is not as politically visible as unveiling a new pork-barrel project, it does far more to improve the lives of citizens back home. 
<p>
The <a href="/heritage/">Heritage Foundation</a> has estimated the benefits of some of these tax relief proposals -- in some cases, as much as $10 billion to $20 billion over seven years -- for each state (see Appendix). Taxpayers do not need more government spending or new social programs to improve their well-being. Shifting the resources from Washington bureaucrats to families, seniors, and businesses should be viewed as a prudent way to reduce future government spending and encourage work saving and investment.
<p>
As Members negotiate over how to allocate the $245 billion in agreed-upon tax relief, they must remember the importance of putting families first. Working families have borne the largest burden for the rampant growth of government spending and stand to feel the greatest pinch as the rate of spending declines. Furthermore, family incomes have been declining since 1989 thanks to large tax increases imposed on them in 1990 and 1993.
<p>

<b>FAMILY TAX RELIEF</b>
<p>
	The House-passed balanced budget plan contains a substantial package of "family-friendly" tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts, and tax credits for families who adopt and those caring for elderly relatives. Over seven years, these family tax cut provisions total $184 billion, comprising 50 percent of the overall tax cut plan. Families, especially families with children, will benefit more than any other group of taxpayers from cutting more wasteful government spending. 
<p>

<b>#1) $500 per Child Tax Credit</b>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Republican Contract with America and the centerpiece of the House-passed plan is a $500 per child tax credit benefiting 35 million working families raising some 52 million children. Such tax relief for working families is long overdue. In 1948, the average American family with two children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal government in taxes. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. The family income lost in taxes over the past 45 years exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. Giving the typical family of four a $500 per child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
The House plan's $500 per child credit is "non-refundable," meaning the total value of the credit may not exceed a family's income tax bill. But it does provide uniform tax relief to all families with up to $200,000 per year in income, thereby reducing a low-income family's tax burden by a much greater proportion than an upper-income family's. 
<p>
Example:  A $500 per child tax credit would eliminate the entire federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year; cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year; and cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, the same credit would reduce the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per year by only 6.8 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $200,000 per year by just 2.6 percent.
<p>
Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that the typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. This means families in the typical district would receive $59 million per year in tax relief. The Appendix shows the amount of family tax relief by state. It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would more than outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting the federal spending needed to pay for it.
<p>

<b>#2) Tax Credit to Reduce the Marriage Penalty</b>
<p>
Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a joint return can end up paying more taxes than two single taxpayers filing individually. The House-passed bill takes a small step toward reducing this "marriage penalty" by giving these working couples a tax credit with a maximum value of $145 per year. The size of this credit would be determined by Treasury Department tax tables comparing the tax liability of a married couple filing jointly with their liability if they filed as unmarried workers. While the size of this tax credit is relatively small, it is a first step toward removing the tax code's bias against marriage and intact families.
<p>

<b>#3) New Individual Retirement Accounts</b>
<p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income (up to $2,000 per year) placed into these special accounts. However, this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to withdraw their money. 
<p>
The House-passed plan offers another way for taxpayers to avoid punishing taxes on retirement savings by creating a new IRA called the "American Dream Savings Account" ("ADS account"). Contributions to this account would be made from post-tax income, but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remain in the account for at least five years and the retiree has reached age  59<over>1/2</under>. This new form of IRA would give workers the incentive to save taxed income today in order to reap tax savings in retirement. That is why the ADS account is sometimes known as a "back-ended" IRA. 
<p>
Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be limited to $2,000 per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple), but this amount would be indexed to the rate of inflation in subsequent years. The plan also allows penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or to pay certain educational or medical expenses.
<p>
The House-passed plan also modifies current restrictions on the amount married spouses may contribute jointly to an IRA. Under current law, and subject to certain restrictions on workers with other retirement plans, individuals may place up to $2,000 into an IRA. However, spouses filing jointly are allowed to contribute only a combined $2,250 to their IRA, not $2,000 for each spouse. The new ADS account allows this same couple to contribute $2,000 for each spouse for a full $4,000, even if one spouse is not working. This provision would greatly assist the retirement plans of families in which one parent chose to stay home with the children. This change also would encourage lower-income taxpayers to save more for their retirement and rely less on Social Security.
<p>

<b>#4) Tax Credit for Adoption</b>
<p>
The estimated two million families ready to adopt children face huge expenses during the adoption process, but current tax law does not allow them to deduct adoption costs from their tax bill. The House-passed plan makes a substantial commitment to encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of $5,000 to offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to families earning up to $60,000 per year and gradually phased out for families earning up to $100,000 per year.
<p>
This credit could go a long way toward encouraging families who want to adopt less fortunate children but are prevented from doing so by the enormous cost. By encouraging more adoptions by solid middle-class families, this credit could lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of taxpayer-supported social service and foster care programs at both the federal and state levels. According to the American Public Welfare Association, close to 500,000 children were in the foster care system in 1992. Studies show that taxpayers pay an average of $10,000 per child per year for foster care programs and as much as $30,000 per child per year for more intensive shelter care programs.<sup>1</sup>  And while many couples want to adopt, they often are discouraged by the initial costs of the adoption process, especially if they have only a modest income. Thus, to the extent that the credit encourages additional parents to adopt, reductions in state and federal outlays to maintain these children in foster care or institutions would offset the revenue cost.

<p>
<b>#5) Tax Credit for Dependent Parents</b>
<p>
	The current tax code provides little relief to families who choose to care for an elderly parent or grandparent. The standard personal exemption of $2,500 is available for these families, but, as with the dependent child exemption, the value of the credit is greater for middle- and upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15 percent income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower their income tax by $375, the same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent bracket to lower their tax by $700.
<p>
The House plan offers additional -- and more equitable -- tax relief to families who care for their parents and grandparents in the form of a uniform $500 tax credit. Such a credit could help many families who prefer to care for their elderly relatives at home but cannot afford the expense. To avoid burdening their children and grandchildren with this expense, many seniors are divesting themselves of their wealth in order to become eligible for the long-term program funded by Medicaid. This program, which pays for nursing home care for seniors, is quickly becoming the fastest growing program in the federal budget. The $500 tax credit could help reduce this cost by encouraging more families to take an active role in caring for their elderly relatives.
<p>

<b>TAX RELIEF FOR SENIORS</b>
<p>
The House budget proposal contains provisions that are especially important to many retired or terminally ill Americans with particular financial needs. It repeals the "elderly surtax" provisions of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase, which imposed a high tax rate on income from savings, investments, and pensions.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, it provides tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care insurance, allows terminally and chronically ill people to receive insurance benefits before their death without an income tax penalty, and increases the amount individuals between age 65 and 69 may continue to earn from employment without losing their Social Security benefits.

<p>
<b>#6) Repeal of the Tax Increase on Social Security Benefits</b>
<p>
	Over four million retired Americans were shocked to discover a severe penalty in their 1994 federal taxes, imposed by the 1993 tax bill on their income from savings for retirement. The penalty imposed by Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a higher marginal tax rate for all Americans over age 65 who supplemented their Social Security pensions with personal savings and pensions earned during their working years. Withdrawals from IRA savings accounts are particularly hard hit, and these withdrawals are mandatory after age 701/2. Retired people above that age cannot avoid turning over significant portions of their retirement savings to the tax collectors.
<p>
The House plan gradually repeals the 1993 increase in this tax on savings over a five-year period but does not eliminate it entirely. It cuts the maximum tax to 75 percent in 1996, 65 percent in 1997, 60 percent in 1998, 55 percent in 1999, and 50 percent in 2000 and later years. The complete elimination of this highly complex section of the tax code should be a top priority in Congress, since it is a direct attack on responsible individuals' ability to prepare for retirement by saving. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has identified this tax as a priority for repeal:  "punishing people who work and save all their life...is not only morally wrong, it is bad social policy."<sup>3</sup><p>All Social Security recipients must fill out a complicated worksheet just to calculate whether they are subject to the higher tax rate, which adds to the complexity of the tax code for these senior citizens. The tax computation also obscures the higher rates, since the method of figuring whether it is due has been made extremely confusing and depends on how much income anyone receives from savings. For most Social Security recipients, the additional complicated paperwork this April 15 was simply bothersome, because their calculations placed them below an exempt threshold. But the higher rates hit hard those taxpayers with retirement income greater than $25,000 ($32,000 for married taxpayers) from private pensions, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) savings plan, and dividends or interest from investments. Although incomes below the exemption are not subject to the higher rates, the tax threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation, so in a few years most if not all retired Americans with income from savings will be penalized.
<p>
The elderly surtax has two brackets. The first increases the taxpayer's marginal rate by 50 percent (for example, from 15 to 22.5 percent); the second, by 85 percent (from 28 to 51.8 percent). The second bracket applies to individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married taxpayers above $44,000. As the table on the following page illustrates, for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, the elderly surtax imposes an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent on any funds they withdraw from IRA savings. These high rates begin to wipe out mandatory IRA withdrawals at age 701/2.
<p>
The low savings rate for retirement among middle-income Americans in the prime of life is one of the most serious policy concerns in Congress today. Yet the surtax on savings for Social Security recipients, of which many seniors often are unaware until they start withdrawing their IRA savings, makes a mockery of the incentives to save. It is a cruel joke because the tax rates are higher, not lower as most savers were promised. Repealing this vicious surtax on the savings of elderly Americans is not just good social policy. It is the right thing to do.
<p>

<b>#7) Modify the Social Security Earnings Test	</b>
<p>
	Approximately two million Americans over age 65 supplement their Social Security benefits with income earned through part-time jobs. For many elderly people, retirement is out of the question because it would mean economic hardship. They simply have inadequate savings or no private pension benefits. The Social Security law has cut benefits severely for retirees who continue to work and earn more than $11,280. This limitation applies to those between the ages of 65 and 70 and is indexed annually for inflation. Those who earn more lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 of wages earned. The House of Representatives budget proposal would raise the annual earnings limit to $30,000. The increases would be phased in over five years:  from $15,000 in 1996 to $19,000 in 1997; $23,000 in 1998; $27,000 in 1999; and $30,000 in the year 2000. The earnings limit thereafter would be indexed for inflation.
<p>
The earnings limit requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to recalculate pension benefits and attempt to collect amounts paid to retired people who earned more than the law permits. Retirees must forecast their year's earnings in advance and have their Social Security cut, but if their estimated income is too low, they must fill out application forms to recover their lost benefits. The SSA estimates that 60 percent of all overpayments and 45 percent of all underpayments occur because of the earnings limit. This limit costs over $200 million per year in administrative paperwork, most of which would be saved by expanding the earnings limit as proposed in the House budget resolution.
<p>
In the next few decades, the generation approaching retirement generally will have inadequate savings to enjoy leisure without supplemental earnings. In addition, the lower birthrate in the past two decades will have tightened the labor market, so many elderly workers may find their experience and skills still very much in demand. The U.S. economy will enjoy higher economic growth and semi-retired workers will have a more adequate standard of living with the proposed modification in the Social Security earnings test.
<P>

<b>#8) Provide an Incentive for Private Long-Term Care</b>
<p>
	As the health of elderly Americans improves and more people live to very old age, the financial burden of providing care for this increasingly dependent group has become a challenge for public policy. Increasingly, middle-class Americans discover later in life that despite the prudent decisions they have made to cover their income and health care needs during retirement, they face unanticipated and staggering costs for nursing home care. Many see the savings and other assets assembled during their working lives disappear rapidly when they become chronically sick or frail and need institutional care. One response to this threat has been for elderly Americans to transfer assets to their children so that they can qualify for nursing home assistance under the Medicaid program. States and the federal government are concerned about the rising cost of the long-term portion of Medicaid, partly because of this "gaming" of Medicaid. 
<p>
In an attempt to control future budget outlays for health and welfare benefits, people should be given effective incentives to provide for their own long-term care. The House budget resolution provides several new tax provisions to encourage individuals and employers to provide long-term care insurance. Starting in 1996, long-term care insurance generally would be treated the same as accident and health insurance, and employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical benefits. Individuals would be allowed to exchange existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts for long-term care policies without incurring any income tax liability. They also would be permitted to withdraw funds from IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement plans to purchase long-term care insurance.
<p>
Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes when they exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care expenses today generally are not tax-deductible. Under the House budget resolution, eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for qualified long-term care services would be treated the same as other medical expenses, and benefits received under a long-term care insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $200 per day).
<p>
Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health care and financing them under tax provisions similar to those for medical insurance makes good sense, especially in view of the growing elderly population. Delaying the incentives to prepare for an easily foreseen future problem would be shortsighted, making more likely even heavier state and federal spending on nursing home care.
<p>

<b>#9) Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the Terminally Ill</b>
<p>
	Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but insured individuals and their families have no way to obtain benefits prior to death without a severe income tax liability -- even though many insurance companies are willing to offer such "accelerated benefits."  In the case of lingering illness with no prospect of recovery, an elderly person could exhaust all his savings and apply for Medicaid, unable to claim potentially huge life insurance benefits. And if the elderly person no longer has the means to make premium payments, his policies may be allowed to lapse.
<p>
The House budget includes a provision to facilitate the practice by which some insurance providers pay benefits prior to death if the insured person is terminally or chronically ill. Such payments would be excluded from a taxpayer's gross income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition, similar tax-exempt treatment is allowed for amounts received from the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract to a qualified settlement provider. In these cases, the insured would receive a payment comparable to the value of insurance benefits, and the settlement provider eventually would collect the insurance. As in the case of long-term care benefits, the tax-exempt amount for someone who is chronically but not terminally ill would be subject to the $200 per day exclusion limit.
<p>
The tragedy of terminal illness and the financial burden of chronic illness ought to be sufficient misery for anyone, but the federal tax code adds a degree of bureaucratic hostility. Life insurance is offered with benefits payable under these circumstances, and older policies can be sold or converted to obtain benefits before death. The income tax code should be made more consistent with this humane and increasingly common practice.

<p>
<b>TAX RELIEF TO PROMOTE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
	In addition to family tax relief provisions, the House-passed budget resolution includes a number of reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on savings and investment. Included in this category are:
<p>
<b>#10) Reduction in Capital Gains Tax</b>
<p>
	The U.S. tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once:  twice through the corporate and individual income taxes and again by taxing capital gains. The current maximum tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent, and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, exempt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax them at a greatly reduced rate while often indexing the basis of the gains to inflation.
<p>
The House bill lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the maximum capital gains rate to slightly below 20 percent. Second, it permits individuals to index the value of assets to ensure that they are not being taxed on purely inflationary gains. This rewards new investment and risk-taking. As the Appendix illustrates, this provision will reduce the tax burden on investment by an estimated $63.2 billion between 1995 and 2002.<sup>4</sup>  It is a positive, albeit limited, step toward the goal of eliminating capital gains taxes.<p><b>#11) Neutral Cost Recovery </b><p>Under current law, businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years. This is different from all other business expenses that can be deducted in the year of purchase, or "fully expensed."  However, the value of a long-term write-off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value.
<p>
The House plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the depreciation schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money. The House bill adjusts depreciation schedules (which determine how fast businesses can deduct the cost of new investments) to protect investors from inflation and otherwise remove biases against investment, particularly for long-term projects. The provision is designed to approximate the ideal tax policy of immediate expensing of capital investment (as found in the flat tax). By correcting this flaw in the tax code, Congress would help encourage businesses to invest more heavily in America's future economic growth.

<p>
<b>#12) Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
<p>
	 The House bill repeals the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and modifies the individual AMT. These provisions impose some of the heaviest compliance costs and raise limited revenues. Combined with the Neutral Cost Recovery provision, AMT relief would ease the tax burden on American business by about $42 billion over seven years (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>

<b>#13) Expensing for Small Business</b>
<p>
In addition to neutral cost recovery, the House bill increases the amount of investment which can be immediately expensed. Along with other modest reforms, small business will realize $11.4 billion of tax relief (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>
The House tax provisions are a positive first step on the road to pro-growth tax reform. Adoption would boost incentives to save and invest, thereby ensuring faster growth for the economy and higher incomes for American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The dilemma facing the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee is how to allocate among families, businesses, and seniors the $245 billion in tax relief provided in the fiscal 1996 budget resolution. The priorities established in the $354 billion House-passed tax relief package are the place to start. 	 Family tax relief, capital gains cuts, and expanded IRAs should be the centerpiece of the new package, as they were for the House-passed plan, because of their widespread benefits to taxpayers and the economy. In particular, the $500 per child tax credit will benefit some 35 million working families, more taxpayers than any other measure. Further, the halving of the capital gains tax and the expansion of IRAs will generate more investment and savings than any of the more targeted measures in the House plan. And as Members add other elements to the new plan, they should also keep in mind the impact that certain tax relief proposals may have on federal outlays. Tax relief that returns money to Americans, and gives them an incentive to make provision for such things as nursing home care for their parents or themselves, also can reduce the cost of federal and state programs.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A year ago, a 16-year-old constituent of mine, Jeff Gardner, died from a lethal combination of "huffing" gasoline and smoking marijuana. After Jeff's death, his mother, who was aware of a much larger drug problem in the community, called a parent's meeting at the local high school. No one came. She told me her story and asked how her representative in Congress was going to help address the growing drug problem. It was a fair question, but I was not satisfied with the response I could give her. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress take seriously their responsibility to represent their constituents in Washington -- by legislating, by voting, and when appropriate, by securing federal funding for state and local concerns. Despite spending $13 billion annually on drug-control programs, however, drug abuse is rising dramatically among our youth.
<p>
<table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>We'll continue to lose the war on drugs until national politicians show local leadership</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A big part of the problem has been the president's failure to show any leadership on this issue (until his wise appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar). In fact, President Clinton hurt the antidrug effort by cutting the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 full-time positions, by hiring a surgeon general who advocated legalization of drugs, by cutting funding for interdiction efforts, and by sending confusing messages about the stigma of illegal drug use. It is no surprise, then, that after dramatic reductions in drug use during the decade before Clinton took office, drug use has nearly doubled among teenagers during his administration. The evidence shows that <i>national leadership</i> is critical in reducing drug abuse.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeff's mother wanted that leadership, but in a manner that would help her in Goshen, Ohio. Spending more federal dollars on drug-control programs was unlikely to directly touch this mother's life. Neither would it encourage other parents in her community to address the drug problem. How could I really help? By rolling up my sleeves and providing leadership where it matters most--at the local community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress are in a unique position to mobilize people in their own communities. By the nature of our jobs, we deal with every sector of the districts we represent. We can also bring statewide and nationwide expertise and resources to bear on a problem. And we can draw the attention of news media that is so critical to educating and mobilizing neighborhoods to solve their toughest social problems. What I've initiated -- and what I'm challenging my colleagues in Congress to embrace -- is a new model of governance that recognizes the limitations of Washington-based solutions, while drawing on the resources of citizens locally.
<p>
<b>Cause for Alarm</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If there is any public-policy area that demands a new, more effective approach, it is drug abuse. Recent Gallup polls show that crime and drugs are Americans' top concerns. When you ask parents and children what is the most serious issue facing youth today, both groups cite drug abuse.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
National statistics show there is indeed cause for alarm. After a decade of progress in the war on drugs, the number of young people using drugs began to increase in 1992; use among young kids showed the sharpest increase. LSD use is now at its highest level since 1975, when it was first measured. Since 1992, the number of children between 12 and 17 using marijuana has nearly doubled. To put the problem in perspective, in the average class of 25 eighth-graders (13- and 14-year-olds), five are now using marijuana. And drug abuse is implicated in other social problems -- violent crime, dropout rates, and domestic violence, to name a few. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Greater Cincinnati has a drug problem that mirrors the startling national statistics. This region of the country experienced a similar decline in drug use in the 1980s. But by the early 1990s, it began to skyrocket. Why?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I'm convinced that the resurgence stems in part from the disappearance both of effective national leadership in the fight against drug use and of the media attention that usually follows such leadership. This attention is vital to teaching children that drug abuse is both dangerous and wrong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No one makes this point more authoritatively than Jim Burke, the chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. It was Burke's group in the 1980s that launched the most extensive and successful public-service campaign in the country. Burke also believes strongly that, while the message must emanate from our national leaders and engage the opinion shapers at every level, this issue is best addressed at the community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to action. Over the last year and a half, I have spearheaded an effort to establish the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. This effort is not about flashy press conferences and slick brochures. It's a serious, long-term initiative that brings together for the first time community activists already involved in the antidrug effort, key business figures, religious leaders, the media, parents, young people, law enforcement officials, and others. Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.
<p>
<b>Mobilizing Citizens</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How do you start a coalition? First, you do a lot of listening at all levels -- to kids and parents, grass-roots activists, and state and national leaders in the field. Over an 18-month period, we led or helped organize countless meetings in all sorts of settings, from living rooms to classrooms, and from boardrooms to community centers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We made it clear through the amount of time we devoted to the effort--more than 1,000 man-hours over 18 months -- and through our inclusive, nonpartisan approach that this was not about re-election campaigns or shallow publicity. The reaction from the community to this new kind of leadership has so far been very positive. Every television station, every major radio station, the two daily newspapers, and our largest outdoor advertising company are all running antidrug public service announcements and ads. Some of the radio spots are from a popular local rock band. We know that such messages help reduce drug abuse, and Greater Cincinnati now has one of the most aggressive antidrug media campaigns in the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such messages, however, are not enough. The data shows that most people who use drugs go to work every day. Also, work is a good place to find parents who need counsel on dealing with teenage drug use. So we had to engage businesses. We took an idea proposed by one of our national prevention experts and brought it to our coalition in Greater Cincinnati. The result? One of our largest health-care providers and the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation will offer, for the first time ever, financial discounts to businesses that adopt certified drug-free workplace programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The program makes sense. Businesses like it because health-care and workers' compensation coverage costs less. Health-care providers and the bureau like it because drug-free workplace programs do result in a healthier work force and fewer medical and workers' compensation claims. Communities like it because it helps keep workers drug free, encourages drug abusers to seek treatment, and educates people about the dangers of drug abuse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We also brought PRIDE, a premier national parents' group, to one of our school districts to train more than 600 parents in taking practical steps to keep their kids drug free. This training will be replicated in every school district in the region. Parents are signing up in droves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We mobilized our local clergy to incorporate an antidrug message in their sermons every six months and to follow up with an educational slide presentation that we developed. We have established a speakers' bureau to supplement the D.A.R.E. program in the schools, and to help get the message out in community centers and student clubs. The list of initiatives proposed by the local community, brought to the coalition by state and national leaders, and facilitated by congressional leadership, goes on and on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition, I have brought to Greater Cincinnati national and state prevention experts to bolster the local effort, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education. I have also brought the president's drug czar, Senator Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich to Cincinnati to see the coalition's work firsthand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The public rightly expects the federal government to do something about drug abuse, which diminishes and threatens the lives of so many of our young people. And the federal government clearly has an important role in combating drug abuse: protecting our borders and interdicting drugs from other countries, strengthening our federal criminal-justice system, and providing federal assistance for the best prevention and treatment programs.	
	Despite a significant federal effort, however, our country is still seeing dramatic increases in drug use among our teenagers. In the last t<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
wo years alone, use of illegal drugs has increased 50 percent. We need a new approach.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of my colleagues are beginning to agree. At least 15 other members of Congress are establishing, or supporting, similar community coalition efforts in their regions. The entire House of Representatives -- in an unusual show of election-year bipartisanship -- recently endorsed this community-based initiative.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's a much more significant step than cynics imagine. Although the public has become disenchanted with the federal government's ability to address our worst social problems, there's still an abiding faith in a community's ability to fashion solutions close to the needs of ordinary people. And members of Congress can still be a catalyst. Although the public seems to distrust Congress as a whole, individual members are generally well respected in their districts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is that members of Congress <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> inspire citizens to action. We've heard about the need to revitalize civil society. Well, here's a concrete example of how members of Congress can do that in a way that actually touches people's lives -- not by passing more laws in Washington, but by using their bully pulpits to engage their communities back home. This is how we as national leaders can best exert--and sustain -- national leadership over the long haul. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And for the sake of the Jeff Gardners in our communities, we'd better get started.

<h3>THE REAL ROOT CAUSES OF VIOLENT CRIME:<br>
The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No.  1026<br>
March 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     Policymakers at last are coming to recognize the connection between
the breakdown of American families and various social problems.  The
unfolding debate over welfare reform, for instance, has been shaped by the
wide acceptance in recent years that children born into single-parent families
are much more likely than children of intact families to fall into poverty and
welfare dependence themselves in later years.  These children, in fact, face
a daunting array of problems.
<P>
     While this link between illegitimacy and chronic welfare dependency
now is better understood, policymakers also need to appreciate another
strong and disturbing pattern evident in scholarly studies:  the link between 
illegitimacy and violent crime and between the lack of parental attachment
and violent crime.  Without an understanding of the root causes of criminal
behavior -- how criminals are formed -- Members of Congress and state
legislators cannot understand why whole sectors of society, particularly in
urban areas, are being torn apart by crime.  And without that knowledge,
sound policymaking is impossible.
<P>
          A review of the empirical evidence in the professional
literature of the social sciences gives policymakers an insight into the root
causes of crime.  Consider, for instance:
<P>
Over the past thirty years, the rise in violent crime parallels the rise in
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
High-crime neighborhoods are characterized by high concentrations of
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
State-by-state analysis by Heritage scholars indicates that a 10 percent
increase in the percentage of children living in single-parent homes leads
typically to a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
The rate of violent teenage crime corresponds with the number of families
abandoned by fathers.
<P>
The type of aggression and hostility demonstrated by a future criminal often
is foreshadowed in unusual aggressiveness as early as age five or six.
<P>
The future criminal tends to be an individual rejected by other children as
early as the first grade who goes on to form his own group of friends, often
the future delinquent gang.
<P>
On the other hand: 
<P>
Neighborhoods with a high degree of religious practice are not high-crime
neighborhoods.
<P>
Even in high-crime inner-city neighborhoods, well over 90 percent of
children from safe, stable homes do not become delinquents.  By contrast
only 10 percent of children from unsafe, unstable homes in these
neighborhoods avoid crime.
<P>
Criminals capable of sustaining marriage gradually move away from a life
of crime after they get married.
<P>
The mother's strong affectionate attachment to her child is the child's best
buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
The father's authority and involvement in raising his children are also a
great buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
     The scholarly evidence, in short, suggests that at the heart of the
explosion of crime in America is the loss of the capacity of fathers and
mothers to be responsible in caring for the children they bring into the
world.  This loss of love and guidance at the intimate levels of marriage and
family has broad social consequences for children and for the wider
community.  The empirical evidence shows that too many young men and
women from broken families tend to have a much weaker sense of
connection with their neighborhood and are prone to exploit its members to
satisfy their unmet needs or desires.  This contributes to a loss of a sense
of community and to the disintegration of neighborhoods into social chaos
and violent crime.  If policymakers are to deal with the root causes of
crime, therefore, they must deal with the rapid rise of illegitimacy.
     
     <P>     

<B> OFFICIAL WASHINGTON'S VIEW OF CRIME </B><P>
     The professional literature in criminology is quite at odds with
orthodox thinking in official Washington.  Many lawmakers in Congress and
in the states assume that the high level of crime in America must have its
roots in material conditions, such as poor employment opportunities and a
shortage of adequately funded social programs.  But Members of Congress
and other policymakers cannot understand the root causes of crime if they
insist on viewing it purely in material terms.  This view blinds policymakers
to the personal aspects of crime, including moral failure, the refusal to
exercise personal responsibility, and the inability or refusal to enter into
family and community relationships based on love, respect, and attachment
both to the broader community and to a common code of conduct.
<P>
          The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, supported by the Clinton Administration and enacted last year,
perfectly embodies official Washington's thinking about crime.  It provides
for billions of dollars in new spending, adding 15 new social programs on
top of a welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5 trillion since the "War on
Poverty" was declared in 1965.  There is no reason to suppose the
programs will have any significant effect.  Since 1965, welfare spending has
increased 800 percent in real terms, while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the rate before 1960.  As Senator Phil
Gramm (R-TX) says, "If social spending stopped crime we would be the
safest country in the world."
<P>
          Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), former chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and a major sponsor of the recent crime bill, summed
up the predominant view of crime prevention:  "These [social services] are
all good programs.  They are all designed to do the same thing -- give these
kids something to say yes to."  Likewise, the Department of Justice's report,
"Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile
Offenders," accurately diagnoses the roots of the problem (in terms of
family, religion, and moral formation), but then recommends a long list of
new federal social programs on top of the current programs.
      <P>
           But the conventional assumptions about the root causes of
crime -- and thus the solutions -- are wide of the mark:
<P>
<B> Poverty and Unemployment </B>
<P>
     The central proposition in official Washington's thinking about crime
is that poverty is the primary cause of crime.  In its simplest form, this
contention is absurd; if it were true, there would have been more crime in
the past, when more people were poorer.  And in poorer nations, the crime
rates would be higher than in the United States.  More significantly, history
defies the assumption that deteriorating economic circumstances breed crime
(and improving conditions reduce it).  Instead, America's crime rate
gradually rose during the long period of real economic growth:  1905 to
1933.  As the Great Depression set in and incomes dropped, the crime rate
also dropped.  It rose again between 1965 and 1974 when incomes rose
steadily.  Most recently, during the recession of 1982, there was a slight dip
in crime, not an increase.
<P>
          What is true of the general population is also true of black
Americans.  For example, between 1950 and 1974 black income in
Philadelphia almost doubled, and homicides more than doubled.  Even the
Reverend Jesse Jackson, whose prescriptions for social reform mirror
conventional liberal ideology, admits that black-on-black homicide is not an
issue of poverty.  The crime rate in other communities also shows no link
between low incomes and crime.  The Chinese in San Francisco in the mid-
1960s, for instance, had the lowest family income of any ethnic group (less
than $4,000 per year) but next to no crime:  only 5 Chinese in all of
California were then in prison.
<P>
<B> Race and Crime </B>
<P>
     There is a widespread belief that race is a major explanatory cause
of crime.  This belief is anchored in the large disparity in crime rates
between whites and blacks.  However, a closer look at the data shows that
the real variable is not race but family structure and all that it implies in
commitment and love between adults.  The incidence of broken families is
much higher in the black community.  Douglas Smith and G.  Roger
Jarjoura, in a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals, found that "the
percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12
and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary." 
The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that
there is an association between race and crime is false.  Illegitimacy is the
key factor.  It is the absence of marriage, and the failure to form and
maintain intact families, that explains the incidence of high crime in a
neighborhood among whites as well as blacks.  This contradicts
conventional wisdom.
     <P>
          Bolstering the Smith-Jarjoura study, University of Illinois
sociologist Robert J.  Sampson, in a study on the differential effects of
poverty and family disruption on crime, states:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Overall the analysis shows that rates of black violent
     offending, especially by juveniles, are strongly influenced by
     variations in family structure.  Independent of the major
     candidates supplied by prior criminological theory (e.g. 
     income, region, size, density, age and race composition)
     black family disruption has the largest effects on black
     juvenile robbery and homicide.... The effects of family
     structure are strong and cannot be easily dismissed by
     reference to other structural and cultural features of urban
     environments.... The effect of family disruption on black
     violence is not due to the effect of black violence on family
     structure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Sampson adds:  "the predictors of white robbery are in large part
identical in sign and magnitude to those for blacks."
<P>
<B> HOW CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR DEVELOPS </B>
<P>
     Propensity to crime develops in stages associated with major
psychological and sociological factors.  The factors are not caused by race
or poverty, and the stages are the normal tasks of growing up that every
child confronts as he gets older.  In the case of future violent criminals these
tasks, in the absence of the love, affection, and dedication of both his
parents, become perverse exercises, frustrating his needs and stunting his
ability to belong.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The stages are: </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Early infancy and the development of the capacity for empathy.
Early family life and the development of relationships based on agreements
being kept and a sense of an intimate place where he belongs.
Early school life and the development of peer relationships based on
cooperation and agreements conveying a sense of a community to which he
belongs.
<P>
Mid-childhood and the experience of a growing capacity to learn and
cooperate within his community.
<P>
Adolescence and the need to belong as an adult and to perform. 
<P>
 Generativity, or the begetting of the next generation through intimate sexual
union and bringing others into the family and the community.
<P>
     In all of these stages the lack of dedication and the atmosphere of
rejection or conflict within the family diminish the child's experience of his
personal life as one of love, dedication, and a place to belong.  Instead, it
is characterized increasingly by rejection, abandonment, conflict, isolation,
and even abuse.  He is compelled to seek a place to belong outside of such
a home and, most frequently not finding it in the ordinary community, finds
it among others who have experienced similar rejection.  He becomes
attached to those who are alienated, for, like him, they have been rejected. 
Not finding acceptance and nurturance from caring adults, they begin
conveying their own form of acceptance.
<P>
<B> STAGE ONE:  THE BROKEN FAMILY </B>
<P>
     The evidence of the professional literature is overwhelming:  teenage
criminal behavior has its roots in habitual deprivation of parental love and
affection going back to early infancy.  Future delinquents invariably have
a chaotic, disintegrating family life.  This frequently leads to aggression and
hostility toward others outside the family.  Most delinquents are not
withdrawn or depressed.  Quite the opposite:  they are actively involved in
their neighborhood, but often in a violent fashion.  This hostility is
established in the first few years of life.  By age six, habits of aggression
and free-floating anger typically are already formed.  By way of contrast,
normal children enjoy a sense of personal security derived from their natural
attachment to their mother.  The future criminal is often denied that natural
attachment.
<P>
          The relationship between parents, not just the relationship
between mother and child, has a powerful effect on very young children. 
Children react to quarreling parents by disobeying, crying, hitting other
children, and in general being much more antisocial than their peers. 
And, significantly, quarreling or abusive parents do not generally vent their
anger equally on all their children.  Such parents tend to vent their anger on
their more difficult children.  This parental hostility and physical and
emotional abuse of the child shapes the future delinquent.
<P>
          Most delinquents are children who have been abandoned by
their fathers.  They are often deprived also of the love and affection they
need from their mother.  Inconsistent parenting, family turmoil, and
multiple other stresses (such as economic hardship and psychiatric
illnesses) that flow from these disagreements compound the rejection of
these children by these parents, many of whom became criminals during
childhood.  With all these factors working against the child's normal
development, by age five the future criminal already will tend to be
aggressive, hostile, and hyperactive.  Four-fifths of children destined to be
criminals will be "antisocial" by 11 years of age, and fully two-thirds of
antisocial five-year-olds will be delinquent by age 15. 
<P>
           Summing up the findings of the professional literature on
juvenile delinquency, Kevin Wright, professor of criminal justice at the State
University of New York at Binghamton, writes:  "Research confirms that
children raised in supportive, affectionate, and accepting homes are less
likely to become deviant.  Children rejected by parents are among the most
likely to become delinquent."
     <P>
     
     
     

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #1:  Fatherless Families </B>
<P>
     According to the professional literature, the absence of the father is
the single most important cause of poverty.  The same is true for crime. 
According to Kevin and Karen Wright, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Research into the idea that single-parent homes may produce
     more delinquents dates back to the early 19th century....
     [O]fficials at New York State's Auburn Penitentiary, in an
     attempt to discern the causes of crime, studied the
     biographies of incarcerated men.  Reports to the legislature
     in 1829 and 1830 suggested that family disintegration
     resulting from the death, desertion, or divorce of parents led
     to undisciplined children who eventually became criminals. 
     Now well over a century later, researchers continue to
     examine the family background of unique populations and
     reach similar conclusions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     The growth of the poverty-ridden family today is linked directly with
the growth of the family headed by the always-single mother.  And this
modern form of family disintegration -- or more accurately non-formation
-- has its consequences for criminal behavior.  The growth in crime is
paralleled by the growth in families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
     As the chart on the following page shows, the rate of juvenile crime
within each state is closely linked to the percentage of children raised in
single-parent families.  States with a lower percentage of single-parent
families, on average, will have lower rates of juvenile crime.  State-by-state
analysis indicates that, in general, a 10 percent increase in the number of
children living in single-parent homes (including divorces) accompanies a
17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
     Along with the increased probability of family poverty and
heightened risk of delinquency, a father's absence is associated with a host
of other social problems.  The three most prominent effects are lower
intellectual development, higher levels of illegitimate parenting in the
teenage years, and higher levels of welfare dependency.  According to a
1990 report from the Department of Justice, more often than not, missing
and "throwaway" children come from single-parent families, families with
step parents, and cohabiting-adult families.
<P>
     Abandoned mothers.  In normal families a father gives support to his
wife, particularly during the period surrounding birth and in the early
childhood years when children make heavy demands on her.  In popular
parlance, he is her "burn-out" prevention.  But a single mother does not
have this support, and the added emotional and physical stress may result
in fatigue and less parent availability to the child, increasing the risk of a
relationship with the child that is emotionally more distant.  The single
mother generally is less able to attend to all of her child's needs as quickly
or as fully as she could if she were well taken care of by a husband.  These
factors tend to affect the mother's emotional attachment to her child and in
turn reduce the child's lifelong capacity for emotional attachment to others
and empathy for others.  Such empathy helps restrain a person from acting
against others' well-being.  Violent criminals obviously lack this.  At the
extreme, and a more common situation in America's inner cities, the distant
relationship between a mother and child can become an abusing and
neglectful relationship.  Under such conditions the child is at risk of
becoming a psychopath. 
<P>
      These observations have disturbing implications for society.  If the
conditions in which psychopathy is bred continue to increase, then America
will have proportionately more psychopaths, and society is at an increased
risk of suffering in unpredictable ways.
<P>
     Abandoned sons.  A father's attention to his son has enormous
positive effects on a boy's emotional and social development.  But a boy
abandoned by his father is deprived of a deep sense of personal security. 
According to Rolf Loeber, Professor of Psychiatry, Psychology and
Epidemiology at the Western Psychiatric Institute in the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, "A close and intense relationship between
a boy and his father prevents hostility and inappropriate aggressiveness." 
This inappropriate aggressiveness is an early indication of potential
delinquency later on, particularly in boys.  Furthermore, such bad
behavior is a barrier to the child's finding a place among his more normal
peers, and aggressiveness usually is the precursor of a hostile and violent
"street" attitude.  Elijah Anderson, Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania, observes that these young men, very sensitive in their
demands for "respect," display a demeanor which communicates "deterrent
aggression" not unlike the behavior that causes normal peers to reject and
isolate aggressive boys in grade school.  The message of this body
language, of course, triggers rejection by the normal adult community.
<P>
     Absence of a Father's Authority and Discipline.  The dominant role
of fathers in preventing delinquency is well-established.  Over forty years
ago, this phenomenon was highlighted in the classic studies of the causes of
delinquency by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck of Harvard University. 
They described in academic terms what many children hear their mothers
so often say:  "Wait till your father gets home!"  In a well-functioning
family, the very presence of the father embodies authority, an authority
conveyed through his daily involvement in family life.  This paternal
authority is critical to the prevention of psychopathology and
delinquency. 
<P>
      The benefits a child receives from his relationship with his father
are notably different from those derived from his relationship with his
mother.  The father contributes a sense of paternal authority and discipline
which is conveyed through his involved presence.  The additional benefits
of his affection and attachment add to this primary benefit.  Albert Bandura,
professor of psychology at Stanford University, observed as early as 1959
that delinquents suffer from an absence of the father's affection.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #2:  The Absence of a Mother's
Love
</B><P>
     According to Professor Rolf Loeber of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine:  "There is increasing evidence for an important critical
period that occurs early in children's lives.  At that time, youngsters'
attachment to adult caretakers is formed.  This helps them to learn prosocial
skills and to unlearn any aggressive or acting out behaviors."
<P>
     The early experience of intense maternal affection is the basis for the
development of a conscience and moral empathy with others.
<P>
     If a child's emotional attachment to his mother is disrupted during
the first few years, permanent harm can be done to his capacity for
emotional attachment to others.  He will be less able to trust others and
throughout his life will stay more distant emotionally from others.  Having
many different caretakers during the first few years can lead to a loss of this
sense of attachment for life and to antisocial behavior.  Separation from
the mother, especially between six months and three years of age, can lead
to long lasting negative effects on behavior and emotional development. 
Severe maternal deprivation is a critical ingredient of juvenile delinquency: 
As John Bowlby, the father of attachment research, puts it, "Theft, like
rheumatic fever, is a disease of childhood, and, as in rheumatic fever,
attacks in later life are frequently in the nature of recurrences."  A child's
emotional attachment to his mother is powerful in other ways.  For example,
even after a period of juvenile delinquency, a young man's ability to
become emotionally attached to his wife can make it possible for him to
turn away from crime.  This capacity is rooted in the very early
attachment to his mother.  We also know that a weak marital attachment
resulting in separation or divorce accompanies a continuing life of crime.
<P>
     Many family conditions can weaken a mother's attachment to her
young child.  Perhaps the mother herself is an emotionally unattached
person.  The mother could be so lacking in family and emotional support
that she cannot fill the emotional needs of the child.  She could return to
work, or be forced to return to work, too soon after the birth of her child. 
Or, while she is at work, there could be a change in the personnel
responsible for the child's day care.  The more prevalent these conditions,
the less likely a child will be securely attached to his mother and the more
likely he will be hostile and aggressive.
<P>
     The mother's relationship with her children during this early period
is also relevant to the debate over child care.  According to Professor James
Q.  Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles, the extended
absence of a working mother from her child during the early critical stages
of the child's emotional development increases the risk of delinquency. 
Specifically, say Stephen Cernkovich and Peggy Giordano, "maternal
employment affects behavior indirectly, through such factors as lack of
supervision, loss of direct control, and attenuation of close relationships." 
Thus, forcing a young single mother to return to work too soon after the
birth of her baby is bad public policy.  Unfortunately, the Clinton
Administration's welfare reform bill would do just that.
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #3:  Parental Fighting and
Domestic Violence </B>
<P>
     The empirical evidence shows that, for a growing child, the happiest
and most tranquil family situation is the intact primary marriage.  But
even within intact two-parent families, serious parental conflict has bad
effects.  The famous studies of Harvard professors Sheldon and Eleanor
Glueck in the 1950s found that one-third of delinquent boys in their sample
came from homes with spouse abuse.  The Cambridge-Somerville Youth
Study observed that the incidence of delinquent behavior was higher in
intact homes characterized by a high degree of conflict and neglect than it
was in broken homes without conflict.  Dr.  Travis Hirschi, professor of
criminology at Arizona State University, in a study of junior and senior high
school children in Northern California, replicated these findings a decade
later.  As these and other studies have shown, the lack of emotional
attachment to parents is more strongly related to delinquency than is an
intact home.  Professor Kevin N.  Wright, in his review of the literature
for the Department of Justice, lists 21 other major studies that clearly show
the link between parental conflict and delinquency.  The lesson is clear: 
conflict between parents hurts the child.  The more frequent or intense the
conflict, the more the child is hurt emotionally.  In sharp contrast,
tranquillity and peace in the family and in the marriage help prevent
delinquency.
<P>
     Family Breakup.  Breakup of his parents' marriage during the first
five years of his life places a child at high risk of becoming a juvenile
delinquent.  This breakup -- through either divorce or separation -- is
most likely to occur three to four years after marriage.  Therefore, a large
proportion of very young children experience the emotional pain of the early
and final stages of marital dissolution at a time when they are most
vulnerable to disruptions in their emotional attachment to their parents. 
<P>
      Conflict within "step families" (families where at least one of the
married parents is not the biological parent of all the children) also has
serious effects.  According to the California Youth Authority study of
female delinquents, conducted by Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of
criminology at California State University, "In the two parent families
examined in this study a great deal of conflict was present.  Of these
parents, 71 percent fought regularly about the children.  Since there were
often 'his', 'hers' and 'theirs' present, the sources of conflict tended to
result from one set of children having a bad influence on the others, the type
of punishment invoked, or one particular child receiving too much
attention." <P>

      Rates of conflict are much higher outside intact marriage
families.  Not surprisingly, the rates of emotional and behavioral
problems of children are more than double in step families.  Given their
impact on children, the marriage arrangements of parents have significant
effects on the incidence of teenage crime.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #4:  The Lack of Parental
Supervision and Discipline </B>
<P>
     The absence of parental supervision and discipline often is due
simply to a lack of parenting skill, particularly if the parents were not
supervised properly by their own parents.  Summarizing the findings of the
Oregon Group, a team of social science researchers under the leadership of
Gerald R.  Patterson of the Oregon Social Learning Center, James Q. 
Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<UL>[I]n order for the parent to teach the child not to use force
     or fraud, the parent must 
   <P><UL> 
          monitor the child's behavior; 
     <P>
          recognize deviant behavior when it occurs; and 
    <P> 
          punish such behavior.</UL>
<P>
      All that is required to activate the system is affection for or
     investment in the child.  The parent who cares for the child
     will watch his behavior, see him doing things he should not
     do, and correct him.  Presto, a decent, socialized human
     being.</UL>
  <P>   
     Summarizing the Oregon Group's work on parental skills, Professor
Kevin Wright advises:  "Notice what the child is doing, monitor it over long
periods of time, model social skill behavior, clearly state house rules,
consistently provide some punishments for transgressions, provide
reinforcement for conformity, and negotiate disagreement so the conflicts
and crises do not escalate.  Monitoring children involves awareness of their
companions, whereabouts, and free-time activities.  It also includes
appropriate communication, accountability of the child to the parents and the
amount of time spent with parents."  A host of other studies confirm that
good supervision is at least as powerful as parental emotional attachment to
the child and other forms of indirect control.  Monitoring fills the child's
need for parental attention, moral education, and correction.
<P>
     The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later
criminal behavior.  One reason is that teenage single mothers monitor their
children less than older married mothers do.  They are more inclined to
have an inconsistent, explosively angry approach to disciplining their
children.  In such homes family members, including children, generally use
aggressive, coercive methods to make sure their needs are met by others in
the family.  The parent's inability to monitor a child's behavior
compounds the hostility between parent and child and leads to the first of
the two major stages in delinquency described by the Oregon Group: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The first stage is a] breakdown in family management
     procedures, producing an increase in antisocial behavior and
     an impairment in social skills and application at school.  [In]
     the second stage, during adolescence, these conditions
     continue and the disruptions in the parents' monitoring
     practices and the adolescent's own poor social skills place
     him further at risk for finding his community in a deviant
     peer group.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
      While parental monitoring and supervision obviously are good for
children, harsh or excessive discipline has just the opposite effect.  The
parents of delinquents are harsher than ordinary parents in punishing their
children; and depressed, stressed, or hostile parents more likely will vent
their anger on their more aggressive children.  In the case of the single
teenage mother, the absence of the father increases the risk of harshness
from the mother.  For these children, harsh punishment can mean parental
rejection.  "Punishment that is too strict, frequent or severe can lead to a
greater probability of delinquency regardless of parental attachments.  That
is, a strong parent-child bond will not lessen the adverse impact of
punishment that is too harsh."
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #5:  Rejection of the Child </B>
<P>
     Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of criminology at California State
University, writes:  "Research consistently has shown that those youth
whose bond to their parents is weak are more likely to be delinquent. 
[Y]outh who are more attached to their parents have greater direct and
indirect controls placed on their behavior."
<P>
     As a child's emotional attachment to his parents ensures a well-
adjusted adult, so parental rejection of the child has powerful opposite
effects.  Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
summarizes the research findings:  "Rejected children tend to distrust and
attribute malevolent motives to others, with the result being a defensive, if
not aggressive, approach to peer interactions.... Such [rejecting] parents not
only fail to model and reinforce prosocial behavior, they actually provide
training in aggressive noncompliant behavior."
<P>
     Rejection by the family, which is the child's first and fundamental
"community," sets the stage for another social tragedy.  Rejected children
tend gradually to drop out of normal community life.  Professor Simons
continues:  "Parental rejection... increased the probability of a youth's
involvement in a deviant peer group, reliance upon an avoidant coping style,
and use of substances."  Many other studies in the professional literature
replicate these findings.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #6:  Parental Abuse or Neglect </B>
<P>
     The professional literature is replete with findings of a connection
between future delinquency and criminal behavior and the abuse and neglect
visited upon children by their parents.  This abuse can be physical,
emotional, or sexual.  "Overwhelmingly," observes Patricia Koski,
"studies conducted since 1964 have found a positive correlation between
parent-child aggression-violence-abuse-physical punishment and aggression
on the part of the child."  Or, as summarized by Cathy Spatz Widom,
professor of Criminal Justice and Psychology at Indiana University,
Bloomington, "Violence begets violence."
<P>
     Studies of the official records of abused children and arrested
offenders put this connection in the range of 14 percent to 26 percent. 
But the connection triples to a range of 50 percent to 70 percent once
researchers go beyond official reports of investigated cases of child abuse
to reports of abuse by the delinquents themselves.
<P>
     Significantly, West Coast Crips and Bloods gang members almost
without exception grew up in dangerous family environments.  Typically,
they left home to escape the violence or drifted away because they were
abandoned or neglected by their parents.  Consequently, these young men
have developed a defensive world view characterized by a feeling of
vulnerability and a need to protect oneself, a belief that no one can be
trusted, a need to maintain social distance, a willingness to use violence and
intimidation to repel others, an attraction to similarly defensive people, and
an expectation that no one will come to their aid.  Young women
delinquents who run away from home are also frequently victims of sexual
abuse.
<P>
     The close connection between child abuse and violent crime is
highlighted also in a 1988 study of the 14 juveniles then condemned to
death in the United States:  12 had been brutally abused, and 5 had been
sodomized by relatives.
<P>
     Child sexual or physical abuse alone can outweigh many other
factors in contributing to violent crime but affects boys and girls differently. 
Abuse visited upon girls is more likely to result in depression (the inversion
of anger) or psychiatric hospitalization than in the more outwardly
directed hostility of abused males.  According to Cathy Spatz Widom,
"Early childhood victimization has demonstrable long-term consequences for
delinquency, adult criminality, and violent behavior.... The experience of
child abuse and neglect has a substantial impact even on individuals with
otherwise little likelihood of engaging in officially recorded criminal
behavior."
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #7:  Criminal Parents </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Patterns of crime are transmitted from generation to generation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In a longitudinal study of 394 families in England, David P. 
Farrington, professor of criminology at Cambridge University, found that
approximately 4 percent of these families accrued almost half of the
convictions of the entire sample.  "The fact that delinquency is
transmitted from one generation to the next is indisputable.... [F]ewer than
5 percent of the families accounted for almost half of the criminal
convictions in the entire sample.... In order to achieve such concentration of
crime in a small number of families, it is necessary that the parents and the
brothers and sisters of offenders also be unusually likely to commit criminal
acts."
<P>
The findings for England, though dramatic and for a different culture and
country, comport with the earlier U.S.  research as summarized by Professor
Kevin Wright of the State University of New York at Binghamton: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The Gluecks determined that delinquents were more likely
     than nondelinquents to have delinquent fathers and mothers. 
     Subsequent studies supported the Gluecks' findings,
     observing that delinquent boys were more likely to have
     delinquent or criminal parents.  In a study of the families of
     black delinquents in St.  Louis, Robins found that a child's
     delinquent behavior was associated with 1) arrests of one or
     both of the parents in their adult years, and 2) a history of
     juvenile delinquency on the part of the parents.  Children
     with two parents with criminal histories were at extremely
     high risk of delinquency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Girls involved in crime tend to mate with (if not marry) men with
criminal records.  Jill Leslie Rosenbaum of California State University,
describing young delinquent women in her study, states:  "[T]he men in the
wards' lives bore a striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal records."

<P>

<B> STAGE TWO:  JUVENILE DELINQUENCY </B>
<P><B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #1:  A Child's Rejection by
Other Children</B> 
<P>
     For most normal children, going to school is their first serious step
into the broader community.  But for future delinquents, this first experience
pushes them further down the spiral toward delinquency and crime. 
Because of their family experiences, these children already are aggressive
and hostile.  Normal, emotionally attached children avoid them -- in
effect isolating and rejecting them.  As a result, they seek compatible
company elsewhere, in a group where they feel they belong.
<P>
     As Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
writes, "Ineffective parents produce aggressive first graders who are rejected
by their peers and as a consequence must form friendships with other
deviant youth."  Likewise, Gerald Patterson of the Oregon Social
Learning Center says:  "Poor social skills, characterized by aversive or
coercive interaction styles, lead directly to rejection by normal peers." 
Patterson, the leading expert in this area, also makes the point that peer
rejection tends to be linked to ineffective parenting:  "Specifically, early
parent failures contribute to later skills deficits.... Parent skills in solving
family problems correlate significantly with measures of academic skill and
peer relations."  In a study of 1,224 grade school boys, James D.  Roff,
professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University, concludes that the
boy at highest risk of becoming delinquent "was characterized by aggressive
behavior in the context of peer rejection."
<P>
     Closed off from the community of their peers, future criminals search
out companions who feel comfortable with them.  Not surprisingly, these
companions are similarly aggressive-hostile children with whom they feel
at ease and by whom they are accepted.  The group thus reinforces its own
aggressive-hostile ways and gradually rejects the conventional ways of
normally attached children.  Continued disruption at home, parents'
continued use of harsh discipline, and the continued absence of a father
all add to the growing hostility of these future delinquents.  Association with
delinquent peers -- almost all of whom come from similar family and
parental backgrounds -- is the next significant development on the path to
habitual crime.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #2:  Failure at School </B>
<P>
     By the age of five or six, small children who are deprived of parental
love and supervision have become hostile and aggressive and therefore have
greater difficulty forming friendships with normal children.  This hostility
also undermines their school work and success.  Professor David P. 
Farrington's Cambridge University study finds a high correlation between
school adjustment problems and later delinquency:  "Youths who dislike
school and teachers, who do not get involved in school activities, and who
are not committed to educational pursuits are more likely than others to
engage in delinquent behavior."
<P>
     Future criminals tend not to have good verbal memory at school or
the ability to grasp the meaning of concepts, including moral concepts. 
They generally fail to learn reading and computation skills, undermining
their performance in the middle grades.  They often fail in the later grades
and have no or low aspirations for school or work.  They begin to be
truant and eventually drop out of school in their teens.  Typically,
before they drop out of school they already have begun a serious
apprenticeship in crime by having far higher rates of delinquency than do
those who graduate.
<P>
     Once again, all these problems are rooted in unfavorable family
conditions.  In a study on juvenile delinquency, Merry Morash, professor of
criminology at Michigan State University, analyzed four large data sets:  the
British-funded Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development and the U.S. 
federally funded National Longitudinal Study of Youth, National Survey of
Children, and Philadelphia Cohort study.  Examining these four large studies
of the development of children, particularly the connection between home,
education, and crime, she concludes:  "[The] mother's [young] age is related
to delinquency primarily through its association with low hopes for
education, negative school experiences, father absence, and limited
monitoring of the child."
<P>
     Consider the bleak impact of these family conditions on the future
of the education system and the next generation of students.  In the mid-
1980s, the Chancellor of the New York City school system was
complaining:  "We are in a situation now where 12,000 of the 60,000
kindergartners have mothers who are still in their teenage years, and where
40 percent  of our students come from single parent households."  But
since then, the national teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has grown by 50
percent, from 30 births per 1,000 unmarried teenage girls in 1982 to 45 per
1,000 in 1991.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #3:  The Growth of the Gang </B>
<P>
     Commenting on the work of all parents as their children enter
adolescence, James Q.  Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Affection and monitoring had better have done the job
     already, because the "child-rearing" days are over.  It is time
     to hope for the best.... [A] major feature of recent times is
     the increasing independence of adolescents from the family....
     This independence from the family results in increasing
     dependence of the adolescent on other adolescents.  But
     adolescents cannot take the place of parents as socializing
     agents because they have little or no investment in the
     outcome, and are less likely to recognize deviant
     behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     All children, especially during their teenage years, gravitate toward
the influence of their peers.  Not surprisingly, as the professional
literature shows, delinquent peers move a boy in the direction of
delinquency and crime.  The same is true for girls.
<P>
     In the company of their peers, future criminals gradually learn to
exploit the people of their own community, a community to which they feel
no responsibility or obligation.  For these boys, increasingly involved
with delinquent companions, their lives tend to become insulated from the
weakening influence of their families.  Continued weakness in parental
supervision, monitoring, and control invariably escalates the conflict at
home, and this increasing conflict and related family problems cause these
children to deepen their affiliation with delinquent groups, the only class of
people likely to welcome them "with a place to belong to."  While the
children continue their aggressive, hostile, and violent ways, their behavior
also increasingly repels normal, non-aggressive people.  They grow more
familiar and at ease with their delinquent peers.  Dropping out of school
is a natural development. 
<P>
 <B> STAGE THREE:  THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNITY </B>
<P>
     Criminal youth tend to live in high-crime neighborhoods.  Each
reinforces the other in a destructive relationship, spiraling downward into
violence and social chaos.
<P>
          The 1980s witnessed an extraordinary increase in community
violence in most major American cities.  In 1990, homicide in Boston
increased by over 40 percent over the previous year; in Denver, it rose by
29 percent; in Chicago, Dallas, and New Orleans, by more than 20 percent;
in Los Angeles, by 16 percent; in New York, by 11 percent.  In 1988,
nationwide firearm death rates for all teenagers for the first time exceeded
the total for all other natural causes of death combined, and black male
teens were 11 times more likely than their white counterparts to be killed
by guns. 
<P>
           According to the national survey data, there is a clear
correlation between the surge in criminal violence in these largely urban
communities and the collapse of marriage.  Professional research in
criminology also supports this conclusion.
<P>
          Tragically for these communities, single-parent neighborhoods
tend to be high-crime neighborhoods.  Researchers long ago observed that
violent crime, among both teenagers and adults, is concentrated most heavily
in urban neighborhoods characterized by a very high proportion of single-
parent families.  More recent figures indicate the illegitimate birth rate
in many urban neighborhoods is a staggering 80 percent.  And today's
researchers, like those before them, find that a neighborhood composed
mainly of single-parent families invariably is a chaotic, crime-ridden
community in which assaults are high and the gang -- " the
delinquent subcommunity"-- assumes control.  In these chaotic
conditions, parental supervision of adolescent and pre-adolescent children is
almost impossible.  In turn, children living in these neighborhoods are
more likely to learn, accept, and use physical violence to satisfy their wants
and needs.
<P>
          While serious crime is highest in these socially disorganized,
largely urban neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function of
race.  The determining factor is absence of marriage.  Among broken
families, with their chaotic, "dysfunctional" relationships, whether white or
black, the crime rate is very high.  Among married two-parent families,
whether white or black, the crime rate is very low.  The capacity and
determination to maintain stable married relationships, not race, is the
pivotal factor.  The chaotic, broken community stems from these
chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an important factor
in crime is the wide differences in marriage rates among ethnic groups.
<P>
     While the crime rate among blacks has risen sharply, so has the
disappearance of marriage.  The same holds true for whites.
<P>
     A recent report from the state of Wisconsin further illustrates the
same relationship.
<P>
          A high concentration of broken families without husbands and
fathers is the danger signal for future crime.
<P>
          Violent families, violent youth, and violent communities. 
<P>
Violent youth often come from violent parents.  Violent youth are the most
likely to have witnessed conflict and violence between their parents. 
They also are the most likely to commit serious violent crime and to
become "versatile" criminals -- those engaged in a variety of crimes,
including, theft, fraud, and drugs.  Among these youths, physically or
sexually abused boys commit the most violent offenses.
<P>
          Internal family violence is only one major contributor to
adolescent violence in these socially disorganized neighborhoods.  The
neighborhood itself (which includes the youth's violent peers, also rooted in
their own broken families) is the other powerful contributor, especially
to violent delinquency, and its culture of aggression and violence is
imported into the school.  Consider a recent report from the Centers for
Disease Control:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> More than 4 per cent of high school students in Grades 9-12
     had carried a firearm at least once in the past 30 days, and
     35.5 percent of those had carried six or more times during
     that period.  Thus, about 1.4 percent of high school students
     might be considered regular gun carriers.  Furthermore, more
     than 60 percent of the students surveyed in Baltimore
     reported knowing someone who had carried a gun to
     school.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Given the level of violence in their neighborhoods, for young
people to carry guns for self-defense is perhaps understandable.  And
the youth most likely to feel the need for defense is the member of a street
gang in a violent neighborhood.  After he has committed his first violent
crime, the evidence shows that he is likely to commit further crimes and
more than twice as likely as other criminal youths to commit more
violence.  Various studies indicate that violent crime is much more
likely to come to the attention of the police and lead to investigation and
arrest.  For example, Franklyn W.  Dunford and Delbert S.  Elliott of
the Behavioral Research Institute at Boulder, Colorado, find that young
violent criminals are more likely than others to be arrested. 
<P>
           As a result of the low arrest rate for criminals, even the
alarming official crime figures do not give policymakers a true picture of
what is happening in high-crime communities.  According to Dunford and
Elliott, 93 percent of those committing between 100 and 200 offenses
between 1976 and 1978 were not arrested, while 81 percent of the youth
responsible for more than 200 offenses during the same two-year period
were not arrested.  Explains Dunford:  "These data suggest that only those
at the extreme have any risk of arrest, and even that risk is not high.  It
appears that the volume of crime committed by these youth may be such
that arrest is a function of chance alone.  The police may, figuratively, be
stumbling over them.  The likelihood of arrest is close to zero until one
reports in excess of 100 total offenses."  Elsewhere in the same study,
Dunford reports:  "Of the 242 [career criminals] 86 percent had no record
of arrest.  In other words, the overwhelming majority of self-reported career
offenders were never arrested during a three year period when they were
involved in very frequent and serious criminal offenses."
<P>
          Given the very high frequency of undetected crime by career
(expert) criminals, the other dramatic finding from the Cambridge University
study of British delinquents may hold for the United States as well: 
that 50 percent of all crime probably comes from less than 5 percent of the
delinquents' families.
<P>
          The Family versus the "Hood." Two researchers from the
National Institute of Mental Health, John E.  Richters and Pedro Martinez,
have studied families in high-risk inner-city neighborhoods.  Their study
indicates that only 6 percent of children from stable, safe homes become
delinquent.  Meanwhile, 18 percent of children from homes rated as either
unstable or unsafe (broken marriage or lack of supervision) became
delinquent, but 90 percent of children from homes rated as both unstable
and unsafe became delinquent.  Only 10 percent did not.
<P>
          Such studies show that the family is fighting desperately with
the violent neighborhood for the future of its children.  The good news is
that even in violent and crime-ridden neighborhoods, "good families" are
winning the battle, though a 6 percent juvenile delinquency failure rate is
still a tragedy for them.  Even the troubled family is winning, with its 82
percent success rate, though the one-in-five delinquency rate means that
every second family has had a family member in jail.  Remarkably, even 10
percent of children from the most unstable and unsafe families somehow
survive and escape a life of crime.  The 90 percent delinquency rate
among their siblings may be inevitable, for these are the families with the
highest concentration of neglectful and abusive parents who would warp any
child.
     
     <P>

<B> Delinquent Girls </B>
<P>
     The discussion of delinquency generally focuses on boys because
most violent crime is committed by males.  But while male and female
delinquents have similar experiences, the quality of the intimate family
relations of delinquent females often is much worse.  They tend to be even
less attached to, and to have more problems with, their mothers than do
male delinquents.  They are even more firmly rejected by their female
school peers than are their male counterparts.  And, in turn, they are even
more firmly attached to their own "bad companions" -- the delinquent peer
group -- than are males to theirs.
<P>
          Professor Jill Rosenbaum of California State University paints
a graphic picture of the early life of a female delinquent.  The relationship
between family breakdown or disintegration and later criminal status is
dramatic:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> In 1980, records were requested on 240 women who had
     been committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA),
     the state agency for juvenile offenders.... Family Structure: 
     Very few (seven percent) of these girls came from intact
     homes families.... By the time these girls were 16, their
     mothers had been married an average of four times, and there
     was an average of 4.3 children per family.... Family
     Criminality:  seventy six percent of the girls came from
     families where there was a record of criminality.... Family
     Violence:  Although much data on family violence are
     missing, it is evident that violence was present in many of
     these homes.... Family Conflict:  In the two parent families
     (mainly step families) examined in this study a great deal of
     conflict was present.  Of these parents, 71 percent fought
     regularly about the children.  Since there were often his, hers
     and theirs present, the sources of conflict tended to result
     from one set of children having a bad influence on the
     others, the type of punishment invoked, or one particular
     child receiving too much attention.... Conflict over the use of
     alcohol was present in 81 percent of the homes.... Parent-
     Child Relationships:  A Poor relationship between parent and
     child is highly influential in the child's subsequent
     delinquency.... Many of the girls received very little positive
     feedback from parents in the home.  Of the fathers who were
     present, 53 percent were viewed by parole officers as
     rejecting of the girl, as were 47 percent of the mothers. 
     Rejection came in many forms.... The mothers appeared to be
     not only neglectful, but 96 percent were described as passive
     and 67 percent as irresponsible.... Generational Cycles:  The
     mothers of the CYA wards tend to marry young, with 44%
     having had the ward by the time she was 18.  These
     daughters tended to follow in their mothers' footsteps and
     begin bearing children at an early age.... Parents often
     encouraged this behavior.  One mother explained to her
     daughter's parole officer that she was happy to hear that her
     15-year-old daughter was pregnant --" That is what women
     are supposed to do."...  The men in the wards' lives bore a
     striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
     Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal
     records.... The Mothers:  The wards' mothers did not have
     the supports or resources needed to cope with their
     environments.  They often were socially isolated and
     distrusted those attempting to help.  They viewed welfare
     workers as those trying to take away funds and social
     workers as trying to take away their children.  These attitudes
     and fears began long before the wards were born perhaps
     even before their mothers were born.  The mothers of the
     CYA girls did not know how to be mothers, for they were
     often children themselves when their children were born, and
     lacked the emotional resources to instill a sense of trust and
     security necessary for self esteem and growth.  Over time,
     just trying to survive depleted whatever emotional resources
     they might once have had.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
<B> THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF A SAFE SOCIETY
</B><P>
     Most ordinary Americans do not need to survey the social science
literature to know that a family life of affection, cohesion, and parental
involvement prevents delinquency.  In particular, they know almost
instinctively that maternal affection, maternal self-confidence, and the
father's esteem for the mother are among the critical elements in raising
well-balanced children.  The literature bears out these common-sense
assumptions.  Most Americans, too, know that in a law-abiding family
the parents encourage the moral development of their children and promote
an understanding and acceptance of traditional moral norms.  Again, the
professional literature reinforces these common-sense maxims.  As Professor
Wright observes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The existing literature on the topic [of normative
     development] includes a study by Mak that found that a
     belief in law was negatively associated with several measures
     of delinquency for both boys and girls.  Mak further reported
     that feelings of empathy are inversely related to seriousness,
     vandalism, and assault for girls and cheating and assault for
     boys.  Agnew found that a belief that it is good to be
     honest and to avoid cheating was associated with a reduced
     likelihood of delinquency.  Smith and Paternoster
     discovered that moral beliefs reduced the likelihood of
     marijuana use among both males and females.  Paternoster
     and Triplettobserved that moral beliefs were related to
     both the incidence and prevalence of marijuana use, theft,
     and vandalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Moreover, most Americans know that this moral development
of children usually is accomplished within the context of religious belief and
practice.  The government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm this view.  To continue from Professor Wright's review of the
literature for the Justice Department: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Another study found that attachment to church was
     inversely related to violence.  And, finally Tolan found
     that the moral-religious emphasis within the family... was
     related to self-reported delinquency.
     <P>
     Rodney Stark says that delinquency rises or falls in a high
     school to the extent to which the high schools contain a
     majority of religious students.  This fits with the findings
     that among black men incarcerated and those not is that those
     who do not commit crime participated in church activities
     and had friends who went to church.  By contrast those who
     were incarcerated had deviant friends and did not go to
     church.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
 <B> The Crucial Elements </B>
<P>
     The root cause of violent crime thus is found in failed intimate
relationships of love in marriage and in the family.  The breakdown of
stable communities into crime-infested neighborhoods flows directly from
this failure.  In contrast, addressing the root causes of crime requires an
understanding of the crucial elements of supportive family and community
life.
<P>
First in importance and influence is the basic marriage commitment.  Its
vital importance is starkly evident in the catastrophic impact of its absence.
<P>
Second is the relationship of love between parents and children, a love
expressed primarily in supervision.
<P>
Third, stemming from the first and second, is the child's ability to relate to
other children.
<P>
Fourth, the backbone of strong neighborhoods, is friendship and cooperation
between families.
<P>
     It is no coincidence that one of the central rules in the traditional
moral codes of all communities at all times, in all places, and in all cultures
is the prohibition against giving birth to children outside of marriage. 
Societies all over the world have recognized that this prohibition is essential
to social stability and to raising members of each new generation with the
proper respect for their community and their peers.  Unfortunately, and with
disastrous consequences, this prohibition is ignored today in American
society at all levels, but most especially in central-city neighborhoods. 
Having a child outside of marriage virtually guarantees a teenage woman
and her children a life of poverty, low education, low expectations, and low
achievement.  It gradually puts in place the conditions which foster rejection
and, ultimately, crime.
<P>
          Whenever there is too high a concentration of such broken
families in any community, that community will disintegrate.  Only so many
dysfunctional families can be sustained before the moral and social fabric
of the community itself breaks down.  Re-establishment of the basic
community code of children within marriage is necessary both for the future
happiness of American families and for a reduction in violent crime.
<P>
          It follows, then, that the real work of reducing violent crime
is the work of rebuilding the family.  Institutions in the community, such as
the church and the school, have demonstrated their importance in helping to
restore stability.  Government agencies, on the other hand, are powerless to
increase marital and parental love; they are powerless to increase or
guarantee care and attention in a family; they are powerless to increase the
ability of adults to make and keep commitments and agreements.  Instead,
thanks to policies that do little to preserve the traditional family and much
to undermine it, government continues to misdiagnose the root cause of
social collapse as an absence of goods and services.  This misdiagnosis is
government's own contribution to the growth of crime.  Having
misdiagnosed, it misleads.
<P>
          There is an irreplaceable role for political leadership in the
current crisis.  It is not to take the place of family and community,
however, but to articulate a compelling, positive vision of the nation in
terms of family and community life.  As President John F.  Kennedy
inspired thousands of young people to serve others overseas, another must
inspire today's youth to rebuild America's families and community.  This
is the work not of government, but of the nation's primary nurturing
institutions:  family, church, and school.  The missions of these institutions
are missions of love and the moral and the spiritual formation of a people.
   <P>       The alternative is continued social disintegration.  
<P>
<B> WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO </B>
<P>
Hold hearings on the real causes of crime.
<P>
     Given the disconnect between the assumptions behind the social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994 and the real root causes of
crime, a major correction in thinking is needed.  The Judiciary Committees
of Congress should conduct a series of hearings on the root causes -- the
long-term causes -- of crime.  These should focus on the relationship of
family structure, and particularly of marriage and religious practice, to the
prevention of violent crime.  The literature, the scholarship, and particularly
the experience are wide and deep.
<P>
Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.
<P>
     Congress ought to conduct a comprehensive review of all national
social programs, inviting the director of each program to present the
evaluation data on the program's effectiveness (or lack of it) in reducing
crime.
<P>
Commission geographical mapping of social problems and their related
conditions.
<P>
Congress should require the Departments of Health and Human Services,
Justice, Labor, and Commerce to provide it with geographical mapping of
the conditions known to be related to crime and other social problems. 
Among the problem indices that should be mapped:
<P>
The different types of crime;<BR>
Drug use;<BR>
Long-term welfare dependency (over two years);<BR>
School performance;<BR>
Out-of-wedlock births;<BR>
Domestic violence, by types;<BR>
Child abuse;<BR>
Sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
<P>
     Congress also should require information to examine the relationships
between other social indicators and the lack of crime.  Among the social
strengths that should be mapped:
<P>
Presence of intact primary marriages (comparing these with alternative
family structures, from blended families of different types to different forms
of single-parent families);
<P>
Attendance of adults and children at religious institutions;
<P>
Religious education indices (attendance at religion-based schools and at
supplementary religion classes);
<P>
Volunteer activity in social service associations.
By mapping at the smallest geographical unit possible (county, zip code, or
even smaller), many research benefits can be derived.
<P>
Request research on the effects on children of the intergenerational
transmission of the single-parent family structure.
<P>
     Congress ought to request summary descriptive and comparative
research on how the children of first, second, third, and fourth generation
single-parent families fare on indices of health and development, as well as
social competence, during and by the end of their growing years.  While we
do have some knowledge of the impact of out-of-wedlock birth and
single-parent family life on children, we do not know about multiple-
generation effects.  This knowledge could be very salutary.
<P>
Reform the welfare system.
<P>
     Welfare today is a destructive Faustian bargain between all potential
mothers and the government.  As the condition for receiving cash -- as
opposed to real community support -- the system requires that women and
girls abandon the traditional moral code.  Explains Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector:  "The woman has a contract with the
government:  She will continue to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she
fulfills two conditions:  1) She must not work; and 2) She must not marry
an employed male."
<P>
     Whatever good intentions were served by the welfare system, the
evidence shows that its perverse financial incentives discourage the
formation of intact families and the pursuit of work.  These are the
outcomes of the current "community code" on which high-crime
neighborhoods are built.  Thus, current government policy is a powerful
facilitator of the long-term rise in the crime rate.
<P>
     Legislation is needed to end the destructive features of the welfare
system.  Instead of sending paychecks to single mothers, such a reformed
system should channel money to local institutions and levels of government
that can pull the mother toward helping groups in the community and pull
the community toward the mother and child in need of help.
<P>
     Legislation introduced by Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) and
Representative James Talent (R-MO) (S.2134 and H.R.4566) in the 103rd
Congress takes these necessary steps and would foster a different community
code.  Money now used to support these broken and unformed families
could be given instead to the local community to allow it to decide how best
to help families in need, including newly formed, father-abandoned
families.  The community could disburse this money, at its discretion,
to organizations committed to rebuilding the lives of these broken families.
<P>
Promote -- through leadership in ideas, not national funding --
volunteer community efforts, including the efforts of religious
institutions.
<P>
     Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods, there are
stunning examples of successful efforts to turn around the lives of young
people previously immersed in crime.  These efforts invariably possess two
features.  One is a strong system of rules within an organization
characterized by the love and firm guidance seen in a supportive family. 
The other is a strong spiritual dimension, most commonly a profound
religious commitment. 
<P>
      Examples of this type of program abound.
<P>
     Example:  Leon Watkins of South Central Los Angeles, convinced
that gangs fill a void for those who join them, helps them do it in a way
that bridges to society.  According to Watkins, being in a gang is like a
religious commitment; there are codes of conduct and service to a higher
good than oneself:  the gang itself.  Watkins shows gang members how to
be true to all that attracts them to the gang and yet be true to themselves
and society around them.  The spiritual inspiration behind all his efforts
becomes clear to the youth.  They learn how to become aware of the
spiritual dimension of their lives.
<P>
     Example:  The Reverend Lee Earl started a church in one of the
most desolate sections of Detroit, a neighborhood whose economy was built
on drugs, prostitution, and welfare.  Within a decade the same neighborhood
and the same inhabitants, under the inspiration of the spiritual leadership of
Rev.  Earl, motivated by a trust in God, had rebuilt their community.  They
became married families, started small businesses, and rebuilt and bought
out their own homes.  Crime plummeted and a community was reborn.
<P>
     Giving people a place to belong and hope in a future, hope
communicated through inspiring leadership, is common to all these
successes.  Giving a neglected child a place to belong -- someone to belong
to -- is communicated through the spirit of a giving person, something
beyond social work alone.  It involves a long-term personal relationship with
a child.  These relationships do not take money, but they do take a generous
commitment of personal time, as in Big Brothers and Big Sisters. 
Government cannot purchase these efforts.  If it tries, it will vitiate them by
turning moral relationships into monetary ones.
<P>
Promote, through leadership in ideas, the benefits to the nation of
regular worship at religious institutions.
<P>
     The importance of codes of conduct and religious practice can hardly
be overstated.  According to the professional literature, active participation
in a church significantly correlates with decreased incidence of crime. 
Expansion of active church membership and religious worship in a
community contributes to the reduction of crime.
<P>
     Government cannot re-empower religious institutions, for their
essential nature is moral and spiritual.  But it can be less hostile to their
traditional areas of competence and mission.  The potential for good among
many religiously inspired schools, especially in America's inner cities, is
well-known.  But Congress and the courts insist that the price of
government cooperation in education is noncooperation among the three
nurturing institutions of family, church, and school.  This strategy weakens
communities.
<P>
Conduct inner-city experiments with school vouchers.
<P>
     Schools that maintain discipline and strong moral values can help
support families that value these virtues and may make a difference in
communities that have broken down.  Parents need to be able to select such
schools when their children are at risk.  To give parents this choice, states
and localities can be encouraged to offer vouchers to lower-income families. 
So far states have resisted conducting these experiments.  The federal
government ought to finance and evaluate six to twelve such local
demonstrations.
<P>
     Recent poll data in California and New Jersey confirm the general
pattern of support for vouchers:  not surprisingly, it is the poor who most
want vouchers for private schools for their children.  The poor well
understand the importance of good schools in giving young people in crime-
ridden neighborhoods the chance for a productive life.  Private and religious
schools have the major advantage of being able to instill and enforce a
moral code for teachers, children, and parents.  This is just the help that
parents in fragile, crime-ridden communities desperately need.  In the battle
between the family and the "Hood," such schools can be crucial allies for
parents.  Vouchers provide the constitutional and financial means for this
close and effective cooperation between school and family in the moral
formation of children.
<P>
Remove barriers to adoption.
<P>
     Many children would have the benefit of a stable, two-parent family
-- reducing the probability that they would descend into crime -- if adoption
were made easier.  Unfortunately, there are many frustrating barriers to
adoption. 
<P>
      The largest barrier is the ethos of the social services establishment,
which discourages adoption as the preferred option for a young unmarried
mother and her child.  The best way to deal with this is to provide
competition by allowing other institutions to provide adoption services.  One
of the best competitors could be the nation's churches, which have great
outreach to young pregnant women and to couples desiring to adopt.  Black
churches are particularly well poised to perform this function and are likely
to take care of balancing the needs of the child in racial matching of the
parents where possible while also ensuring a speedy adoption, no matter
who the parents are.  However, liability law needs to be changed to remove
obstacles to churches, particularly small churches, wishing to provide this
natural form of charity.
<P>
Reduce taxes on marriage and children.
<P>
     The federal tax code discriminates against the institution of marriage
and the raising of children.  Since the early 1950s, the tax system each year
has increased the tax burden at a much faster rate on families raising
children than on any other form of household.  Talk of "family" values
is largely meaningless if it does not address this central economic
relationship between government and family, a relationship that will always
be there, no matter the levels of social problems.  A government intent on
doing its limited best in the long-term prevention of crime will adjust its tax
code to reflect the fundamental importance of stable marriage to the social
order.
<P>
     The federal government can and should reform features of the tax
code that hurt families with children -- particularly low-income working
families.  One such egregious feature is the "marriage penalty" on fathers
and mothers who move from cohabitation to married family status.  Another
step Congress can take is to enact tax credits or other tax relief for parents
with children.  Adjusting the tax system to benefit the intact family silently
but powerfully upholds marriage and the family.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The professional literature of criminology is surprisingly consistent
on the real root causes of violent crime:  the breakdown of the family and
community stability.  The sequence has its deepest roots in the absence of
stable marriage.
<P>
          Despite the good news that overall crime rates have dropped
in recent years, the frightening news is that both the level and viciousness
of teenage violent crime have been rising steadily.  More ominous still, this
was set in motion sixteen to eighteen years ago, when these violent
teenagers were born into chaotic family and social conditions.  Since then
these conditions have become more prevalent, and we will see a continued
rise in violent teenage crime.  Furthermore, America is headed toward a 50
percent out-of-wedlock birthrate sometime in the next twelve to twenty
years, inching more and more of the country closer to today's inner-city
illegitimacy rate.  If this trend is not reversed, Americans must prepare for
extensive and serious erosion of public safety and practical freedoms.
<P>
          Government can staff and manage the criminal justice system
efficiently and prevent crime in the short term by locking up violent teenage
criminals so that they are no longer a danger to others.  But it lacks both the
capacity and competence to tackle the root causes of crime.  That is the
mission of three other basic institutions of society:  the family, the church,
and the school.  For close to five decades government has increasingly
burdened these institutions -- has even become hostile to them.  It is now
time to help these institutions fulfill their missions by reversing course and
removing these burdens.
<P>
     However, it will take real leadership -- leadership through ideas and
passionately meant words -- to inspire us all to cooperate in rebuilding our
marriages, families, neighborhoods, and communities. That is the appropriate
work for America's political leaders and statesmen.

IT'S TIME TO THROW THE SWITCH ON THE FEDERAL CRIME BILL </h3>

<p>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B><P>
     Over the last three decades violent crime in America has
increased by more than 500 percent. The United States leads the
industrialized world in rates of murder, rape, and violent crime.
Nearly three out of every four convicted criminals are not
incarcerated. And fewer than one in ten serious crimes results in
imprisonment. Behind these statistics is, of course, human carnage. In
our inner cities in particular, the body count continues to mount.
This is the inevitable, tragic result of a breakdown of the moral
order and of our criminal justice system.
  <P>   The American public will not accept widespread lawlessness
indefinitely. If violent crime continues to rise, then people will at
some point look for a police state to restore order. Our free
democratic institutions cannot withstand much more crime without a
terrible counterreaction. Social anarchy often triggers an
authoritarian backlash.
    <P> We must regain control of our streets. The first responsibility
of government, after all, is the security of its citizens. The
relevant public policy question is: How do we once again provide basic
security? And here a caution is in order: Passage of the current crime
bill is not synonymous with achieving safe streets. Flawed legislation
wrapped in good rhetoric is still flawed legislation. A close analysis
of the crime bill demonstrates where it falls short. (See Paul J.
McNulty, "Rhetoric Versus Reality: A Closer Look at The Congressional
Crime Bill," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 189, May 16,
1994.)
  <P>   Regardless of their rhetoric, Members of Congress are not going
to cure America's epidemic of violent street crime with the enactment
of a federal crime bill. Street crime is largely a matter of state and
local law enforcement; indeed, more than 98 percent of all such
violent crimes falls under the jurisdiction of state and local law
enforcement authorities. But more important, Members of Congress are
using the crime issue as a pretext for doing what they do best:
increasing federal spending on social programs. In this instance, they
are increasing social spending on everything from midnight basketball
leagues to arts and crafts programs. And while legislators are using
ruthless rhetoric against violent criminals, they are seriously
considering the establishment of a racially based, death penalty quota
system ensuring that the imposition of the death sentence is
effectively ended at both the state and the federal level. Indeed, the
measure now before Congress would likely further emasculate the
independence and the authority of state and local law enforcement
officials in fighting violent street crime.
 <P>    Instead of a fundamentally flawed crime bill, which pointlessly
federalizes local street crime, state and local officials should be
empowered and given the resources to combat violent criminals, locking
up felons for their full sentence and ending "revolving door justice."
Instead of establishing a new federal "anti-crime" regime, Congress
should aim at maximizing state and local flexibility, while stopping
the intrusion of the federal judiciary in the administration of state
prison systems. Instead of hamstringing state and local law
enforcement with new federal regulations, Members of Congress should
make changes in federal law to stop the endless appeals of convicted
violent felons and encourage state and local officials to adopt the 24
effective anti-crime measures recommended by former Attorney General
William Barr. (For more information on these recommendations, see Mary
Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a
Safer America," Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 944/S, June
7, 1993.)
  <P>   And finally, Members of Congress can really help in a tangible
way by giving state residents a federal tax rebate proportional to
increased state spending to fight violent street crime at the state
and local level.
<P>
<B> SOME GOOD PROVISIONS </B><P>
     Given Americans' growing fear of violent crime, it is
understandable that Members of Congress would want to support another
federal crime bill, even if it falls far short of effective
legislation. The House and Senate versions of the bill have "truth in
sentencing provisions" which would require violent criminals to serve
at least 85 percent of their time. (James Wootton, "Truth in
Sentencing: Why States Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time,"
Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
If actually funded, these provisions would incapacitate large numbers
of violent criminals. But in the inevitable congressional horsetrading
on Capitol Hill, new social programs are likely to be more politically
potent than new prison space.
   <P>  On key issues, the House and Senate are far apart on the details.
Proposed federal money for state prisons amounts to $13 billion in the
House bill and $3 billion in the Senate version. And there is also
federal money for hiring community police ($9 billion in the Senate
version, and $3.5 billion in the House bill). But even if Members of
Congress agree on the right funding formulas, there is yet no adequate
funding mechanism in the crime package. Currently, Members of Congress
are considering a special trust fund created by the elimination of
252,000 federal jobs over the next five years. This funding provision
appears in the Senate bill; the House bill has no funding mechanism at
all. Thus, Congress can promise funding for anti-crime measures, but
without an explicit and effective funding mechanism, the entire
congressional anti-crime enterprise could become another rhetorical
exercise.
<P>
<B> A BATCH OF BAD IDEAS </B><P>
     While American taxpayers are promised more police on the streets
and more prison space for violent criminals, the major effect of the
federal crime bill is to federalize violent street crime, burdening
state and local authorities with even more federal rules and
regulations while making them increasingly dependent on Washington's
largesse. For example:
<P>
More Social Spending. 
 <P>    In spite of the fact that Washington has racked up a record of
failure in social programs, the House version of the crime bill
contains roughly $9.2 billion in Sixties-style social programs to
"prevent crime." This includes $40 million for business partnerships
administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
midnight basketball with federal rules even detailing the composition
of neighborhood teams, "self-esteem" classes, arts and crafts, dance
classes and physical training programs, and "conflict resolution"
training.
<P>
Outcome-Based Executions. 
  <P>   In the House version of the bill, a provision called the "Racial
Justice Act" would enable a person convicted of a capital crime to
invoke statistical evidence that his execution would reinforce a
pattern of racial discrimination. Moreover, the burden is on the state
to prove it was not discriminating in imposing the death penalty. And
because the provision is retroactive to all those now on death row --
a total of 3,800 -- it could tie up the courts for years. Indeed, a
California case where the convict used such a defense took over three
years -- at a cost of $1 million -- before the state could execute the
sentence. But the worst feature of this provision is the message that
it sends: race, not the crime, would be the most important factor in
the imposition of the death sentence. The result: a death sentence
could be invalidated by irrelevant data.
<P>
More Federal Intrusion Into State Law Enforcement. 
  <P>   Virtually all violent street crime is under the jurisdiction of
state and local government. State legislators, not Members of
Congress, have primary responsibility for combatting violent street
crime. Yet in the Senate version of the bill, more crimes are added to
the federal crime code. For example, trafficking in stolen credit
cards, defrauding a person of more than $1,000 in credit card
stealing, telemarketing fraud, and increased street gang activity are
to be put under federal jurisdiction. In the meantime, the House
version of the bill has added 66 new federal death penalties, coupled,
of course, with the House adoption of the "Racial Justice Act" to make
sure they are never actually carried out. And while Members of the
House of Representatives have been posturing on the death penalty, the
Clinton Administration has been cutting back on federal law
enforcement agent strength, both at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
This is, of course, a recipe for bitter cynicism on the part of
America's taxpayers.
<P>
More Federal Control Over Local Police. 
 <P>    Both the White House and Capitol Hill are committed to increasing
the number of police. While the Clinton Administration has asked for
100,000 more police officers, the House version contains 50,000
additional slots. While no personnel decision is more important than
the hiring of a cop -- a job where individual merit is paramount --
the House bill calls for state and local authorities to adopt racial,
ethnic, and gender guidelines in police hiring. While these are not
explicit quotas, in practice they are likely to become so, especially
given the heavy dependence on centralized federal financing. Over 88
percent of the funding is controlled not by states and localities, but
by the Executive Branch. And because the funding for these police
slots will end in five years, localities will either have to cut their
police force, a politically unattractive option, or lobby Washington
for even more federal funding and concomitant federal control.
<P>
<B> A BETTER IDEA </B>
   <P>  American taxpayers are not going to feel safer because Congress
talks tough on crime, while it increases spending on arts and crafts
for juvenile delinquents. While there are good provisions in the
Senate and House package, the heavy mixture of bad proposals or a
variation of them are certain to survive in the congressional
logrolling that normally characterizes House and Senate conference
business.
<P>    Instead, Members of Congress should do it right. They should
recognize that combatting violent street crime is a state and local
responsibility. They should target their efforts to helping the state
and local police upgrade the detection and apprehension of criminals,
and assist state and local authorities in prosecuting and
incarcerating violent criminals. 
<P>     Toward this end, Members of Congress should: 

Establish a special trust fund for the states to fight crime. 
    <P> Under a proposal by Representative James Sensenbrenner (R-WI),
H.R. 4592, Congress would set aside an amount equal to 2 percent of
the personal income tax revenues, and rebate it to the states to cover
increased state expenditures to combat violent crime. State
expenditures would include spending on police, construction of the
operation of prisons, and other aspects of the state criminal justice
system, including truth in sentencing. The Sensenbrenner proposal
would rebate between $45 billion to $55 billion to the states to fight
crime over the next five years.
<P>
Eliminate federal judicial micromanagement of state prison systems. 
 <P>    Congress can restrain federal judges from arrogating wide-ranging
administrative powers to themselves, overriding state executive and
legislative authorities, and imposing "prison caps" that result in the
early release of criminals.
<P>
Reform key federal rules governing the criminal justice system. 
 <P>   This would include habeas corpus reform, to prevent convicted
felons from tying up the court systems with endless appeals. Such
reform would also include establishing a "good faith" exception to the
exclusionary rule, meaning criminals would not be able to beat the rap
because the police secured otherwise solid evidence in a technically
imperfect search and seizure operation.
<P>
     While Members of Congress could assist state and local
authorities in very tangible ways, there is no reason why the Justice
Department could not publish a "Wall Chart," comparing states and
localities with each other, with a rank ordering of their performance
in combatting violent crime, including arrests, convictions,
imprisonment, and adherence to truth-in-sentencing standards. With a
way to compare performance, taxpayers could bring pressure to bear on
lax state and local officials far more effectively than through the
ministrations of federal officials.
  <P>  In the meantime, Members of Congress should refrain from talking
tough about violent street crime while they promote policies that
would only further erode their already damaged credibility. Instead,
they should salvage the few sound policy options left in the crime
bill, and make a fresh start on a tough problem.
 <P>    Of course, we should not allow the discussion of legislation to
obscure the most obvious points. The best approach to crime control is
to keep young people from ever falling into the criminal justice
system in the first place. We now ask prisons to do what fathers once
did and ask the entire criminal justice system to do what parents,
schools, and neighborhoods once did. More broadly, as a society we
simply need to become more civilized. I say "simply" because there is
a tendency to over-intellectualize our task or to throw up our hands
in despair. Intelligent, tough-minded public policies can help achieve
greater domestic tranquillity. But in the end, regeneration in a free
society must come from within. We need to revivify old republican
virtues like self-control, prudence, honor, and fidelity to
commitments. They have been, and remain, the cornerstones of civil
society.
     <P>

<h3>
RHETORIC VS. REALITY: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL CRIME BILL </h3>

By Paul J. McNulty<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

Issues Bulletin No. 189<br>
May 16, 1994<br>

<p> 


<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     If Americans think that Congress is going to be effective in
fighting violent crime, they are likely to be disappointed.
Congressional rhetoric on violent crime is very tough, but the reality
of the anti-crime legislation is very different. Major differences
between versions of federal anti-crime legislation await resolution by
Senate and House conferees as they attempt to reconcile the crime bill
passed by the Senate last November (S. 1488 and S. 1607) and the one
approved by the House last month (H.R. 4092).
<P>
     While both versions of the bill and related measures contain
superficially attractive language on such items as increased police
presence, bans on "assault weapons," and the federal "three-strikes-
and-you're-out" provision, it is a safe bet that the bill which
finally reaches the President's desk will not reduce violent crime.
For example, the "get-tough" provisions, including an expansive new
death penalty for about sixty different federal crimes, would be used
exclusively by a shrinking federal law enforcement team which deals
with just a tiny fraction of all violent crime. In 1990, state courts,
not federal courts, handled over 98 percent of all violent crime
convictions. (See "The Crime Bill: Much Ado About Nothing," National
Center for Policy Analysis Brief Analysis No. 106, April 15, 1994.)
Thus, in dealing with the violent street crime that plagues so many
inner-city residents, these elaborate death sentence threats will go
largely unused. Moreover, the House version of the crime bill contains
a racial quota system (the so-called Racial Justice Act) that would
make the imposition of the death penalty virtually impossible.
Complains Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, ranking Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, "While pretending to get serious about
crime, they have inserted into the House crime bill a set of
provisions that would in effect abolish the death penalty nationwide
-- both at the federal level and among the states." (Senator Orrin
Hatch, "Dear Colleague," April 25, 1994.) 
<P>
      The one truly useful proposal, billions of new dollars for state
prisons, is the target of substantial liberal congressional
opposition. If opponents are successful in the conference committee,
even this reasonable proposal likely will be of little benefit to
Americans desperately seeking relief from the continuing scourge of
violent crime.
<P>
     In fact, expectations are so low that many knowledgeable analysts
simply hope that the federal crime bill will do no harm to the
existing criminal justice system, a tragic testimony to the lack of
political leadership in Washington. The fact that the "Racial Justice
Act" is being seriously considered reveals the legitimacy of such
concerns.
<P>

<B> WHAT TAXPAYERS NEED IN THE CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     Nevertheless, while the shape of the congressional response to
violent crime may not inspire confidence, it may still be possible to
salvage sound policy prescriptions and have a meaningful crime bill
this year. Such a bill would have as its primary focus the goal of
providing maximum assistance to the states in their battle against
violent crime. It is the states, not the federal government, that bear
the greatest responsibility for combatting violent crime. Moreover,
federal policies, particularly requirements tied to federal grants,
should not hamstring state and local law enforcement officials.
Accordingly, the final crime package should contain provisions that
include:
<P>
1)  Federal funding for imprisonment of violent criminals. At least
    $10 billion should be available to the states for the construction
    and operation of state prisons as an incentive for them to reform
    their sentencing laws. This would make the bill's "truth in
    sentencing" provisions a reality, ensuring that violent criminals
    serve their time. (For an excellent discussion of "truth in
    sentencing," see James Wootton, "Truth in Sentencing: Why States
    Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time," Heritage Foundation
    State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
 <P>

2)  A serious death penalty. This means establishment of a federal
    death penalty for truly federal crimes -- a death penalty that
    will not take more than a decade to carry out after sentence is
    imposed. 
<P>
3)  A restraint on federal courts that put violent criminals back on
    the streets. This would mean, as a matter of federal policy,
    cutting back on prison population caps and other controls imposed
    by federal courts on state prison and local jail systems.
 <P>
4)  Improvements in the prosecution and punishment of federal violent
    crimes, particularly sexual assaults. This would include
    increasing penalties for violent federal crimes and expanding the
    range of admissible evidence in federal sexual assault cases,
    especially to serve as models for state law.
<P>
5)  Restoration of the strength of federal law enforcement agencies.
    While talking tough on crime, the Clinton Administration has cut
    agent and prosecutor strength in such key federal law enforcement
    agencies as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Drug
    Enforcement Administration (DEA). If Congress is serious about
    toughening federal law enforcement, this policy should be
    reversed. 
<P>
 <B> WHAT TAXPAYERS DO NOT NEED IN A FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In fashioning a new federal crime policy, Congress must make sure
that it does no harm to the efforts of state and local law enforcement
officials. This means:
<P>
1)  No death penalty quotas. The "Racial Justice Act" included in the
    House version of the crime bill would enable a prisoner convicted
    of a capital crime to offer statistical evidence that imposition
    of a death sentence in his case would be racially discriminatory.
    Such data would automatically require the state to prove that
    racial discrimination was not involved, imposing a burden that
    would be difficult, if not possible, to overcome unless the
    government previously had established a quota system based on
    local racial demographics. Under the terms of the House bill, this
    would be applied retroactively, in effect giving convicted felons
    yet another avenue of appeal to avoid the death penalty. This new
    system of "Outcome-Based Executions" would undermine the principle
    of individual justice.
<P>
2)  No new federal rules hamstringing state law enforcement. This
    includes, for example, the House-passed "Repeat Violent Offender
    Incarceration Act," which, while sounding innocuous enough,
    actually may require states to "assure" that they are reducing
    prison time for drug traffickers. 
<P>
3)  No new federal rules governing state and local police work. This
    includes congressional restrictions on federal funding for police
    officers that would have the effect of turning cops into social
    workers. Under no circumstances should federal policy encourage
    any kind of hiring or promotion quotas for police officers. As
    Representative James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who
    is the ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Crime and
    Criminal Justice, observes, the House version of the crime bill
    recommends that states and cities "seek and recruit members of
    racial, ethnic and gender minority groups." (Rep. F. James
    Sensenbrenner Jr., "A Real Crime Crisis and A Fake Crime Bill,"
    The Washington Times, April 6, 1994, p. A-19.) No personnel
    decision in the criminal justice system is more important than the
    hiring of a police officer, whose individual merit -- especially
    courage, judgment, integrity, and intelligence -- is critical in
    making life and death decisions. 
<P>
4)  No expansion of taxpayer funding of social programs. Liberals in
    Congress view public anxiety over crime as an excellent reason to
    fund more government social programs. The House bill contains $8
    billion worth of social welfare spending, (Ibid.) even though most
    taxpayer funding for social programs has little or nothing to do
    with genuine law enforcement. The bill includes funding for such
    things as arts and crafts programs and basketball leagues, replete
    with absurd federal requirements governing youth basketball
    participation. It is even more remarkable that Members of Congress
    would resort to social welfare spending in combatting crime when
    one considers that such spending is now at all-time high and that
    welfare spending per capita, in constant dollars, is five times as
    high as in 1965, the beginning of the "Great Society." (See Robert
    Rector, "Combatting Family Disintegration, Crime and Dependence: 
    Welfare Reform and Beyond," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
    983, April 8, 1994, p.5.) 

<P>
<B> THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In May 1989, President George Bush unveiled his comprehensive
violent crime control proposal to a large gathering of police
officers. President Bill Clinton hopes soon to stand before a similar
audience to announce completion of this process started five years ago
by his predecessor. (The Crime Control Act of 1990 was not viewed as
important anti-crime legislation. It included only provisions that
enjoyed the unanimous support of the conferees. Thus, despite lopsided
victories in the House and Senate on President Bush's proposals, the
final bill was largely a wasted effort.) Before this can happen,
however, Congress must agree on the details of this complex and
politically divisive legislative package. To that end, House and
Senate conferees are working to resolve many crucial policy
differences between their respective bills.
<P>
     In resolving these differences, Members of Congress must answer
three basic and critically important policy questions:
<P>
1)  How should the federal government spend $22 billion to combat
    violent crime in America?
<P>
2)  What should be the role of federal law enforcement in relation to
    violent street crime?
<P>
3)  To what extent should the federal government involve itself in the
   administration of capital punishment at the state level?
<P>
     If the conferees reach a consensus on these three questions, they
will have resolved the most significant issues presented to them by
the federal crime legislation, including whether to spend money on
prisons or so-called prevention programs, whether to expand federal
law to cover nearly all crimes involving firearms, and whether to
impose insurmountable burdens on prosecutors in states with capital
punishment.
<P>

<B> WHERE WILL TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS GO? </B>
<P>
     The crime legislation authorizes huge amounts of new federal
spending whose targets are easily identified: police, prisons, or
prevention.
<P>
     When the Senate passed its crime bill last November, it created a
violent crime reduction trust fund of $22 billion from anticipated
savings over the next five years from attrition in the federal
workforce. How to spend this $22 billion will present some tough
choices for the conferees. Making matters even more difficult, the
House bill includes nearly $28 billion in new spending. In fact, taken
together, the two bills include nearly $40 billion worth of ideas.
Some of the ideas are good, some are bad, and others are simply
irrelevant to the serious task of fighting violent crime. 
<P>
     The major spending proposals are:
<P>
     $9 billion (Senate bill) and $3.5 billion (House bill) for "cops
       on the beat."
<P>
     $13 billion for state prisons (House bill), $3 billion for
       regional prisons (Senate bill), $4 billion for correctional
       options and alternatives to prison (Senate bill).
<P>
     $9 billion (House bill) and $1.2 billion (Senate bill) for
       miscellaneous crime prevention/social programs, many of which
       fall under a new program entitled the "Ounce of Prevention"
       initiative.
<P>
     The Police. The Clinton Administration seems most interested in
securing federal money for police and prevention. The President
promised 100,000 more police in his election campaign and continues to
emphasize this issue in his crime speeches. At least three key
problems remain, however, concerning the benefits and nature of this
initiative. First, how can financially strapped local jurisdictions
pay the 25 percent matching fund requirement in both bills and afford
the cost of keeping the new police on board as the federal
contribution steadily declines? Second, will local governments retain
genuine control over hiring decisions and the type of work that the
new officers will perform, or will the federal government require
these individuals to fit into a mold pre-designed in Washington, where
many see community policing as another form of social welfare service?
Third, how will the criminal justice system handle the violent
criminals added to the pipeline as a result of more arrests (assuming
Washington allows them to make arrests)? There are about 550,000
arrests for violent crime in the entire nation each year, and one
violent crime arrest each month by an additional 100,000 police would
more than double the current number.
<P>
     Attorney General Janet Reno has championed the "prevention"
programs ever since she arrived in Washington. She appears convinced,
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that traditional social
welfare programs will strengthen families and reduce juvenile crime.
And even though the public is generally favorable to making violent
criminals serve their full time, a change that requires greater prison
capacity, the attorney general is no advocate of additional prison
capacity.
<P>
     If the conferees follow the Clinton Administration's lead with
regard to community policing, they will be left with about $30 billion
of additional programs and only $13 billion of the original $22
billion available to spend. This will result in one of two outcomes:
1) a confrontation between supporters of money for prisons and
proponents of more social welfare spending under the guise of
"prevention" spending or 2) the familiar dodge whereby Members of
Congress merely authorize spending on all of the proposals, leaving it
to congressional appropriators to make the hard choices and decide in
the years ahead who gets real money.
<P>
     Prisons vs. Prevention -- A False Dichotomy. Any confrontation
between prisons and prevention should involve a serious discussion
about the nature of crime prevention. Congressional proponents of more
social spending insist that more prisons will not reduce crime;
instead, federal legislation must be aimed at the "social conditions"
from which violent criminals often emerge. Representative Cardiss
Collins (D-IL), clearly expressed this view on the House floor during
the crime bill debate: "Any crime measure that budgets more for
prisons than job training is not sufficient to the task of fighting
crime."
<P>
     Once again, congressional liberals are wrong. Drawing a
distinction between prisons and prevention poses a false dichotomy.
Removing violent criminals from the streets is crime prevention, as
relevant statistics prove. For example, recidivism declines when
younger violent criminals serve longer percentages of their prison
sentences, (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (NCJ-116261), April 1989, p.
3.) repeat offenders commit a large number of crimes when they are out
of prison, (U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the
Federal Armed Career Criminal Statute, March 1992, p. 29.) and there
is an inverse relationship between rates of incarceration and rates of
crime. (U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Policy Development, The
Case for More Incarcerations (NCJ-139583), October 1992, p. 10.)
<P>
     The preventive effect of incarceration also is supported by the
four basic purposes for prison: incapacitation (the offender obviously
cannot commit crimes against law-abiding citizens when he is in
prison), retribution (justice is strengthened when offenders pay their
debt to society), deterrence (offenders are less likely to commit
crimes if the punishment is swift and severe), and rehabilitation.
There is widespread debate among students of the American criminal
justice system as to the effectiveness of rehabilitation, but this
issue also represents an area of potential agreement for pro-prison
and pro-social welfare advocates. And while retribution may involve
philosophical considerations and deterrence may turn largely on
empirical data, there can be no doubt about the value of
incapacitation in preventing crime. Anyone who has been victimized by
someone who should have been in prison at the time -- and there are
perhaps thousands of such victims each day -- can testify to the
certainty that imprisonment prevents crime.
<P>
     More Social Welfare Spending -- In a Crime Bill? It is beyond
dispute that an enormous variety of social programs, including welfare
spending, continue to receive a major portion of government spending.
These programs include urban and community aid, social services,
training and jobs, housing, education and energy assistance, medical
assistance, food stamps, and cash assistance. As Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector has noted, "From the start of the
War on Poverty in 1965 to the present, welfare spending has cost the
taxpayers $4.9 trillion in constant 1992 dollars. This is greater than
the cost of defeating Germany and Japan in World War II, after
adjusting for inflation." (Rector, op. cit. p. 6.) Thus, the argument
that government has ignored social spending as a means of attacking
the "root causes" of crime is inconsistent with the facts. (It is
true, of course, that federal policy makers have failed to address the
"root causes" of crime in terms of exploding illegitimacy, family
disintegration, and the collapse of traditional values in many crime-
ridden communities.)
<P>
     Congressional opponents of more prison spending claim that
building prisons has not reduced crime because crime has not declined.
This is akin to arguing that using a bucket to bail a leaking boat
does not reduce the amount of water in a boat with a hole in the
bottom because the water is still coming into the boat -- never mind
that the boat would sink without using the bucket. If a lack of
concrete results for dollars spent is the basis for embarrassment,
congressional advocates of another round of Great Society-style social
spending should have the good sense to break off the public
discussion.
<P>
     What Kind of Prevention Programs Are They, Anyway? Finally, it
must be observed that many of the programs being proposed are an odd
assortment of social programs that appear to be the product of "pop"
psychology. Under the House version of the crime bill, Congress would
authorize spending taxpayers' money for arts and crafts, Olympic
training, self-esteem classes, conflict resolution training for
violent teens, and midnight basketball leagues. Naturally, federal
programs mean federal rules which, in the case of the new midnight
basketball leagues in the House bill, are neat and precise: each
league must have eight teams with no more than ten players on each
team, and half of the players must live in government-subsidized low-
income housing projects. In a country where the average murderer
spends only eight-and-a-half years behind bars because of insufficient
prison capacity, it is curious to insist on spending limited taxpayer
dollars on arts and crafts.
<P>

<B> THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT </B>
<P>
     The second question Members of Congress must address concerns the
role of federal law enforcement in combatting street-level violence.
Both crime bills, but particularly the Senate version, contain several
new offenses and penalties aimed at such crime. In addition to death
penalty offenses for murder with a firearm, drive-by shootings, and
car-jackings, the bills establish new crimes for gang activity,
criminal use of firearms, and juvenile crime. Provisions relating to
sexual and domestic violence would be enforceable only on federal
lands such as Indian reservations.
<P>
     The much-discussed "three-strikes-and-you're-out" provision would
not expand the jurisdiction of federal law enforcement, but it would
increase the penalty for conviction of a federal violent crime after
two similar federal or state convictions. President Clinton has
developed an attractive "tough on crime" soundbite in pushing for this
penalty, but the reality is that current federal law already severely
punishes such offenders.
<P>
     It used to be easy to spot the difference between the role of a
Member of Congress and the role of a state legislator in crime
legislation. The Constitution clearly distinguishes between the
national responsibilities of the general government and the domestic
and particular responsibilities of state governments. State
legislators, not Members of Congress, have direct responsibility for
enacting the rules that govern state and municipal law enforcement. 
<P>
           In the 1980s, Congress spent most of its legislative energy
focusing on drug abuse, grant programs to assist state and local law
enforcement, and procedural reforms affecting federal prosecutors.
Within the past few years, however, the direct involvement of federal
law enforcement in countering urban violence has emerged as a major
issue. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) initiated much of the debate in
1991 with an amendment that would give federal law enforcement
jurisdiction over nearly all crimes committed with a gun. This idea is
very popular in Congress. D'Amato's amendment has passed the Senate
twice by overwhelming margins. Not surprisingly, it also has been
strongly opposed by many prominent conservatives, including Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
<P>
     Meanwhile, as the legislative debate has continued, federal law
enforcement has become ever more involved in the fight against street
violence. Since possession of a firearm by a felon is a violation of
federal law, it has been relatively easy for the federal government to
arrest and prosecute tens of thousands of violent criminals. This new
role has been well received in states where violent crime has soared
and criminal justice systems have been largely dysfunctional. For
example, local law enforcement officials in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, have praised federal authorities for the aggressive role
they played in attacking drug trafficking gangs from 1989 to 1992; the
federal government was able to "lean forward" and assist a local
government that was unable to detain offenders pre-trial because of a
court-imposed cap on its jail population.
<P>
     Notwithstanding the success of high-impact operations like the
one in Philadelphia, Members of Congress should be cautious about
continuing to expand federal jurisdiction. Once again, virtually all
violent crime enforcement falls upon state, not federal authorities,
and there is an ample menu of specific policy initiatives that state
officials can pursue in controlling violent crime. Former Attorney
General William Barr has outlined two dozen specific recommendations
that would help state officials combat violent crime. (For an
excellent and detailed discussion of the Barr recommendations to state
and local officials, see Mary Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent
Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a Safer America," Heritage Foundation State
Backgrounder No. 944/S, June 7, 1993.)
<P>
     There are several other reasons why Members of Congress should be
cautious in expanding the federal role in combatting domestic street
crime.
<P>
     First, limited resources will not permit greater involvement by
federal law enforcement. Generally lost in all of President Clinton's
rhetoric about fighting crime are his significant cutbacks in federal
law enforcement. There are hundreds fewer agents and prosecutors now
than there were in the Bush Administration. Moreover, the President's
proposed budget for FY 1995 seeks to cut prison construction by 30
percent (adding to a sharp cut in 1994) and Department of Justice law
enforcement agencies by 1,523 positions. Former Deputy Attorney
General Philip Heymann summarized the Clinton Administration's policy
by stating that, "With fewer federal investigators and fewer federal
prosecutors in the years ahead there will not be more federal law
enforcement but less.... " (Philip B. Heymann, "The Lock-'em-up
Debate; What Pols Won't Say: 3 Strikes -- And We're Out of Money," The
Washington Post, February 27, 1994, p. C1. ) It would be misleading
for Congress to expand the federal role in law enforcement while
following the lead of the Clinton Administration by slashing the
resources of these law enforcement agencies. Meaningless rhetoric on
the crime issue only adds to the taxpayer's discouragement with
government; both Members of Congress and state legislators should
recall that the first duty of government is to protect American
citizens, not simply to talk tough about crime. 
<P>
      Second, Congress should avoid passing laws that continue to
undermine the distinction between federal and state jurisdiction
regarding street crime. Given the independent nature of United States
Attorneys, it is likely that some would attempt to operate like local
district attorneys. Furthermore, elimination of the federal-state
distinction runs counter to the notion of a limited federal government
acting only in accordance with enumerated powers. While such a
traditional notion of constitutional law is hardly the guiding
influence of Washington's current policy-making process, the loss of
even more ground in this area must be avoided.
<P>

<B> ENDING STATE DEATH PENALTIES </B>
<P>
     The third question that Members of Congress must resolve pertains
to the imposition of capital punishment at the state level. By the
slimmest of margins, the House passed the so-called Racial Justice
Act, which purports to remedy racial bias in the administration of
state death penalties but which actually would end the death penalty
not just for future cases, but also for all offenders currently under
sentence of death.
<P>
     According to the provisions of this remarkable proposal, if a
defendant offers statistical information indicating a disparity
between the race of the offender or the victim in a capital case and
the racial composition of the general community, a presumption of
racial bias is established. At this point, the prosecutor must prove
there was no discrimination. In other words -- in violation of the
canons of logical debate -- the government must prove a negative. Even
if evidence is presented that is relevant to the government's reason
for seeking the death sentence, it will not respond fully to the
possibility that racial prejudice was an additional factor. Moreover,
the prosecutor must do this retroactively, recovering evidence from
potentially thousands of cases dating back to the re-establishment of
capital punishment in 1976. Prosecutors agree that this measure will
lead to an injustice far worse than the one its sponsors now think
exists. To avoid the statistical disparity which triggers the
presumption of bias, the government will be forced to keep track of
the racial composition of offenders and victims and to make sure that
such composition matches that of the local community. This quota
system is completely contrary to the basic principles of the American
criminal justice system: that justice is color-blind and that every
case must be judged on its own merits.
<P>
     If Members of Congress accept this proposal, they will further
damage the criminal justice system. Even worse, the realization by
citizens and state law enforcement officials that Congress has imposed
this system on them, it will further erode the credibility of Congress
as an effective institution of government, underscoring the difference
between the tough rhetoric of Congress's latest war on crime and the
legislative reality of its latest anti-crime package.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     To craft a truly effective anti-crime policy, Members of Congress
ideally would need to start from scratch, beginning with the
recognition that state legislators have primary responsibility for
fighting violent street crime. Streamlining the court systems,
enacting rational sentencing laws, and improving the quality of police
recruiting and police detection of crime are all within the
jurisdiction of the several states.
<P>
     A serious federal anti-crime policy would have as its main focus
the elimination of every form of federal interference in the crucial
mission of public safety by the states. Through unfunded mandates that
consume their scarce fiscal resources, the federal government forces
states to divert funds from public safety. Because of activist federal
judges who micro-manage state prison systems and continually grant new
legal opportunities to death row inmates, states remain handcuffed in
their struggle against violent criminals. These are the problems that
should be addressed in federal anti-crime legislation.
<P>
     In the meantime, Congress can salvage good policy in a measure
that otherwise holds little promise of reducing the violence on
America's streets. First, in apportioning federal funds, Congress
should set aside not less than $10 billion as an incentive fund for
the states to encourage sentencing reform. States must stop revolving
door justice by increasing the amount of time served by violent
criminals from the current 38 percent to something much closer to 100
percent. Second, not one dime should be spent on more misguided social
welfare programs. Members of Congress should reject the advice of
those who still insist, despite two decades worth of evidence to the
contrary, that violent criminals also are victims of society to be
helped through more social spending. It is time for Members of
Congress to start listening to the real victims of violent crime.

<h3>
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE BROOKS AND BIDEN CRIME BILLS </h3>

By Paul J. McNulty<br>

Issues Bulletin No. 184<br>
November 8, 1993<br>

<p>


<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>
     The fear and frustration gripping America because of violent
crime is the direct result of one tragic fact. A dysfunctional
criminal justice system continues to release extremely dangerous
career criminals into the community when they should still be in
prison. The common factor in nearly every violent crime receiving
widespread publicity, including the recent murders of Florida tourists
and the killing of basketball star Michael Jordan's father, is that
the suspects were previously convicted of violent crimes, yet had soon
been permitted to return to the streets. Arrest, conviction, and
imprisonment did not stop them. (Half of all current state prisoners,
approximately 350,000 inmates, have three prior felony convictions,
"Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     This is why President Bill Clinton's plan to combat violent
crime, now being considered by Congress, completely misses the mark.
The main features of the President's plan are contained in legislation
offered in the House (H.R. 3131) by Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat,
who is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and in the Senate
(S. 1488, S. 1607) by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat, who heads
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<P>
     The House and Senate bills supported by Clinton ignore the real
problem by merely proposing to:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Add only 60,000 more police across the entire country over the
     next six or more years;
<P>
     Control gun possession for everyone except violent criminals, for
     whom getting guns will remain easy;
<P>
     Overturn landmark Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
     enforcement;
<P>
     Offer more spending promises, amidst a deficit crisis, on
     programs for non-violent offenders and unnecessary study
     commissions; and
<P>
     Establish softer penalties than President Bush's plan would have
     done for gun crimes by violent criminals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Yet the Brooks and Biden bills do not target the root cause of
the wave of violent crime -- the career criminals who are not kept off
the streets. Among the most serious problems with these bills and the
Clinton plan:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> One-third of Clinton's promised new police positions are not for
     police officers at all, and many others will not be available for
     many years. Moreover, the bills do not indicate where the money
     for community policing positions will come from. And more police
     to deter crime in some neighborhoods is no substitute for longer
     incarceration of career criminals.
<P>
     The bills authorize billions of dollars for "boot camps" and
     other "alternative" punishments, and for drug treatment programs
     within prison walls. Yet drug treatment programs show limited
     effectiveness, and money spent on treatment and alternative
     punishment means less money available for building prison space
     to keep career violent criminals off the streets.
<P>
     While they increase the number of crimes subject to the federal
     death penalty, the bills contain death penalty procedures that
     will make it difficult, if not impossible, to impose the death
     penalty.
<P>
     The bills contain habeas corpus reforms that likely will spur
     more petitions, not fewer.
<P>
     The Brooks bill would automatically give a violent criminal a new
     trial when an invalid confession was used in the original trial,
     even if such use had a harmless effect.
<P>
     The bills drop all the mandatory minimum sentence provisions for
     serious firearms offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill, and S. 1607 repeals mandatory sentences for certain
     drug offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>    Competing Republican measures avoid these deficiencies. These
bills, based on the original Bush crime bill introduced last year,
would, among other things, spend $3 billion over the next three years
on new regional prisons to house the most dangerous violent criminals.
These alternative bills recognize that only a partnership between
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies which targets the
most dangerous criminals, particularly those who use firearms, and
removes them from the streets will give Americans real security from
the threat of violent crime.
<P>

<B> A DECADE OF WEAK CRIME LEGISLATION </B>
<P>
     Congress is frequently accused of being enmeshed in gridlock,
unable to produce legislation on important matters of public policy.
When it comes to crime legislation, however, this criticism is seldom
heard. Indeed, anti-crime legislation has been a consistent exception
to Congress's "productivity" problem over the past decade. On this
subject, there has been no lack of desire or ability to produce new
laws. 
<P>
     Lawmakers have responded to the public's growing fear of crime by
passing four major federal crime bills in less than a decade. (The
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and the Crime Control Act of
1990.) A fifth bill came within a few votes of reaching President
Bush's desk last year. Together these bills have added hundreds of new
crimes, penalties, and procedures to the U.S. Code. Most
significantly, the combined effect of this legislation, coupled with a
dramatic increase in the federal law enforcement budget, (Spending for
federal law enforcement rose by nearly 60 percent in the Bush
Administration.) has greatly expanded the role of the federal
government in the fight against violent crime and drug trafficking.
<P>

<B> The Truth Behind the Signing Ceremonies
</B><P>
     Despite this apparent agreement between Republicans and Democrats
on the importance of fighting crime and drug abuse, sharp differences
have remained unresolved on the most important criminal justice
issues. A bipartisan coalition of moderate and conservative members in
both houses still has been unsuccessful during the past decade in
winning passage of their three top priorities. These are a
comprehensive federal death penalty, habeas corpus reform (limiting
repetitious legal challenges by death row inmates), and exclusionary
rule reform (by allowing in-court use of evidence seized without a
warrant by police officers acting in good faith).
<P>
     These three reforms so far have been blocked by a small liberal
group of highly influential lawmakers despite the support for the
measures by large majorities in both houses of Congress. The group has
been able to do this because they are high-ranking members of the
House and Senate Judiciary Committees. For example, on several
occasions over the past ten years, proposals to reform the
exclusionary rule have been adopted by the House, and habeas corpus
reform amendments have won approval in the Senate. Yet with the
exception of the death penalty for murderous drug traffickers, a
narrowly tailored provision that was passed in 1988, no amendment
concerning these three major issues has ever survived a House-Senate
conference. 
<P>

<B> The New Strategy </B>
<P>
     Apparently fearing that their blocking tactics might no longer be
successful, the Judiciary Committee liberals devised a new strategy in
1991. Rather than relying solely on obstruction, they offered their
own versions of these proposals. Their legislation had the same titles
as the anti-crime amendments, but in reality were quite different.
What was called habeas corpus reform, for example, turned out to be a
plan to gut current law by overturning more than a dozen Supreme Court
decisions which had established some limitations on habeas corpus
petitions. 
<P>
     In the end, the strategy worked. Many Members of Congress and the
media became so confused by the complicated legal debates over the
differing proposals that they did not appreciate the real effect of
the measures. As a result, in 1991, the Senate agreed to a "reform" of
the exclusionary rule offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden. This amendment actually restricted, not expanded, the current
admissibility of certain evidence. Later that year a liberal version
of habeas corpus reform passed the House by a few votes. Judiciary
Committee Democrats wasted no time in crafting a conference report
containing these destructive amendments, among other anti-law
enforcement proposals. President Bush fiercely opposed the conference
report and announced he would veto it if it was not significantly
amended. As a result, this "crime bill" died in the Senate in 1992
after several attempts to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster.
<P>
     This is the same crime bill that President Clinton has endorsed
and now serves as the core of H.R. 3131, introduced by Representative
Jack Brooks, and S. 1488 and S. 1607, introduced by Senator Joseph
Biden.
<P>
     Unlike Presidents Reagan and Bush, President Clinton has chosen
not to transmit to Congress an actual legislative proposal. Instead,
he held a press conference this August at which he outlined five
components of crime legislation that Congress should approve. The
crime bills introduced by the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Judiciary Committees largely include the President's five elements.
<P>
     The President chose this unusual course for two apparent reasons.
First, his support for the 1992 crime bill conference report made it
unnecessary to fashion a new bill from scratch. Any new ideas, such as
grants for more police, could simply be added to the 1992 bill.
Second, forming a new bill would have required the agreement of at
least four parties -- the White House, the Justice Department,
moderate Democrats such as Senator Biden and Representative Charles
Schumer, the New York Democrat who is Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Crime and Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee, and
liberal Democrats such as Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and
Representative Don Edwards of California, who is Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights. Given Attorney
General Janet Reno's personal opposition to the death penalty and her
preference for social programs addressing the "root causes" of crime,
agreement on a new crime bill would have been extremely difficult. By
deferring to the preferences of Chairmen Brooks and Biden, the
President at least temporarily avoided a clash within his own party. 
<P>

 <B> THE PRESIDENT'S FIVE PRIORITIES </B>
<P>
     President Clinton has called on Congress to pass a crime bill
containing at least the following five elements:
<P>
1.   More Police;
<P>
2.   Gun Control;
<P>
3.   Boot Camps and Drug Treatment;
<P>
4.   Federal Death Penalty; and
<P>
5.   Habeas Corpus Reform

<P>



<B> Element #1: More Police </B>
<P>
     Putting 100,000 more police on America's streets was the
centerpiece of candidate Clinton's anti-crime message during his
presidential campaign. This promise apparently was well received by
the voters. Even though George Bush had an exceptionally strong record
on law enforcement, he did not maintain an edge over Clinton on the
crime issue -- in contrast with Bush's battle with Michael Dukakis in
1988.
<P>
     The President's plan for adding 100,000 police includes the
following specifics:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> An additional 50,000 new officers over the next six years in
     community policing programs, at a cost to the federal government
     (in addition to state and local costs) of $3.4 billion (Senator
     Biden increased this to 60,000 officers and $5.2 billion in S.
     1607;
<P>
     Between 4,000 and 5,000 "Police Corps" officers after 1999, when
     they complete four years of government-supported college
     education (The federal government's cost: $100 million);
<P>
     An additional 4,000 security guards and police officers for
     public schools over five years, at a federal cost of $475
     million;
<P>
     An additional 5,000 security guards and police officers for
     public housing over five years at a federal cost of $700 million;
<P>
     Up to 25,000 "National Service" participants (college students)
     working in law enforcement-related fields for one or two years;
<P>
     Between 6,000 and 7,000 officers for community policing in
     "Empowerment Zones" and "Enterprise Communities," at a cost to
     the federal government of $500 million; and
<P>
     An additional $10 million for the Labor Department to retrain up
     to 1,500 former military personnel for police positions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Analysis: The Administration argues that more police will
suppress crime because criminals are less willing to break the law in
the presence of police officers. More suppression means less crime and
fewer arrests, which will alleviate some of the burden currently
weighing down the criminal justice system.
  <P>   Supporters of the President's plan also point out that community
policing, in particular, has become an extremely useful program for
developing stronger ties between police and the communities they
serve. The visible presence of law enforcement officers "walking the
beat" not only discourages potential law breakers, but it also gives a
sense of security to citizens.
<P>
     A closer examination of this proposal, however, reveals at least
the following three serious flaws:
<P>
Flaw #1: It is too little, too late. As much as one-third of the
proposed 100,000 new positions
     are not police officers. The list includes up to 35,000 unsworn
     security personnel and "National Service" students who are
     serving one or two years in public safety organizations to pay
     back college loans. These individuals are not authorized to make
     arrests, and most will not be engaged in confrontations with
     criminals. This is hardly what Americans expected when they
     expressed strong support for more "cops on the beat."
     Furthermore, approximately 5,000 of the new police officers who
     would come from the Police Corps program will not be on the job
     until 1999 at the earliest, because they must complete four years
     of college education before they begin service. 
<P>
Flaw #2: The money may come from other law enforcement programs. There
is a big difference
     between an authorization to spend money for state and local law
     enforcement and an actual appropriations bill containing the
     funding. The President's proposal would merely give permission to
     congressional appropriators to search for some extra money to
     fund the police programs. The Brooks and Biden bills propose
     nearly $3.4 billion to $5.2 billion over five or six years for
     just half of the 100,000 police jobs, and there are several other
     expensive provisions in the bills. Yet, federal funding for state
     and local anti-crime grants have been frozen at slightly less
     than $500 million for the past three years. So if Congress is to
     expand the level of financial assistance for state and local
     government without violating its overall budget constraints, the
     money likely will have to come from the federal law enforcement
     budget -- which has already been targeted by the Clinton
     Administration for sharp reductions.
<P>
Flaw #3: More police alone will not keep criminals off the streets.
Perhaps the most significant
     flaw with merely promising more police is that it fails to
     address the real problem. Suppressing crime through more police
     seeks to stop crime the same way locks on doors, bars on windows,
     citizen patrols, and anti-car theft devices do. They reduce the
     opportunities for criminals. But there is a hard core of career
     criminals on the streets; they are not easily deterred, and they
     are the main cause of the crime wave. As long as they continue to
     be released from prison long before their sentences have been
     served, Americans will not enjoy genuine security. To keep these
     criminals off the streets -- rather than merely dissuade them
     from operating in certain neighborhoods -- requires more
     prosecutors, judges, and prisons.
<P>
     With more police on the streets, more arrests will and should be
made. This places an increased burden on the courts, prosecutors, and
prisons. But the President ignores the entire criminal justice
pipeline. Ironically, when the system receives more offenders than it
can handle, more offenders must be "let off" in various ways (such as
dropped charges, plea bargains, and probation). Criminals then can
return to the streets with greater confidence in their ability to
"beat the system." 

<P>
<B> Element #2: Gun Control </B>
<P>
     The second element of the President's anti-crime plan is gun
control. Clinton has challenged Congress to enact the Brady Bill, a
proposal named after President Reagan's Press Secretary, James Brady,
which would establish a national waiting period for background checks
of handgun purchasers. He also has proposed a ban on the importation,
manufacture, sale, and possession of so-called assault weapons.
Analysis: The debate over the Brady Bill, which is a provision of the
Brooks bill only, is largely a symbolic one. Those supporting the
Brady bill are cast as being "for" a tough measure to deny guns to
criminals. Those opposing the bill are said to be "against" that goal.
<P>
     In reality, the legislative differences between the gun control
and the anti-gun control forces are minor. The Brady Bill would
establish a five working-day waiting period for the purchase of a
handgun, during which time local law enforcement officials would be
able to conduct background checks on the prospective gun buyers. These
checks would include a search of the criminal history records
currently available to law enforcement agencies at the state and
federal levels. 
<P>
     Major improvements in the automation and accuracy of these
criminal history records would permit fast and reliable access. When
this is achieved, or after five years, whichever is sooner, the Brady
Bill's waiting period requirement would sunset, because by that time a
background check could be conducted almost instantly. Lawmakers
opposed to the Brady Bill favor an instant check system. Their
proposal calls for the development of an automated system over the
next five years for determining, at the time the handgun is being
sold, whether the buyer is a convicted felon. The only difference is
that no national waiting period would exist during this period of
time.
<P>
     Since many Americans already live in jurisdictions with either a
waiting period or some other preferred method to screen gun buyers,
the actual effect of the Brady Bill would be minimal. The real
difference between the two sides has more to do with underlying
philosophies for dealing with violent crime. Many gun control
supporters believe crime is the result of the environment within which
criminals live. They cite such factors as the availability of guns,
television violence, and economic and educational deprivation. The
anti-gun control proponents, on the other hand, are more interested in
the accountability of the violent criminal.
<P>
     In the case of a ban on assault weapons, the 101st and the 102nd
Congresses dealt with this issue at great length. Assault weapons, as
defined by past legislation, are the semi-automatic firearms popular
with violent criminals because of their menacing appearance. Among the
features of such weapons are folding stocks, pistol grips, large
ammunition clips, and bayonet attachments.
<P>
     The controversy over the proposal to ban the weapons arises from
the inability to define, to the satisfaction of most lawmakers, the
words "assault weapons." Aside from their appearance, assault weapons
actually are no different from any other semi-automatic firearm. The
simple fact is that all semi-automatic firearms function in the same
way. Opponents argue that a ban might eventually and easily be
expanded to include many more popular types of semi-automatics, such
as widely owned target shooting and hunting rifles.
<P>
     So strong is this objection that neither the Brooks nor the Biden
bill includes a proposal on assault weapons.
<P>
<B> Element #3: Boot Camps and Drug Treatment </B>
<P>
     The third component of President Clinton's anti-crime plan is an
expansion of boot camps and drug treatment for prisoners. The Brooks
and Biden bills authorize $600 million and $800 million respectively
in new spending for "boot camps" and other "alternative punishments"
at the state level. The bills also propose "residential drug
treatment" grants of $300 million over three years for state prisons,
and they require federal prisons by 1997 to provide drug treatment to
every prisoner with a substance abuse problem. State prisoners under
the age of 29 would be eligible for the alternative punishments
programs even if they are violent criminals.
Analysis: The shortage of federal funding for state law enforcement
programs is by far the biggest problem with the boot camps and drug
treatment proposals. The President has said that funding for more
police is his top priority. But there will be difficulty in finding
money even for that, let alone these other measures. It is very
doubtful, therefore, that any money will be available in practice for
these new projects. Law enforcement officials at the state and local
level will be particularly irritated if funding for drug treatment is
taken from programs that support their anti-crime efforts. 
 <P>    The provision concerning residential drug treatment for federal
prisoners raises a more serious funding problem. This section requires
the federal Bureau of Prisons to provide by 1997 the opportunity for
residential drug treatment to every prisoner with a substance abuse
problem. By the end of fiscal year 1995, at least 50 percent of this
goal must be achieved, and by the end of 1996, the requirement
increases to 75 percent. If Congress does not provide additional
funding to the Bureau for this mandate, other Bureau programs may
suffer --  such as prison construction, which already has felt
substantial reductions.
<P>
     As for drug treatment grants to the states, it is important to
note that treatment for prisoners already is widely available. A third
of all state inmates have participated in drug treatment programs
while in prison, and among those who had used a drug during the month
before their current offense, nearly half received treatment after
entering prison. ("Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     While some may argue that this is short of what is needed, it
must also be understood that treatment is often unsuccessful. A 1991
survey of state prisoners who had used drugs during the month before
their crime, for example, found that 31 percent had been in treatment
before and 25 percent had been in it twice. (Ibid.) Moreover, the
prospect of serving prison time in a "residential treatment" program,
defined as confinement "set apart from the general prison population,"
may have the effect, at both the federal and state level, of drawing
prisoners who are marginally in need of treatment but attracted to the
"soft time."
<P>
     Finally, some serious consideration should be given to the
proposal that federal tax dollars be used for putting young violent
offenders into "alternative" corrections programs. Releasing such
criminals into community-based programs poses real risks to public
safety.

<P>
<B> Element #4: The Death Penalty </B>
<P>
     The President has called for the enactment of a comprehensive
federal death penalty as his fourth priority. He supports the 1992
crime bill death penalty language that contained more than fifty
capital offenses. The Biden and Brooks bills have slightly fewer
offenses because the death penalty for drug kingpins was dropped from
both bills at the insistence of the Justice Department. The reason is
that the provision would have permitted the death penalty for a major
drug kingpin convicted solely of trafficking extremely large
quantities of drugs. No proof of a specific murder would have been
required.
<P>
     Analysis: One criticism often leveled against a federal death
penalty is that it is largely symbolic because nearly all murders are
in violation of state law and fall outside federal jurisdiction.
Indeed, many of the federal capital offenses found in H.R. 3131,
S. 1488, and S. 1607 are extremely limited in their reach, such as
terrorist murders or assassination of the President. However, a few of
the offenses in the Biden and Brooks bills could apply widely. For
example, imposing the death penalty for killing with a firearm in the
course of a federal violent crime or serious drug trafficking offense
could apply to much of the violence now occurring on the streets of
nearly every city in America.
<P>
     This proposal does prompt objections among those concerned about
principles of federalism. The aggressive use of such a federal death
penalty would tend to lead to a more frequent use of the death penalty
in states where capital punishment rarely, if ever, occurs. Thus a
state reluctant to impose the death penalty would, in effect, be
overriden by the federal government.
<P>
     Federalists need not worry, however, about the Democrats' death
penalty proposal. Capital punishment at the federal level will occur
only when the statutory procedures allow. And the Biden and Brooks
bills contain death penalty procedures that will make it difficult, if
not impossible, actually to impose a death sentence.
<P>
     First, the bills allow for "standardless jury discretion." This
means that any juror can block the sentence of death, regardless of
how aggravated the crime may have been. This is inconsistent with
current law, which permits juries to be instructed that a death
sentence must be imposed if they determine that the aggravating
factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (See Boyde v. California, 110
S.Ct. 1190 (1990) and Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 110 S.Ct. 1078
(1990).) 
<P>
     Second, the procedures contain no habeas corpus limitations.
Thus, federal capital defendants can endlessly delay their executions,
as most state prisoners currently do. The habeas reform proposals in
H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S. 1607, as ineffective as they are, apply
only to state prisoners. 
<P>
     Third, the bills prohibit federal prosecutors from using elements
of an offense as aggravating factors. As an example, consider a case
of a person convicted of murdering a child in the course of violating
the federal law against child sexual abuse. Under the Brooks and Biden
bills, the government could not use the fact that the victim was a
child as an aggravating factor -- contrary to current law. (See
Lowenfeld v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988).)
<P>
<B> Element #5: Habeas Corpus Reform </B>
<P>
     The last element of the President's anti-crime package is habeas
corpus reform. In his August statement, the President drew attention
to a bill introduced by Senator Biden which is now incorporated into
S. 1488 and S. 1607. He described the bill as a "breakthrough" because
it enjoys the support of district attorneys, state attorneys general,
as well as Administration officials. The President characterized the
Biden proposal as one which "will, for the first time, limit inmates
to filing a single, federal habeas corpus appeal within a six month
time limit." It will also, he said, require death penalty states to
provide every indigent capital defendant with a team of highly
qualified and experienced defense lawyers.
<P>
     The Brooks bill also contains a habeas corpus proposal, which
differs in some important aspects from the Biden version. One key
difference is that H.R. 3131 substantially expands the control and
influence of activist criminal defense lawyers in matters relating to
the representation of indigent capital defendants.
Analysis: The battle over habeas corpus reform in recent years has
been extremely complex and divisive. At its root, the debate is about
the extent and nature of federal court review of actions by state
criminal justice systems, actions which involve difficult legal and
constitutional questions. It is divisive because in many cases it is
also about life and death. 
  <P>  The primary goal for supporters of habeas corpus reform is to
limit significantly the ability of prisoners on death row to delay the
imposition of capital punishment by raising frivolous legal claims in
federal courts. The Biden and Brooks bills apply to non-capital cases
as well. The current system allows such prisoners to attack their
convictions by repeatedly filing federal habeas corpus petitions,
requesting federal judges to review their cases after they have lost
all of their direct appeals and their state-level habeas corpus
claims. These filings can result in years of delay, and consume
enormous amounts of the time, energy, and money of the already over-
burdened legal system.
<P>
     Senator Biden deserves credit for initiating negotiations with
prosecutors in crafting his habeas corpus proposal. One result of this
is that representatives of the National District Attorneys Association
and some state attorneys general have expressed support for his bill.
However, a growing number of state prosecutors are expressing
opposition to the language, now that they have fully examined what
their Washington representatives achieved. (California Attorney
General Dan Lungren is leading the drive to defeat the Democrats'
habeas corpus proposal.)
<P>
     The objections to the Biden and Brooks bills are that they not
only fall far short of what is needed to end habeas corpus abuse, but
they also dramatically weaken existing law. The claim is that habeas
corpus abuse would be worse, not better, if these proposals became
law. The bills broaden the legal basis on which habeas claims could be
made, make it easier to file a second, third, or fourth petition than
it is today, and mandate the states to bear large costs in providing
to indigent capital defendants the best defense attorneys available in
all phases of capital litigation.
<P>
     Retroactive Decisions. Under current law, a convicted criminal is
generally unable to challenge his conviction based upon subsequent
changes in the law. "New rules" are not normally retroactive to past
cases. The Supreme Court announced this in the 1989 landmark case of
Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989). ) in which the Court held that a
defendant's claims of constitutional violations in most cases must be
judged in accordance with the law existing at the time his conviction
became final. Without such a principle, the Court explained, appellate
judges would have to be prophets and there would never be finality in
the criminal justice system. All of this means that a prisoner may not
challenge his conviction in a habeas corpus petition on the grounds
that the Supreme Court has established a "new rule" in a particular
area of the law that may be relevant to the prisoner's original case.
<P>
     Reversing Teague through federal legislation, or at least
substantially reducing its effect, has been a top goal of Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill for the past few years. The aim has been to
define by statute "new rule" in a manner that is narrower than the
definition in Teague and later cases. Achieving this change would mean
that many more decisions would be retroactive to past cases, allowing
prisoners new opportunities to overturn their convictions using habeas
petitions.
<P>
     New Grounds for Petition. Since the primary purpose of habeas
corpus reform is to drastically limit the ability of a prisoner to
file a second or successive petition following disposition of the
first, any exception to this "one bite" rule would have to be minor.
President Bush proposed that such petitions be permitted only when
they raised constitutional claims involving new evidence of actual
innocence. But the Clinton approach, embodied in the Biden and Brooks
bills, is very different.
<P>
     New petitions would be permitted under several circumstances.
Among them: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> A retroactive Supreme Court decision which changes the law in
     existence at the time the prisoner's case became final;
<P>
     The emergence of new evidence, such as a relative's affidavit
     asserting an alibi for the petitioner, even if it is unrelated to
     a violation of constitutional rights; and
<P>     The discovery of additional evidence relating to mitigation
     against the sentence of death. (This is a direct repudiation of
     the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Sawyer v. Whitley, (112 S.Ct.
     2514, (1992).) which held that successive habeas petitions may
     not attack a sentence of death on the basis of new mitigating
     factors.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Standards for Defense Counsel. California Attorney General
Daniel Lungren refers to the lengthy provisions involving mandatory
standards for defense lawyers as the "Capital Defense Attorney
Employment Act of 1993." He rightly objects to the new federal
standards being forced on the states even though they are not required
by the Constitution. Moreover, the proposal establishes mandatory
standards on state trials and appeals, not just federal habeas
proceedings, and, in the case of H.R. 3131 and S. 1488, cuts off law
enforcement funding for states that do not "choose" to comply.
<P>
<B> OTHER BIDEN-BROOKS CRIME BILL PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     There are several other problems with H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S.
1607. Two provisions are particularly in need of modification:
<P>
1.   Repeal of the Harmless Error Rules. H.R. 3131 overturns Arizona
     v. Fulminante (111 S.Ct. 1246, (1991).) and possibly other
     "harmless error" cases. In Fulminante, the Supreme Court held
     that a criminal conviction should not be reversed when a
     defendant's invalid confession was admitted into evidence if it
     appears beyond a reasonable doubt that without the confession the
     other evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant. H.R. 3131
     would require convictions in such cases automatically to be
     reversed for new trials.
<P>
2.   Deletion of Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Mandatory minimum
     sentences have become an issue of great controversy. The debate
     usually focuses on the wisdom of mandatory sentences for certain
     types of drug offenders. The Biden and Brooks bills go much
     further by dropping all the proposals for new mandatory sentences
     for serious firearm offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill. For example, the 1992 crime bill contained a ten-year
     mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who used a semi-automatic
     firearm in the course of a violent crime or serious drug
     trafficking offense. H.R. 3131, S. 1488 and S. 1607 do not
     contain this proposal. Instead they simply instruct the
     Sentencing Commission to "provide an appropriate enhancement" for
     this offense. Furthermore, S. 1607 repeals mandatory minimum
     sentences for non-violent drug traffickers. This could
     substantially weaken the ability of federal prosecutors to obtain
     the cooperation of such offenders because they would no longer
     have an incentive to provide valuable information regarding
     trafficking conspiracies.

<P>
<B> REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     The Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House began
working on violent crime bills in the spring of this year, and
introduced their comprehensive plans in early August. Large parts of
the bills (H.R. 2872 and S. 1356) look very much like the proposals
transmitted to Congress by President Bush on two occasions during his
Administration. The strength of these bills is that they contain both
important reforms for the federal system and incentives for system
reforms at the state evel.
<P>
     The provisions in these bills dealing with the federal death
penalty, habeas corpus reform, and the exclusionary rule contain none
of the flaws found in H.R. 3131 and S. 1488. The measures also include
proposals that would have a significant effect on the ability of
federal and state prosecutors to convict criminals committing acts of
sexual violence.
<P>
     A major provision in the Republican bills deals with regional
prisons. The bills propose to spend $3 billion over the next three
years to build and operate large regional prisons. This would be
undertaken in financial partnerships with groups of states. In a
contrast to normal congressional practice, the Republicans also
explain how they would pay for the prisons by identifying specific
spending cuts.
<P>
     These new prisons would be used to house criminal aliens and
certain categories of the most dangerous violent criminals currently
located in state prisons. For a state to be eligible to participate in
this program, it must demonstrate its commitment to combatting violent
crime by reforming its criminal justice system. The key reform is so-
called truth-in-sentencing, which means that violent criminals and
serious drug traffickers must serve at least 85 percent of their
sentences.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION
</B><P>
     The anti-crime plans offered by President Clinton and
congressional Democrats will do nothing to address the wave of violent
crime now plaguing America. At best, these plans offer unfunded
promises to state and local law enforcement. Given the pressing need
for additional resources throughout the criminal justice system, such
empty-handed promises cannot be viewed as acceptable solutions. 
<P>
     Beyond the hollow nature of these proposals lies the damage that
would be done when the criminal justice system is weakened by
provisions overturning Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
enforcement. If Congress were to enact these provisions, it would be a
major setback for crime control. Instead, Congress should adopt
measures that would remove violent criminals from America's streets.

<h3>ON THE FIRING LINE: CLINTON'S CRIME BILL</h3><P>
<b>By David B. Kopel</b><br>
Associate Policy Analyst, Cato Institute<br>
September 24, 1993<br>
<P>

What a thrill to be invited to speak at the Heritage
Foundation. I still remember that December day in 1979 when I saw
a little boxed ad for Policy Review tucked in one of the back pages
of Commentary. I asked my parents to buy me a subscription as a
Christmas present. The magazine had a profound effect on my
thinking, even as I was a Congressional intern for Representative
Pat Schroeder. 
<P>
     President Clinton was elected partly because he sold himself
as a New Democrat who was tough on crime. Almost everyone in
this room considers himself or herself to be tough on crime, as
a former New York prosecutor, I certainly share that viewpoint. So
is there anything that we can find to like in the proposed Clinton
crime bill. While the bill has a few virtues, it is on the whole
dangerous to public safety, both in the short and the long term.
<P>
Prior Restraint on Self-Defense. Let's start with the Brady Bill. Other than professional employees of the gun control lobby and New York City Mayor David Dinkins, I don't know anyone who seriously thinks this proposal is going to have a major impact on crime. I doubt thateven President Clinton expects it to have much of an effect. Accordingly, the fact that the Brady
Bill stands as the centerpiece of the Clinton crime bill is one indication that the bill is more aboutpolitics than about crime control.
<P>
     Here's how the Brady Bill works, in its present draft. When a person wishes to buy a handgun from a gun dealer, the dealer sends a notification to the local police. The local police have the option of conducting a background check of any type on the buyer, but there is no requirement for any background. After five government working days have elapsed, the dealer
may sell the handgun if the police have not vetoed the sale.
<P>
     As a practical matter of course, the dealer won't release the gun until he receives positive authorization from the police, even if the authorization takes months to come through. The risk of tort liability is simply too high. As a result, we can expect to see situations similar to that in New Jersey, where the statutory 30-day waiting period currently lasts for  several months, or New York City, where the statutory 6 month waiting period lasts nearly a year.
<P>
     If, rather than failing to act, the police simply veto the sale, the buyer has no legal recourse. If the sale was vetoed because the buyer was incorrectly mistaken for a person with the same last name who has a criminal record, or the sale was vetoed because the police chief doesn't like racial minorities, or because the police chief doesn't like anybody owning handguns, there is no legal recourse. There is no appeal from the police decision, and lawsuits based on the police decision are specifically forbidden.  In Maryland, where an appeals process exists, the
police are overruled on 78% of appeals.
<P>
     This practice of Handgun Control, Incorporated -- of repeatedly placing such clauses in legislation which appears relatively mild on the surface -- suggests that the group has more on its hidden agenda than moderate controls on handguns. In New Jersey, for example, the ban on so-called assault weapons even outlawed BB guns. 
<P>
     The real point of the Brady Bill is not that it has anything to do with crime control. Rather, it is accurately described by proponents and opponents alike as the first step towards much more restrictive gun controls. In a recent issue of the New York Times, Mrs. Brady explained that she expects the Brady Bill to pave the way for a need-based gun licensing system. By federal law, every transfer of every gun of any type, including the gift of a  old .22 single-shot rifle from father-in-law to son-in-law, would be permitted only if the local police determined that the recipient needed the particular gun. Based on the policies that Handgun Control, Inc. has supported in cities such as Washington and New York, if the police administration decided that nobody needed a gun for protection, or that nobody needed a handgun for any purpose, or that nobody needed a shotgun which could hold more than two shells, the police would have absolute discretion to prohibit the gun transfer.
<P>
     That gun prohibition advocates would support that Brady Bill component of the President's crime bill is not surprising. What is more disturbing is the support that the bill often receives from conservatives. For example, William F. Buckley suggests that the Brady Bill be enacted as a national gesture of our concern about violent crime. But of course one of the reasons
we have so much violent crime is that our political culture has tolerated and our politicians have readily indulged in empty, symbolic gestures, rather than genuine crime control.
<P>
     Some conservatives suggest that the Brady Bill be enacted because the public wants it, or because police lobbyists want it,  as if police or public sentiment could ever justify the infringement of Constitutional rights. And besides, the only polls that show support for the Brady
Bill are those that don't compare the Brady Bill with the NRA alternative. When people  compare the Brady Bill ( a waiting period with no background check) to the NRA alternative (a mandatory computerized check at the point of purchase), the public overwhelmingly prefers the NRA instant check.
<P>
     And to those who say they support the Brady Bill because it can't hurt, let me tell you a story. Armed with a knife, Charles A. Grant, Jr., sexually assaulted a 33-year-old woman on a Virginia beach woman one Tuesday in 1991. The assault was videotaped by a tourist who (not having a permit to carry a concealed handgun for protection), could do nothing to help except record the crime.
<P>
    Wednesday, Charles Grant raped a 12-year-old girl. News broadcasts of the videotape of Grant's Tuesday assault frightened many people in the nearby Nags Head community. 
<P>
     A young woman named Sonya Miller had been wanting a handgun for a while, and on that Wednesday, her father bought her a .38 special revolver. He gave her the revolver that evening.
<P>
     At about 9 p.m., Miss Miller went to the post office to pick up her mail. As she stepped into the dimly lit parking lot near the post office, Charles Grant saw her, and she saw Charles Grant. They both screamed. Grant told the young woman he would not hurt her, but when she attempted to get into her car, Grant lunged at the door. He stuck a .25 caliber pistol in her face, began climbing into the car's back seat, and said I'm going to kill you. 
<P>
     No, she replied, I'm going to kill you. Sonya Miller picked up the revolver she hadacquired less than 15 minutes before. When she pulled the hammer back, he dropped his gun and fled. Miss Miller drove home; her father called the sheriff's office; and Charles Grant was apprehended.
<P>
     Regarding the handgun Miss Miller had just acquired, It's the only thing that saved her life, her father observed. To enact the Brady Bill is to sign the death warrant for the next Sonya Miller. How many innocent people should die so that President Clinton is able to brag that he beat the NRA?
<P>
Federal Death Penalty. How about the rest of the crime bill? Well, President Clinton is probably right that there is some role for a federal death penalty -- especially if adequate funding for defense counsel, and reasonable habeas corpus rules ensure that only guilty people are executed.
But, as Representative John Conyers points out, it is foolish for politicians to posture about how tough on crime they are by listing the number of offenses for which they have created a federal death penalty. Senator Biden's 1992 crime bill found over 50 offenses meriting a federal death penalty, including murder of a federal meat inspector. I would suggest that our streets will not become safer simply because a tough message is sent to those hardened thugs who prey on Department of Agriculture employees.
<P>
     And the moral educational purpose that the death penalty serves -- to highlight the sanctity of human life by emphasizing society's horror at the unjustified taking of an innocent life -- is undermined by the application of the death penalty to any offense other than homicide. Thus, the proposal of Presidential candidate Paul Tsongas, which was echoed in the 1992 Biden
crime bill, to impose the death penalty for possession of large quantities of drugs is morally reprehensible. Assisting another person in engaging in a vice, or in making a foolish medical choice, or in altering their own state of consciousness is not on the same moral plane as homicide. To persons who believe otherwise, consider the possibility that if the mere release of
allegedly pernicious drugs into the stream of commerce becomes a capital offense, how long will it be until corporate officers who, through the chain of command, are already deemed criminally responsible for the release of  actual poisons into rivers and the air, become the next targets for
an omnivorous federal death penalty. The claim that particular water pollution didn't actually kill anyone may be deemed no more an excuse than the claim that a particular crop of hemp never killed anyone.
<P>
     So in proposing a relatively sensible federal death penalty, and resisting the urge for excessive piling on of inappropriate capital offenses, the Clinton crime bill deserves a cheer -- especially if the administration has the gumption to resist a piling on process as the bill moves through Congress.
<P>
A  Standing Army. But no cheers are due for the proposal for federal funding for 50,000 new police officers. First of all, the economy is just beginning to suffer from the largest tax increase in human history in order, supposedly, to reduce the massive federal deficit. This is no time to begin adding even more federal programs.
<P>
     Second, there is no hard evidence that police density makes that much a difference in crime. In 1973, the Kansas City police conducted a year-long experiment. Unbeknownst to the public, all patrol cars and foot patrols were pulled out of one area in the city, and placed in an adjacent, similar area. The police only entered the first area in response to specific calls for
assistance, while the second area enjoyed a doubling of the police presence. And after a year, the crime rate in both areas was unchanged.
<P>
     More fundamentally, federal funding of local police will inevitably bring local police under federal control. Major federal funding of highway construction was commenced with the best of intentions during the Eisenhower presidency, with no strings attached other than highway quality standardization. But in a few decades, the states had grown addicted to federal highway dollars, and those dollars have led to Congressional micromanagement of state drinking ages and of state driver's license revocation policies. Federal funding of education is well on the way to
destroying local control of public and private education. To pretend that federal funding of policing will have any result other than to gradually bring local police forces under the command of a federal police czar is unrealistic.
<P>
     The alternative Republican crime bill is superior to the Clinton proposal in that it pays for new spending by cutting spending elsewhere. But again, spending cuts ought to go to deficit reduction, not new spending. And the Republican alternative runs the same risk of the Clinton bill, of tieing local law enforcement to a federal tether.
<P>
     And the federalization of local police, combined with Vice-President Gore's proposal to consolidate all federal law enforcement under a single command brings us to violation of the spirit, at least, of the Second Amendment.
<P>
     The Second Amendment isn't about duck hunting, nor about shooting lone criminals, although both activities were considered morally laudable.  The Second Amendment at its core is about fear of a criminal federal government in general, and fear of a federal standing army in particular. Uniformed, professional, heavily-armed employees of the central government in Washington -- these were the people that the authors of the Constitution wisely feared would be more loyal to centralized authority than to the communities of America. And it was fear of this mercenary presence which wisely led the authors of our Constitution to believe that law enforcement should be under local control, where the checks and balances of community control would be strongest, and -- unlike the Mongol divisions of the Chinese Red army who massacred the Chinese students at Tienanmen Square -- locally-controlled law enforcement would be less likely to turn its guns on its own community.
<P>
     Thus, the issue on some of the more experimental aspects of the Clinton crime package, such as the national police corps, the community grants to local governments, the use of national service to fund police officers, and the funding of boot camps for first-time offenders, is not whether they will work. The 50 states are fully capable of conducting their own experiments with innovative crime control policies. And such experimentation is likely to be more fruitful when the states are spending their own money. The question for federal funding of these programs is whether they will erode local control, and augment federal control. And why do we need $475
million federal dollars to pay for school security guards? Or to pay for drug education programs? Can't local school boards make their own decisions, with their own tax dollars? And by the way, since the people elected Bill Clinton President, rather than Josef Stalin, isn't it time to do away
with federal funding for  so-called drug education programs that encourage children to turn their parents into the police?
<P>
     Troops to cops sounds like a nice idea -- training retiring military veterans to take police jobs. But do we really want the police to become even more like the military -- to focus on capturing an area and destroying an enemy, to rely heavily on high-tech assaults, with, understandably in a military context, no regard for the rights of persons being attacked, and only scant regard for the safety of bystanders?
<P>
     Already we live in a world were federal agencies feel free to assault on specious charges a peaceful community which happens to have eccentric religious beliefs and a lot of firearms. Already we live in a world where National Guard soldiers point their machine guns at teenage girls, while the United States Army, without probable cause, searches farms for illegal hemp, a product which George Washington grew on his own farm. Will America really be freer and safer by taking more giant steps towards a federal standing army involved in domestic law enforcement?

     <P>
     Let me suggest some elements that ought to have been included in a genuine criminal justice reform bill, reforms that would leave America both safer and freer: 
<P>
Forfeiture reform. Step one, consider Representative Henry Hyde's H.R. 2417, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act. The act protects the fundament right to private property and restores the presumption of innocence through the following measures:
<P>
      Placing the burden of proof on the government. The government would be required to prove guilt, rather than the property owner being required to prove innocence.
<P>
      Providing for the appointment of legal counsel for indigent persons whose property has been seized. The billions of dollars in revenue generated by forfeiture programs provide more than enough resources to pay for counsel.
<P>
      Protecting from forfeiture the property of persons who have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the property would not be used in crime.
<P>
      Eliminating the requirement that persons opposing a forfeiture put up a 10% bond of the property's value. Under current practices, the government takes the property, and then makes the owner put up a bond for the property's value, if she wants to appeal the case while the government retains her property.
<P>
      Extending the time allowed from forfeiture challenges to 60 days after seizure, instead of the current 10 days.
<P>
      Authorizing property owners to sue the government for negligence damage to the property while the property was in government custody; and
<P>
      Allowing the property to be returned to the property owner pending a final resolution of the case, as long as adequate arrangements are made for the security of the property.
<P>
     Indeed, the Hyde forfeiture ought to be followed up with additional forfeiture reforms. A proportionality requirement should be introduced, so that a 10 million dollar piece of property is not subject to forfeiture over a dollar's worth of hemp.  And most importantly, we need to reform the forfeiture laws so that property is only subject to forfeiture if there is an attendant criminal conviction. The requirement for a criminal conviction has been evaded by the legal fiction that a forfeiture proceeding is an action against the property, rather than the owner. Simply put, legal fictions and the administrative convenience of law enforcement agencies should not be allowed to trump our nation's traditional commitment to private property as the foundation of a free society.
<P>
State Authority. Step two, as a beginning towards returning control over criminal justice to the states, reduce the budgets of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement Agency by 80%. Much of what these agencies do has nothing to do with any legitimate federal role in law enforcement. Arresting persons who sell small quantities of drugs or who sell firearms without a license is well within the competence of state and local law enforcement agencies. Federal agencies should focus exclusively on genuinely federal issues, such as the importation or interstate distribution of illegal commodities.
<P>
     Belief in the need to trim the federal role is not confined to libertarians and conservatives who thought that President Reagan's affirmation of the 10th Amendment was the best part of his first inaugural address. The National Sheriffs' Association and the American Correctional
Association ask us to Halt the growing trend towards federalization of state crimes. Federal criminal jurisdiction should not be expanded into areas of traditional state authority unless state, local and federal officials agree that there is a clear and compelling need for an increased federal presence.
<P>
     It is time that we recognized that a one-size-fits all federal approach is not working on most federal programs, including crime control. Mississippi doesn't need to have the same kinds of drug or alcohol laws as does Wisconsin, and Colorado ought to be able to watch the success or failure of the programs in Wisconsin and Mississippi, and then choose its own unique approach. Washington should get out of the business of trying to impose laws drafted in Washington as state statutes, and Washington should get out of the business of enforcing laws which are primarily a state and local concern. Why should Washington, rather than a state legislature, decide what requirements a licensed gun dealer should have? Why should Washington decide what kind of licensing system should be imposed on machine gun owners? Can't New Jersey and Arizona answer these questions differently, and why should Washington take away their 10th amendment right to do so?
<P>
     The 10th Amendment critique of federal criminal justice is not dependent on suspicion of the substance of underlying criminal laws. Carjacking is obviously a heinous crime, and carjackers deserve severe punishment, including the death penalty when the carjacking results in
a felony murder. But what business does Congress have passing a federal carjacking statute? Carjackings are not perpetrated by interstate conspiracies of automobile smugglers. Nor are state and local prosecutors reluctant to prosecute and vigorously punish these thugs. Likewise, turning
rape into a federal offense by redefining it as a civil rights violation improperly insults state and local law enforcement by presuming that existing rape laws are not vigorously enforced.
<P>
     Conservatives who want to use federal funds to push states towards remaking their state criminal justice system in a conservative image, with more mandatory minimums, pre-trial detention, and truth-in-sentencing, might perhaps consider what will happen when the tools of federal coercion begin to be used to require the states, increasingly dependent on federal criminal
justice dollars, to enforce the leftist criminal agenda: Mandatory minimums for paperwork violations of environmental laws. Harsh forfeitures imposed on persons who dare to possess an unregistered shotgun. Re-education program for the politically incorrect whose dissent from the radical feminist and critical race theory agenda is labeled hate speech.
<P>
     In this regard, applause is due to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which a few days ago declared unconstitutional the federal Gun-free School Zones Act. By that 1990 law, it is a federal felony for you to park your car across the street from your house, take your unloaded hunting rifle out of your car trunk, and carry the rifle into your home, if you happen to be within a thousand feet of a school. Certainly state and local government ought to be able to restrict the carrying of weapons onto school property. But again, the restrictions appropriate in New York City are not appropriate for Bozeman, Montana. The federal Court of Appeals recognized as much, by declaring that federal control of this issue was an unreasonable intrusion into a traditional area of state and local control.
<P>
Warrant reform. If we can get the federal government out of regulating areas of state and local concern, such as who can possess firearms components, then we will begin saving lives by reducing the scope of operations of agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The fiasco and mass-murder in Waco highlight the need to prevent the fraudulent procurement of warrants for hypertechnical violations of BATF interpretations of federal gun laws. In this regard, the warrant requirement for gun law violations, and perhaps for other federal crimes as well, should be protected through the following reforms:
<P>
      Require that a warrant application be reviewed by a United States Attorney before being presented to a judge or magistrate. This will allow the Department of Justice to perform its proper function to review the legality of federal agency actions.
<P>
      Allow use of hearsay evidence only if the actual witness is unavailable.
<P>
      Require that probable cause be established for each element of the alleged offense.
<P>
      Establish a reasonable time limit, such as 30 days, between the date of an alleged offense and the date of a search warrant. This will prevent Waco-type situations, where a February 1993 raid was launched for offenses which had allegedly occurred in early 1992.
<P>
      Require that an application for a warrant fully inform the magistrate or judge of contradictory or possibly exculpatory evidence.

   <P>   Establish the presumption that once a warrant is served, the warrant and accompanying application should almost never be sealed from public disclosure, except when necessary to protect the safety of persons identified in the warrant application.
<P>
      Require specific judicial authorization for use of extraordinary use of force in serving a warrant, including no-knock entry. 
<P>
These changes would not impair the ability of responsible law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants, but they would prevent at least some irresponsible and abusive federal actions.
<P>
Mandatory Minimums. Finally, it is time for Congress to consider seriously Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) bill to repeal all federal mandatory minimums, especially regarding non-violent crimes. Nearly 70% of federal prison space is used to house drug offenders, many of them first offenders serving 5, 10 or 20 year mandatory minimums. A free-market economist can tell you why this
policy hasn't created a dent in the supply of illegal drugs. Federal prison space should prioritize the long-term incarceration of violent offenders. Violent convicts should be allocated sufficient prison space to ensure that they stay off the streets until they are too old and lacking in high-
level testosterone to commit further violent crime. Only once the violent criminals are taken off the streets for good should whatever prison space is left over be used for non-violent prisoners.
<P>
     It is notable and commendable that the prison-building programs in the Republican alternative crime bill are focussed on increasing prison space for repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In conclusion, I would urge that the conservatives of the 1990s take heed from some of the failures of the 1960s. The liberals of the 1960s were motivated by legitimate concerns for economic and social justice, as the conservatives and President Clinton are today motivated by genuine concerns over criminal justice. But these laudable concerns should not obscure the
fundamental principle that our federal government is one of limited, enumerated powers, and has no general police power to legislate at large. Many criminal justice programs that can appropriately be proposed by the Governor of Arkansas are not appropriately proposed by the President of the United States. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the practical experience of decades of failed federal efforts to control matters of state and local concern, perhaps suggest that it is time to begin reducing, rather than expanding, the role of the federal government in many areas, including criminal justice.<P>

<h3> CRIME, POVERTY, AND THE FAMILY </h3>
<b>By The Honorable William P. Barr </b>
<P> <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>July 29, 1992.
<P>

            

      I don't have to tell you that things are at a critical juncture
in our country when it comes to violent crime. We find violence now
running at intolerably high levels. The heyday of violent crime was
actually in the 1960s and 1970s, and I will describe it in more detail
later. It peaked in 1980. It started going downward for a few years
and now it is picking back up again. It has since 1986 drifted back up
again, although the victimization rates today are still significantly
lower than they were at its peak in 1980 and 1981. 
<P>
      I think the trend we are seeing in violent crime is driven
basically by three factors. First, the crack epidemic that started in
about 1986 has led to a high degree of violence. Second, we are seeing
the results of some of the family policies of the 1960s and 1970s --
the breakdown of the family -- and we are starting to pay the price
for that with a surge in juvenile crime and the emergence of gangs.
And third, we are seeing the saturation of the criminal justice
systems in the states and the states relapsing to revolving door
justice as prisoners are serving less and less of their sentences and
are being prematurely released. I think those are the main factors in
this upward trend of violence. 
<P>
      Now, in public discourse about how to deal with this violence,
we generally see two competing views. One is the traditional law
enforcement approach, which says crime is caused by criminals and the
way we deal with crime is to use aggressive enforcement policies and
to deter or incapacitate criminals through incarceration. On the other
hand, I think we see a lot said about what I call the social
rehabilitation response to violent crime. That approach tends to see
crime as caused by societal ills and seeks to deal with crime by
remedying these ills through social programs. Proponents of this
approach say that you can't really deal with violent crime by
suppression, you have to attack it at its root causes. 
<P>
      Combined Approach. I think we need both approaches, properly
understood, acting together. We do have to take aggressive steps today
to deal with the criminals of today. But, we also have to take steps
and we do need programs to prevent, as best we can, the youth of today
from becoming the chronic offenders of tomorrow.
<P>
      I think too many advocates of the root causes approach, however,
give short shrift to the need for tough law enforcement. They just
can't bring themselves to deal with criminals decisively and they tend
to dismiss reliance on police and prosecutors and prisons as
unenlightened. Many times I hear it said that we should be spending
money on schools and housing and so forth rather than on police and
prosecutors and prisons. 
<P>
      Well, today I want to make three points. First, I want to
explain why I think a strong law enforcement approach has to be
paramount. Second, I want to discuss what I think we in law
enforcement can do to have an impact. And third, I want to spend a
little time talking about social programs and the root causes approach
to dealing with violent crime and what I think we have to do there.
<P>
      Basic Reality. So, let us turn first to the issue of why law
enforcement must be paramount today. I think those that would give
short shrift to suppression of crime through strong law enforcement
measures, but would instead rely upon dealing with root causes, are
missing a basic point -- the basic reality that we see today -- and
that is, that in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and violence that
we see in the inner cities particularly, even the best designed social
programs cannot take root. The problem is that our efforts to deal
with underlying social maladies are being strangled by crime itself.
And I think it is increasingly clear that suppression of crime is a
prerequisite for any of our social programs to be successful. 
<P>
      What good is it to build a housing project to see it taken over
by drug traffickers and used as a stash house? Or what good is it to
invest as much as we do in education and build model schools, only to
see those schools become battlegrounds for gangs? The Green Housing
Project in Chicago is a project where the federal government has spent
a lot of money and has many innovative programs underway. But the
principal concern of the mothers in that housing project is the safety
of their children. They put their children to sleep in the bathtubs
because of the bullets flying around, starting Thursday night and
running through the weekend. So we have gotten to the age of armored
cribs in the inner city. 
<P>
      I was down at the Prince Garden Apartments Project in Fort
Worth. It had just been swept by the police, and the tenants of those
apartments came out applauding the police. They held a barbecue for
the police, pleading with them not to leave their housing project. One
old lady came out and told me that she had been sleeping on the floor
under her bed for months because of the bullets flying around the
courtyard in the housing project. 
<P>
      Crime Causing Poverty. It was once a shibboleth that poverty
causes crime, but today I think it is clear that crime is causing
poverty. Businesses are driven from crime-ridden neighborhoods, taking
jobs and opportunities with them. Potential investors and would-be
employers are scared away. Existing owners are deterred from making
improvements on their property, and as property values go down, owners
disinvest in their property. I know a small contractor who tried to
rehabilitate inner-city housing for low-income tenants. He had to give
up because drug addicts would break in, rip out his improvements, and
sell them for drug money. They would even come in regularly and take
out all of the piping in the building and sell it for scrap. This
contractor obviously couldn't continue like that, and like many others
has just stopped his efforts to rehabilitate housing. 
<P>
      I think that what we saw in Los Angeles shows the difficulty we
are going to have in rebuilding those communities. It shows the impact
of crime on a community in fast motion, fast forward. But that same
process is occurring around the country at a more deliberate speed.
<P>
      So in short, I don't think you can have progress amid chaos. And
the fact is that no urban program can arrest the decline in our inner
cities, and no anti-poverty programs are going to take hold unless
they are combined with and founded upon strong law enforcement
measures that suppress violent crime.
<P>
      That brings me to my second point, which I am going to dwell on
at length: What do we do on the law enforcement side to suppress
violent crime? How do we actually make reductions in violent crime? In
my view, the evidence is absolutely clear that the vast bulk of
violent crime is committed by a very small group of chronic offenders.
Study after study shows that this tiny fraction of incorrigible,
habitual offenders is responsible for hundreds and hundreds of crimes
each while they are out on the street. A well known study in 1980,
which followed 240 criminals, found that in an eleven-year period they
committed over 500,000 crimes -- an average of 190 crimes a year. And
that corresponds to numerous other studies that show that kind of
criminality. Another study of various state prisoners found that 25
percent of them committed 135 crimes a year; 10 percent of them
committed 600 crimes a year. Every study shows a tiny cohort is
responsible disproportionately for the vast amount of predatory
violence.
<P>
      We know the profile of these criminals. They start committing
crimes as juveniles. They go right on committing crimes. They commit
crimes as adults; they commit crimes when they are on parole,
probation, or bail. With this type of habitual offender, the only time
they are not committing crimes, at least prior to their fortieth
birthday, is when they are in prison. 
<P>
      Today's Conflagration. And I think that in combatting violent
crime, we in the criminal justice system must make it our primary goal
to identify, to target, and to incarcerate this hard core element of
chronic offenders. They should be incapacitated in custody for the
time dictated by the public's safety, and not by other artificial
restraints like prison space. I think this is the only approach in law
enforcement that has any prospect for reducing levels of violent
crime. No matter how well we tinker with and perfect our social
rehabilitation programs, they are not going to take hold for decades
and decades. We have crime on the streets right now. We have to put
out the fire today. Yes, we can redesign houses so they are more
fireproof in the future, but right now we have a conflagration and we
have to deal with it. 
<P>
      I think the history of the last thirty years shows that this
policy of incarceration works. The 1960s and 1970s, as you know, were
the era of permissiveness in law enforcement. Fewer people were locked
up. The people we put away did not serve long sentences. The
incarceration rates dropped. At the end of the 1960s we had fewer
people in prison than we did when the decade started. In the 1980s, we
started turning things around. We built prisons at the federal level
and the state level. We toughened up our criminal justice system. We
started putting tougher federal judges on the bench. And during the
1980s we turned around the incarceration rates. We started out with
300,000 prisoners in state prisons at the beginning of the decade and
we ended it with 800,000. The spiraling violent crime rate of the
1960s and 1970s came to an abrupt halt and plateaued out. But now it
is going up again.
<P>
      I think if we are going to reduce violent crime we have to
finish the job we began in the 1980s and get those violent offenders
off the street. Unfortunately, I think a lot of states are relapsing
back to the 1960s and 1970s-style revolving door system. Today,
prisoners on the average are serving only 37 percent of their
sentences. In some states, like Texas, they say it is 22 days for
every one year of sentence. In Florida, it is 18 percent of sentence
served. That is because of prison capacity. Prisoners are being
recycled back out onto the streets, after a very short period of time
in prison, simply to make room for the next wave. The average sentence
given for rape in this country, for example, is eight years; the
average sentence served is three years. Three years is the average
price of a rape. In many larger states, it is much lower than that. At
least 30 percent of the murders in this country are committed by
people who are on probation, parole, or bail at the time of murder.
So, 6,500 of our fellow citizens are slaughtered each year by people
who have been caught and then prematurely released back onto the
streets.
<P>
      I think stopping the revolving door is going to require three
things. It is going to require more resources at both the federal and
state level. It is going to require legal reform at both the federal
and state level. And it is going to require an unprecedented degree of
cooperation -- the federal government, the state government, local
enforcement working together to target the hardest core offenders so
we get the most bang for the bucks. 
<P>
      The President has put substantial resources both into the
federal effort and into state law enforcement, substantially
increasing assistance to the states -- notwithstanding some erroneous
information handed out last week by political opponents -- and
substantially increasing the Justice Department budget over 60 percent
in three years. And he has done this against the Congress that has
been cutting back on his law enforcement requests. I think we are
going to have to see the states also make that kind of commitment. My
own view is that we are not spending enough on state and local law
enforcement. 
<P>
      We have to get back to basics during times of tight budgets and
spend money on things that count. We have to recall that protecting
the public security is the first duty of government. That is why we
submit ourselves to government in the first place, because of the
security. The government has an obligation to perform that function,
and right now they are not putting in the kind of investment that is
needed.
<P>
      Astronomical Costs. In fact, we are being penny wise and pound
foolish, because the cost of not investing in law enforcement is much
higher than the cost of investing. The cost of crime -- just the
economic cost -- is $92 billion a year. That doesn't count lives lost.
It is lost to the criminal justice system in revolving doors -- we
just keep on spending our resources, spinning our wheels, essentially.
There is the cost of private security. We spend astronomical amounts
of money in private security in this country. We don't put the bars up
around the prisoners, people who deserve to be behind bars, and
private citizens pay to put bars up between themselves and prisoners,
and they become the prisoners. And that is exactly what is happening.
And there are a lot of other economic costs -- lost sales, lost
revenues, and so forth.
<P>
      When you total it all up, it is clear that the cost of spending
on an effective criminal justice system is far lower. There is one ATF
study that crystallizes this. It costs an average of $25,000 a year to
keep someone in a prison cell. The ATF study of chronic firearms
offenders in the federal system came up with the figure of over
$300,000 for each year those people were out on the street and the
crimes they committed. So, I think that law enforcement is an
investment well worth making in these tight budget times.
<P>
      On the reform level, you are all aware that we accomplished a
lot in the 1980s. We abolished parole at the federal level and gave
strong minimum sentences and so forth. We had an unfinished agenda --
the death penalty, habeas corpus reform, expansion of the good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule -- and those were in the federal
crime bill that the President is pushing. But 95 percent of violent
crime is at the state level. That, I think is where the real battle
is. Unless we reform the state systems in the 1990s, as we did with
the federal system in the 1980s, we are not going to make much
progress in dealing with violent crime.
<P>
      And so, reform is critical. Yesterday we issued a report with 24
specific recommendations on how state criminal justice systems can be
improved. That report has wide backing in the law enforcement
community and among victims' groups. I am optimistic that is going to
be helpful to groups that are seeking improvement in the criminal
justice systems in their states.
<P>
      Targeting Chronic Offenders. I mentioned corporation and
targeting our resources on the most hard-core offenders. We have an
aggressive program in several areas where we are trying to do that.
For example, the program that I just released our first report on
today -- our first annual report -- is a trickle off program where we
work with a combination of state and local enforcement to use tough
firearms laws to take out chronic offenders. By giving them tough
federal penalties without probation or parole we keep them off the
streets. Over the past year, for example, we have prosecuted over
6,400 individuals; we are achieving an over 90 percent conviction
rate. The average sentence without parole is seven years for these
firearms offenders -- I am talking about felons who use firearms.
Three-time losers, people with three prior offenses, are averaging
eighteen years without parole in the federal system. These are the
worst of the worst -- chronic offenders with extensive criminal
history records who are caught in possession of a firearm.
<P>
      That is just one example of targeting our resources to the
chronic offender. We have similar programs underway against gangs
across the country, and I think in the months ahead you will start to
see more gangs being taken down in Philadelphia. In our pilot project
and violent traffickers program, which we did in conjunction with the
Philadelphia police department, a three-year program, we destroyed 38
gangs, 600 gang members. The leaders of those gangs are serving time
in federal penitentiaries right now without parole or probation. We
also have similar operations going on with respect to chronic offender
fugitives and with respect to criminal aliens. 
<P>
      Root Causes. What this all means is, if we put in sufficient
resources and target our efforts at incapacitating prime offenders, if
we put in more resources and we accomplish needed reform, and if we
work together in joint programs that target our limited resources at
the hardest core element, then I think we can have an impact on
violent crime. I think we can provide a foundation upon which our
efforts at social rehabilitation can be successful. 
<P>
      And that brings me to my third and final point. As I said at the
outset, I think strong law enforcement ultimately should be combined
with economic and social and moral rehabilitation of our communities,
particularly in our inner-city neighborhoods. How do you go about the
task of revitalizing them? What are the root causes of crime and what
do you have to do to address them? What kind of social programs should
we be pursuing? Now there are some who say that what we need is
another massive round of spending on social welfare programs. And I
think that is a mistaken view. We have poured trillions of dollars
into social welfare programs over the last 25 years. The root-cause
strategy is not something new. The root-cause strategy is precisely
what we have been pursuing for 25 years.
<P>
      Today, the government is spending, just on means-tested anti-
poverty programs, record amounts -- $280 billion a year. This is up
from $9.6 billion in 1965 at the start of the Great Society. It is up
from $106 billion in 1980 and it has gone up significantly in real
terms during President Bush's Administration. A record 4.77 percent of
GDP now goes into means-tested programs. And that comes down to $3,111
for every taxpayer -- $3,111 goes into anti-poverty spending. That
doesn't take into account non-means tested root-cause programs. And
what have we gotten for this investment? I think that any fair-minded
observer would have to say that the overall results of this 25-year
war on poverty have been disappointing. Certainly the track record of
these programs in fighting poverty has been less than impressive.
<P>
      Now frankly, I think the argument that poverty causes crime is
too much overstated. I think poverty is probably a contributing factor
toward crime. But standing alone, the correlation between poverty as a
causal factor in crime is very weak. In 1950, for example, the poverty
rate was about 32 percent; today, it is 13.5 percent. And yet in 1950
crime rates were much lower than they are today. And in the Great
Depression, when about half of this nation's population lived below
the poverty line, as today defined, crime was more lower than it is
today. When you look at our cities on a grid basis, neighborhood by
neighborhood, the fact is that some of our poorest neighborhoods have
relatively low crime rates.
<P>
      But even accepting poverty as a contributing factor to crime,
the fact is that, despite our massive spending programs, hard-core
poverty seems as stubborn as ever. The fact of the matter is, more
progress was made on reducing poverty levels in the seven years
preceding the Great Society than has been made since the Great
Society. And most of the progress in reducing poverty levels was made
in the years immediately following 1965 and during the early years of
the Reagan revolution. Otherwise, results have been very
disappointing. There seems to be a persistent class of about 10-15
million Americans for whom poverty and dependency is long term and
even inter-generational. Our anti-poverty programs have made virtually
no headway against this hard-core group.
<P>
      But more significantly, the policies of the past 25 years have
contributed directly to the breakdown of the family, particularly in
the inner cities. Now, before the Los Angeles riots I said on the
David Brinkley show that we were witnessing in inner-city crime the
grim harvest of the Great Society. Senator Moynihan said that this was
the most depraved statement he had ever heard from anybody. I stand by
what I said. 
<P>
      The welfare policies we have been pursuing since 1965 contain
perverse incentives that have contributed to the breakdown of the
family by rewarding and promoting non-marriage and illegitimacy. The
numbers are truly staggering. The illegitimacy rate started to
escalate rapidly after 1965. In 1965, 7.7 percent of American children
were born to unwed mothers. Today the rate is 27 percent. For black
children it has climbed to 65 percent, and in many inner-city areas it
is over 80 percent. And this has been compounded by the skyrocketing
divorce rates in our society. The number of divorces per year has
tripled since 1960.
<P>
      Disintegration of the Family. This family breakdown is a social
and a moral catastrophe and is at the root of so many of the problems
that beset out nation. In my view, the root cause of both crime and
poverty is precisely this unraveling of the family. I think the
evidence is clear that children from single-parent homes use drugs
more heavily and commit more crimes throughout their lives than
children from two-parent homes. Studies show that most gang members
come from single-parent homes. Some 70 percent of juvenile delinquents
in state reform institutions lived in single-parent homes or with
someone other than their natural parents. One study found that 75
percent of adolescent murderers came from single-parent homes. Recent
research by June O'Neill, formerly of the Urban Institute, finds that
a black child in a single-parent home is more than twice as likely to
engage in criminal activities as a black child from a two-parent home.
Moreover, when that child is in a neighborhood where there are many
other single-parent families, the child becomes three times more
likely to engage in criminal activity. A 1988 study published in the
Journal of Research on Crime and Delinquencies found that the rates of
violent crime in a community correlated directly with the proportion
of single-parent households in the community, but not the poverty or
racial composition apart from family structure. In other words, they
found that neither poverty nor race were significantly correlated to
crime when family structure is taken into account.
<P>
      Moreover, the disintegration of the family is the basic cause of
long-term poverty and dependency in America today. Almost 70 percent
of single-parent families with children and 80 percent of never-
married mothers receive some form of government assistance. The
poverty rate for female-headed households with children is at 44.5
percent, compared to 7.8 percent for married couples with children.
Single-parent families account for 65 percent of poor families with
children, and over half of all poor families. Studies show that it is
primarily this group among the poor who remain mired in poverty and
dependency over the long term.
<P>
      So, that is the track record of the policies that we have been
pursuing for 25 years -- little headway against hard-core poverty and
the contribution to the breakdown of the family, which in turn, spawns
crime and further poverty. The idea that if we just increase our
record spending levels by a few more tens of billions of dollars we
will somehow achieve a breakthrough is, in my view, incredible.
<P>
      Reform Agenda. The solution is not in the scale of the programs
we have been pursuing, it is in their structure. We have to be a lot
smarter about the kinds of growth that we pursue. And in this regard,
from the very beginning of the Administration, this President has been
pursuing a reform agenda -- a set of new ideas, not business as usual,
not pouring money into these discredited programs. His efforts seem to
avoid the mistakes of the past. So rather than blindly following those
programs that foster dependency and contain incentives that reward
non-work and non-marriage and illegitimacy, the President has proposed
programs that promote bottom-up growth and give real opportunity. And
that is why he is proposing enterprise zones to bring jobs and
investment into the inner cities and why he is proposing to give
public housing residents the opportunity to purchase their homes. That
is why he has been urging welfare reform to turn around the current
system that rewards non-marriage and illegitimacy and to promote
stable family life. Strong families in the long run will be more
effective than big bureaucracies in revitalizing our inner-city
communities. And he has been seeking to empower grass roots
institutions, not bureaucracies. I think the best hope for genuine
community renewal lies in fostering the rebirth of those traditional
institutions which emerge from the communities themselves and are the
best institutions for the moral formation of children -- the family
and the church and community groups. 
<P>
      Today many of the social experts who brought us the 1960s and
1970s, and are largely responsible for the fix we are in, are
promoting a further set of half-baked solutions to our problems that,
I think, send the wrong moral message and are equally
counterproductive -- like handing out needles to addicts and condoms
to the kids in high school, and even below high school level. 
<P>
      Sending the Right Message. Our social programs, I think, have to
send the right message if we want to turn around behavior. Now law
enforcement sends a clear message about right and wrong, about
personal responsibility, and about what a just society expects of its
citizens. Our social programs must reinforce that message.
<P>
      So, my message today really is threefold. First, social programs
can't be pursued at the expense of, or in lieu of, tough law
enforcement policies. On the contrary, law enforcement is the
foundation upon which all else must be built and is an absolute
prerequisite for social programs to be successful.
<P>
      Second, the only way to reduce violent crime is to target and
incapacitate chronic violent offenders through the tough policy of
incarceration. While this Administration has acted vigorously at the
federal level to help states deal with violent crime, the long-term
solution is for the states to toughen up their own criminal justice
systems and make adequate investments in them.
<P>
      And third, pouring money into a new round of social welfare
programs is not the answer. Instead, we have to be smarter about the
way we pursue social welfare programs. We need programs that foster
opportunity and not dependency, strengthen not undermine the family,
and that sends the right not the wrong message. 
<P>
      These are difficult problems that grew up over decades. And now
the people who helped contribute to the problems are holding stop
watches on the solutions. The problems will not be solved overnight;
it is going to be a long-run proposition. But I think that if we
follow this agenda -- the President's agenda -- then we can make a
real impact and make this a safer and more just society.<P>

<h3>
FIGHTING CRIME: ASSESSING  THE BUSH  AND  BIDEN APPROACHES </h3>

By Andrew J.  Cowin<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

Issues Bulletin No. 164<br>
June 10, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

 Congress is considering two major anti-crime packages.  One
package, sponsored by the Bush Administration, was introduced in
the Senate by Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican, as
S.635 and in the House as H.R.  1400 by GOP Leader Robert Michel
of Illinois.  The second package consists of two bills, S.15 and S.618,
introduced in the Senate by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat
who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
    <P>  Of the two, the Bush package is better -- mainly because it is
realistic about what the federal government can do about street crime
all across America.  The Biden package, by contrast, while containing
some promising proposals, increases federal intrusion into local law
enforcement.  All this will do is spend huge sums of money and
expand the federal bureaucracy, while actually making it more
difficult for local police and prosecutors to capture and convict
criminals.
<P>
       Until recent decades, crimes such as murder, assault and
robbery, and most of what are known as street crimes, were dealt
with by the states and localities in which they occurred, under state
and local laws.  Consistently and wisely the United States has rejected
the need for a national police force to deal with such matters. 
Instead, the federal government has focused mainly on interstate
crimes, on keeping national crime statistics and on helping local law
enforcement officials keep up with the latest crime prevention
techniques.  Not until the late 1960s did the federal government
become deeply involved in local crime issues.  Since then, billions of
federal dollars have been spent on the war on crime -- with no
noticeable success.  In fact, violent street crime in America has grown
worse, rising by 10 percent last year alone. (Washington Post, April
29, 1991, A6.)
<P>
          The Bush anti-crime package recognizes that crime is
best fought locally.  The package thus mainly offers needed
amendments to federal criminal law.  It improves, for example, the
habeas corpus procedure by curtailing the number of times that a
convicted criminal can appeal to federal courts after full and fair
state criminal proceedings have been completed.  The Bush package
also reforms the exclusionary rule, which currently excludes relevant
evidence in criminal trials.  As important, the package does not
significantly increase federal intrusion into local law enforcement
efforts or simply throw more money at the crime problem.
<P>
          The Bush package thus makes a useful contribution to
America's fight against crime.  It is also an appropriate contribution
because it is limited, implicitly recognizing that the kind of crime that
mainly affects Americans is the kind of crime that mainly has to be
fought locally. 
<P>
           Ironically, George Bush does not seem to realize just
how appropriate his crime package is.  His State of the Union speech
this January, for example, and subsequent statements by him and his
Justice Department, talk about the package as if it were a
comprehensive, major federal anti-crime effort.  It is not.  And it is
not what America needs.  The White House would serve the nation
well by bringing presidential rhetoric into line with the President's
crime proposal.  So doing, it would remind Americans that states and
localities in the past, when unhampered by federal red tape, by and
large kept America's streets safe.
<P>
          In contrast to the Bush package, the Biden anti-crime
bills would accomplish very little, and actually would create yet new
obstacles to local attempts to deal with crime.  While the Bush crime
package would cost no new money, Biden wants to spend $4 billion
extra annually.  His bills would erect new mountains of red tape by
requiring the Executive Branch to submit ten new annual reports to
Congress.  The Biden package would intrude the federal government
further into local crime prevention efforts and would make local
criminal justice systems less responsive to the needs and concerns of
their citizens.  Biden, for instance, would inject the FBI into such
family disputes as wife-beating.  And it would establish what in
essence would be a racial quota system for the death penalty.
<P>
          The Biden package thus would take America further in
the direction towards having a national police force and this then
further would blur the roles of the federal and state governments in
crime prevention.
<P>
          Americans face two distinct views on the crime
problem.  One, offered by Bush, focuses on the concept that laws
must be reformed to ensure that the guilty go to jail.  The other,
offered by Biden, holds that America must spend much more federal
money fighting crime and increase the police power of the national
government.  The Bush vision is clearly preferable.
<P>
<B> STATE VERSUS FEDERAL ROLES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE </B>
<P>
     Until the late 1960s, America's states and localities had
virtually exclusive responsibility for fighting violent street crime.  The
reasons for this are clear.  Criminals are arrested by local police. 
They are indicted under state and local laws.  They are tried in state
or county courts.  And they are sentenced to serve time in state or
county prisons. 
<P>
           The federal government traditionally has concerned
itself only with interstate crimes or crimes involving international
activities and to provide certain assistance for local law enforcement
officials.  These activities have included:
Fighting foreign drug cartels and organized crime groups like the
Mafia. 
<P>
 Compiling and disseminating research, statistics and other
information such as the number of crimes committed in each
jurisdiction in America; 
<P>
Providing information and limited training to local law enforcement
officials in advanced crime fighting techniques.
<P>
Collecting and maintaining a nationwide file of criminal records and
fingerprints. 
<P>
 Researching and developing scientific and technological advances
such as improved uses of "genetic fingerprinting" to identify suspects. 
  <P>    Not until Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Omnibus Crime and Safe
Streets Act did the federal government significantly intervene in local
crime.  This Act had broad support in Washington and among big-city
mayors and police chiefs.  After the Act was passed, the mayors,
predictably alert for revenue sources other than from their own
taxpayers, continued to pressure Congress for more anti-crime aid. 
Through subsequent amendments to the Act, Congress vastly
increased the amount of federal money devoted to local crime
problems.
<P>
          In addition to money, Congress also has approved using
federal manpower to fight local crime.  Example:  the 1988 Omnibus
Anti-Drug Act made possession of any amount of an illegal drug a
federal crime.  The result:  Thousands of street level drug-dealers
have been arrested by federal agents. 
<P>
           Despite this increased federal assistance, violent crime
rates jumped throughout the 1970s.  They did so also in the 1980s,
although at a slower rate than before.  Thus, federal intervention in
local crime has had little discernible impact aside from confusing the
issue over ultimate responsibility for attacking the problem.
<P>

<B> THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Bush Administration has drafted and supports legislation
that closes loopholes in the federal system.  It does not attempt the
kind of grand crime-fighting strategy that likely would make matters
worse.  Many of the changes will affect only federal criminal
procedures and thus will have little impact on street crime. 
<P>
           Measures in the Bush package include:

<P>Reform of Habeas Corpus.  
<P>
          The Bush bill would reform the habeas corpus system. 
Habeas corpus generally refers to the right of individuals, guaranteed
by Article I, Section 9 of the U.S.  Constitution, not to be detained
without being charged with a crime.  The Bush bill does not deal with
this constitutional aspect of the right, but instead with what experts
call the statutory right of habeas corpus, enacted in 1867 and
expanded since by federal judges. 
<P>
           The statutory habeas corpus allows state prisoners to
petition federal courts for a review of their cases after they have
exhausted state remedies.  Lawyers for death row inmates in
particular have made substantial use of this as a device to postpone
executions.  Other inmates have inundated federal courts with pleas
to overturn sentences; typically these inmates argue that, at their
trials, they lacked effective counsel or that their trial procedurally was
flawed. 
<P>
           With few exceptions, these petitions raise frivolous
issues and are dismissed in federal court -- but only after they
consume enormous amounts of court time.  Last year alone, some
11,000 habeas corpus petitions were made by state prisoners to
federal courts.  Declares former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
"I know of no other system of justice structured in a way that assures
no end to the litigation of a criminal conviction.  [This] system is
viewed with disbelief by lawyers and judges in other countries."
(Report to the Attorney General, Federal Habeas Corpus Review of
State Judgments, p.  viii, (1987).)
<P>
     The Bush package would help reduce this tidal wave of
petitions by setting, in most cases, a time limit for federal habeas
corpus application of one year after the state prisoner exhausted his
or her state remedies.  The bill, in addition, would require federal
judges whenever possible to uphold state court decisions.  This
provision also would apply to petitions involving most death penalty
cases. 

     
<P>
     

<P>Reform of the exclusionary rule.
<P>
          The "exclusionary rule" is so named by legal scholars
because it allows judges to "exclude" from the court's proceedings
relevant evidence found through what have been claimed to be illegal
searches.  Excluding such evidence often allows guilty defendants to
go free.
<P>
          The basis for the exclusionary rule is the Fourth
Amendment which states that 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The right of people to be secure in their persons,
     houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable
     searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no
     warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
     by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
     place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
     seized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          The Fourth Amendment says nothing explicitly about
excluding evidence.  But, the Supreme Court stated in its 1914 Weeks
v.  United States ruling that courts would be sanctioning violations of
the Fourth Amendment if the material gathered through illegal
searches could be admitted into evidence. (Weeks v.  United States,
232 U.S.  383 (1914).)  This ruling was extended to criminal
proceedings at the state and local level by Mapp v.  Ohio in 1961. 
Over the years, this and other court decisions have allowed many
criminals to go free merely if the police commit even a minor blunder
in collecting crucial evidence.
     <P>     The Supreme Court in 1984 rectified part of this
problem in United States v.  Leon, by creating a "good faith"
exception for searches of private buildings pursuant to a warrant.
(United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S.  897 (1984).)  This means that if a
police offficer has good reasons to believe a search warrant is valid,
evidence gathered pursuant to that warrant must be admitted in
court, even if a judge later decides that the warrant was mistakenly
issued.  The Bush  bill would extend this good faith exception to all
circumstances, such as a car search made without a warrant.  The
number of cases affected, however, will be small; some estimates are
as low as 1.5 percent.  Still it will rid the court system of a loophole
that frustrates the police and creates confusion within the criminal
justice system.  More important, prosecutors will be able to coax
defendants into more stringent plea bargains because defendants will
have less hope of excluding important evidence.
<P>
          Most street criminals, however, are prosecuted in state
courts.  That will diminish the impact of Bush's exclusionary rule
reform because it is the judges on state courts, at least as much as
federal judges, who have been reluctant to recognize a good faith
exception.  They base their reluctance not on the U.S.  Constitution
but on the various state constitutions. 

<P>Expansion of the federal death penalty.  
<P>
          The federal death penalty now can be imposed for
espionage, treason, and murder involving certain federal crimes.  The
Supreme Court has ruled however that for the death penalty to be
enforced, aggravating and mitigating factors in a crime, spelled out in
statutory laws, must be taken into account.  Aggravating factors would
include committing the offense in an especially heinous, depraved and
cruel manner.  Mitigating factors can involve good conduct in jail or
seriously diminished mental capacity. ( See generally, Skipper v. 
South Carolina, 476 U.S.  1 (1986); Lockett v.  Ohio, 438 U.S.  586
(1978);  Barclay v.  Florida, 463 U.S.  939 (1983); Zant v.  Stephens,
462 U.S.  862 (1983).) 
<P>
           The Bush bill would codify a set of mitigating and
aggravating factors, provide for a special hearing to determine
whether a sentence of death is justified, and establish an appeals
process.  This meets Supreme Court standards, and would make the
death penalty enforceable.  Bush also would make 30 currently non-
capital federal crimes subject to the death penalty.  These include
kidnapping where a death results, murder during a hostage taking and
terrorist murders of American nationals abroad.

<P>The "Brady Bill."  
<P>
          The so-called "Brady Bill" refers to H.R.7, introduced by
Representative Edward Feighan, the Ohio Democrat, and recently
passed by the House, and is named after Ronald Reagan's former
press secretary James Brady who was wounded in the 1981 attempt
on the President's life.  This bill would require a seven-day waiting
period on handgun purchases.  During this period, gun sellers would
give the prospective buyer's name to the police, who would have the
option of checking to determine, among other things, if the buyer had
a criminal record, a record of mental illness, a history of drug
addiction, or dishonorable discharge from the armed services. 
Although not originally part of his anti-crime plan, Bush has indicated
that he will sign the Brady Bill if it is included in the broader
legislation.  Despite what appears to be the Brady Bill's broad
emotional appeal to Americans, it is doubtful whether it would have
any significant impact.  Some 17 states already have similar or even
more stringent laws and these have not reduced crimes committed
with guns. 
<P>
          Other provisions of the Bush package would: 

<P>Increase the penalties for firearms violations.  
<P>
     The package would increase from five to ten years the
mandatory federal penalty for using a semi-automatic firearm during
a violent felony; provide a mandatory five-year penalty for possession
of a firearm by individuals previously convicted of a violent felony or
serious drug offense; and, prohibit gun magazines that allow firing
over 15 rounds without reloading.

      

<P>Track youth gangs and other juvenile offenders better.  
<P>
     The Bush package would require the FBI to retain fingerprints
and photographs of juveniles convicted of serious federal crimes. 
Currently it does not keep these records.  The package also would
allow juvenile offenders to be prosecuted as adults for certain crimes. 
And it would count serious drug offenses by juveniles as part of their
adult criminal record, making it easier to define them as "career
criminals" under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

<P>Clarify and expand anti-terrorism laws, including
making terrorism an offense under the Racketeer and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) which was originally intended to combat
organized crime.

<P>Make it easier to prosecute sexual assault and child
abuse cases, and stiffen penalties for repeat offenders.  
<P>
     The Bush package would broaden the Federal Rules of
Evidence to allow courts to consider prior sexual and child abuse
offenses by the defendant.  Inasmuch as states usually adopt changes
made in the Federal Rules, this change is likely to be far-reaching.

<P>Provide for drug testing in the criminal justice
system.  
<P>
     Federal convicts placed on parole, probation or post-
imprisonment supervised release would have to submit to drug tests. 
If they are found to be using illegal drugs, they will be jailed.  The
Bush package would also affect state criminal justice systems,
requiring them to institute a vaguely defined drug testing program.
<P>

<B> EVALUATING THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The most significant parts of the Bush package -- habeas
corpus and exclusionary rule reforms -- are long overdue.  Such
changes would send an important message:  Americans are fed up
with a justice system that shows too much concern for criminals and
not enough for law-abiding citizens.  This is a message that state
legislatures surely will find hard to ignore.  If similarly tough
measures are enacted by states and localities, street crime very likely
would start dropping.
<P>
          The Brady Bill, by contrast, does little but divert
attention from the most serious crime issue:  America's dysfunctional
criminal justice system.  From the founding of the U.S.  until the mid-
1960s, guns were readily available, yet murder rates remained
minuscule compared to those of today.  What changed from the mid-
1960s onward was not the availability of handguns, but the nature of
the criminal justice system.  It stopped working efficiently. 
<P>
           Most of the Bush package is sound, focusing on federal
criminal matters without further interfering with state and local crime
prevention efforts.  Bush could have made an even greater
contribution to fighting crime, however, if he had told the American
people that the best place to fight crime is at the state and local level. 
Instead, he has left the misleading impression that his crime package
will seriously attack the problem, thus giving credence to the idea that
Washington can solve the crime problem, an idea belied by the
specific provisions of Bush's own package.
<P>

<B> THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     One of Biden's bills, S.15, ostensibly seeks to combat violence
against women, while Biden's omnibus bill, S.618, covers some of the
issues in the Bush bill.  Biden would expand the number of crimes
eligible for the death penalty and increase federal penalties for gun-
related crimes.  Measures in the Biden package include: 

<P>Money for Drug Prisons. 
<P>
          Biden proposes $600 million to build, and $100 million
to operate, a new system of regional federal prisons capable of
holding 12,000 prisoners.  The regional prisons would accept from
state systems violent offenders with drug abuse histories and less than
two years left on their sentences.  At the regional facilities, the
prisoners would receive drug treatment.  States would reimburse the
federal government for 100 percent of the cost of those prisoners who
fail to complete the drug treatment program, and 75 percent for those
who do complete it. 

<P>An ROTC for Police.
<P>
          The U.S.  military offers Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) on many college campuses, paying part of the college
tuition of students who promise to devote a certain number of years
to the military after graduation.  Biden proposes $430 million
annually in federal funds to create and finance an ROTC-type
program for police officers.  The Police Corps Program, as it is to be
called, would offer scholarships to college students who agree to work
in a state or local police force for four years after graduation.  The
federal government would pay for education only.  States and
localities would guarantee police positions for graduates and pay
salaries.

<P>Boot Camps.
<P>
          The Biden package would establish 10 federal military-
style boot camp prisons, each to accommodate between 200 and 300
young first offenders and drug abusers.  The theory is that boot
camps, with their tough discipline and absence of career criminals,
could prevent young people from become repeat offenders. ( See,
Billie S.  Erwin and Lawrence A.  Bennett, "New Dimensions in
Probation:  Georgia's Intensive Probation Supervision," National
Institute of Justice, 1987.) 

<P>Violence Against Women Act.
<P>
          To reduce violence against women, despite statistics
that confirm that men are far more likely than women to be the
victims of violence, Biden has introduced The Safe Homes for
Women Act.  It states that, "Any person who travels or causes
another...  to travel across state lines or in interstate commerce with
the intent to injure an intimate partner" and who does injure that
person can be jailed for up to 20 years. ( S.  15, section 211.) 
<P>
           This bill's price tag is almost $560 million a year, spent
mainly on grants to states, Indian tribes, cities, and other localities "to
develop effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to
combat violence against women."  This includes training police and
prosecutors to identify crimes against women, such as sexual assault
and domestic violence; and developing training and expanding units
in police departments and prosecutors' offices that specifically target
violent crimes against women.  Up to $100 million each year would
be spent in areas of "high intensity crime" against women.  Another
$190 million a year would be used for general grants to the states,
and $10 million would be authorized to combat crime against women
in the Indian tribes. 
<P>
           The bill explicitly makes wife-beating a federal crime
for any person who travels across state lines and "does an act that
injures his or her spouse or intimate partner."  Biden thus implies that
the FBI should become involved in what hitherto has been a matter
for local police.  When added to laws that already involve the federal
government in local law enforcement, such as those laws aimed at
arresting street drug dealers, this continues the trend of replacing the
local cop with federal law enforcement officers. 
<P>
           Among other provisions of the Biden package:

<P>Establish new task forces and commissions and
require agencies to file ten new reports to Congress.  
<P>
          Among the new reports would be those that 1) would
measure whether banning assault weapons reduces violence and drug
trafficking; 2) would track the progress of the proposed Police Corps
along with a separate, special report which would recommend
whether to expand the program; 3) would review the efficiency of
traditional criminal justice approaches to preventing crime and
violence through findings of the Commission on Crime and Violence,
and the findings of the National Commission on Violent Crime
Against Women, which would evaluate the adequacy of current
efforts to reduce the rate of violent crimes against women; and, 4)
would identify problems of record keeping of criminal complaints
involving domestic violence. 

<P>Amend the U.S.  Sentencing Commission guidelines to
double the federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and increases
them on first-time rapists.  
<P>
<P>Provide money to reduce crime in public parks, mass
transit and national parks.  
<P>
          The bill would authorize up to $35 million for lighting
and surveillance cameras in such places as bus stops, parking lots,
subway stations and recreation areas.  Money may also be spent to
install emergency phone lines, hire additional security personnel, and
for "any other project intended to increase security and safety."  Up to
$10 million would go to states and local public bodies or agencies to
cut crime in public transportation, $15 million to the National Park
System; and $10 million to states for use in public parks.

<P>Create new rules of evidence to make it more
difficult to question in court an alleged victim about her sexual
history. 
<P>
          Under Biden's law, reputation or opinion evidence of
the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim would not be admissible
unless the defendant intends to offer evidence of specific instances of
past sexual behavior and notifies the court in writing at least 15 days
before the trial.  Then a hearing would be held in which the judge
determines whether the evidence is relevant and outweighs the
danger of unfair prejudice against the victim.  If it meets those
criteria, it may be admitted at trial.  Currently, many courts lack
procedures to prevent juries from hearing the embarrassing, yet not
necessarily relevant, disclosures of the alleged victim's sexual history.

<P>De Facto Racial Quotas for the Death Penalty.
<P>
          In what Biden calls the Racial Justice Act of 1991,
Section 2922(a), states:  "No person shall be put to death...  if that
person's death furthers a racially discriminatory pattern." ( S.  618,
Chapter 177, section 2922 (a).)  This means that if 70 percent of all
murderers are white, then 70 percent of all death penalties must be
carried out against white people.  Importantly, it also means that if 80
percent of all murder victims are black, 80 percent of all death
penalties must be carried out against people who murder blacks.  If a
contrary statistical pattern emerges, the Biden bill stipulates the
government must show through "clear and convincing evidence" that
non-racial factors "persuasively" explain the disparity.  Thus, a new
round of trials, hearings and appeals would be tacked on to already
lengthy criminal procedures and protections.  Justice no longer would
aim solely at punishing an individual criminal for his or her individual
crime.
<P>
 <B> EVALUATING THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Biden bills will cost taxpayers almost $4 billion a year. 
Yet there is little indication that this spending significantly would
reduce violent crime.  Example:  Of the $1 billion meant for state
and local law enforcement, New York City's share would probably
place no more than two additional policemen on the street per shift,
per precinct. 
<P>
           The other spending provisions also are unlikely to
reduce crime rates noticeably.  The drug prisons will hold only 12,000. 
The boot camps for young, first-time offenders will hold only a
maximum of 3,000 inmates.  The Biden package thus would do little
to ease prison overcrowding.  It is estimated, for example, that the
states need an extra 500,000 spaces for prisoners.  As bad, the Biden
package ignores a key proposal to help states with overcrowded
prisons:  H.R.  1001 sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican, would change the federal tax code to allow tax
exempt state bonds issued to finance private prisons.  Biden failed to
include a similar measure which would combat the high cost of
constructing and maintaining new facilities.
<P>
          In contrast to most of the Biden package, the proposal
for a ROTC-like program to train 20,000 police annually has merit. 
College educated police tend to set higher standards for themselves. 
No new funds, however, need to be spent on this ROTC.  The $430
million annual cost of the program should be paid with money
currently available in the Department of Education budget.
<P>
          Biden's legislation is not the major assault on America's
crime problem that he claims; it is not even a minor assault.  If his
real goal is to encourage experimentation, then he should leave this
to the states, which traditionally have been America's best
laboratories of social experiment. 
<P>
           Biden's package, moreover, errs seriously in increasing
federal involvement in the fight against violent street crime.  Fighting
crime -- like collecting garbage, fire-fighting or lighting streets -- is a
state and local responsibility.  Entangling the federal government in
the battle against street crime muddies the lines of responsibility and
creates confusion over which officials should be held accountable for
the local crime situation.  If citizens want another policeman on their
block, they should not have to call their Congressman, who might
then try to prod a lethargic federal bureaucracy. 
<P>

 <B> HOW THE STATES CAN FIGHT CRIME </B>
<P>
      Crime is the ultimate local problem.  Often attacker and
victim come from the same neighborhood, and almost always from
the same city or county.  Localities, moreover, fight crime differently. 
This leads to experiments that reveal what works and what does not.
<P>
          States should encourage such innovation by their cities
and counties.  States also can take other actions to bolster local
police effectiveness.  For one thing, states might spend more money
on prosecutors and judges if the courts are the source of delays in
criminal proceedings.  This would make real to criminals the threat of
a trial, conviction and punishment. 
<P>
           For another thing, states can add prison capacity.  If
funds are short, the states could turn to private companies to
construct and operate prisons.  In Louisiana and Kentucky, among
other states, this has cut costs.  Indeed, a National Institute of Justice
study conservatively estimated savings at between 4 percent and 15
percent in privately run prisons. ( Charles H.  Logan and Bill W. 
McGriff, "Comparing Costs of Public and Private Prisons:  A Case
Study," NIJ Reports, National Institute of Justice, U.S.  Department
of Justice, September/October 1989.)  With such savings possible,
state and local governments could afford to build more cells each
year.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The antidote to violent street crime lies in the hands of state
and local officials and the voters who elect them.  States and
localities can hire more judges, prosecutors and public defenders; can
appoint and elect judges who will enforce the law rather than bend
the state constitutions to favor criminals; and can hire private firms to
build and manage their prisons.       
<P>
          The federal government, of course, has a role in
fighting crime.  It can keep interstate criminal records such as
photographs and fingerprints, maintain nationwide crime statistics,
continue to research high technology police methods, and handle such
interstate problems as organized crime.  But, the day-to-day police
work, prosecutions and imprisonments must be left to local
authorities.  Washington-based officials know this.  They thus should
stop misleading voters by claiming that the federal government can
have a big impact on violent street crime.
<P>
          Of the two major crime packages being considered by
Congress, the Bush version is the better.  It makes reasonable
proposals to ensure that the guilty go to jail, and once in jail, restrains
convicts from jamming the federal courts with frivolous habeas corpus
petitions.  Furthermore, the Bush package does not inject the federal
government significantly into local problems.
<P>
          By contrast, the Biden package assumes that
Washington can solve America's crime problems if only the federal
government spends enough money.  It unduly would expand,
moreover, the role of federal law enforcement in local crime fighting
-- something that if done on a small scale will have little impact, and
if done on a large scale, can threaten civil liberties.  And the Biden
package actually takes a racial quota approach to death penalty
executions.
<P>
          The principal job of government is to protect the life,
liberty and property of the citizens.  Crime prevention thus is a
matter demanding the highest attention of government.  But it is at
the state and local level that the criminal justice system, from the
policeman on the street to the judges in the courtroom to the prison,
succeeds or fails in its task.  More direct federal intervention, as
mandated by the Biden package, would add more confusion and
bureaucracy, making the crime problem not better, but worse.<P>

<title>An Empowerment Strategy for Eliminating Neighborhood Crime -- Heritage</title>

<h3> AN EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY FOR ELIMINATING NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME </h3>

By Carl F. Horowitz, Ph.D.<BR>
 Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 814<br>
March 25, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>




<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     A common and false allegation about urban life in America is that
conditions in poor neighborhoods "force" residents into a life of
crime. This view initially gained popularity after the urban rioting
of the 1960s, specifically in the report of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission
Report. 
<P>
While some criminologists hold that poor neighborhoods are
"breeding grounds" for crime, evidence shows these experts actually
reverse the real sequence of events. It is not that poverty in general
breeds crime; it is crime, especially violent crime, that exacerbates
poverty in neighborhoods. (See data in John J. DiLulio, Jr., "The
Impact of Inner-City Crime," The Public Interest, Number 96, Summer
1989, pp. 28-46.) Crime makes not only the victim, but also the
neighborhood poorer. Crime sets in motion a cycle of flight by law-
abiding citizens, and disinvestment in housing and business; this then
triggers further flight that devastates the poorest neighborhoods and
communities, dooming to failure even well-designed anti-poverty
efforts. 
<P>
     Ultimate Tax. Writes former Director of the National Institute of
Justice, James K. Stewart: "Crime is the ultimate tax on enterprise.
It must be reduced or eliminated before poor people can fully share in
the American dream." (James K. Stewart, "The Urban Strangler: How
Crime Causes Poverty in the Inner City," Policy Review, Number 37,
Summer 1986, p. 8.) Controlling crime is a precondition to improving
the lives of the urban poor because no neighborhood can grow
economically unless it is first safe. As sociologist Charles Murray,
Visiting Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, notes, the key
to reducing crime is to create an atmosphere of lawfulness. (Charles
Murray, "Crime in America," National Review, June 10, 1988, p. 35.)
Low-income neighborhoods explicitly should project the message to the
would-be criminal, whether a resident or not, that crime is not
tolerated, that moral principles are observed and enforced. 
<P>
     Government at all levels must launch an aggressive strategy to
create such an atmosphere if a national urban anti-poverty effort is
to succeed. This strategy especially should explore ways of involving
the law-abiding urban poor in anti-crime activities. In this
empowerment strategy, the poor themselves work with police and other
local officials to identify sources of potential crime and restrict
access of potential criminals to their neighborhoods and housing
projects. In particular:<ul>
<P>
<li> Local governments should help neighborhood groups form anti-crime
     patrols, stimulate interest among residents in joining existing
     patrols, and hire private guards to augment the activities of
     local police forces. Public housing projects as well as more
     traditional neighborhoods should be the focus of such efforts.
<P><li>
     State legislatures should require stricter sentencing for repeat
     offenders and for all offenders convicted of using firearms in
     committing a burglary or robbery.
<P><li>
     The federal government should beef up the efforts of cabinet-
     level agencies, particularly the Department of Justice and the
     Department of Housing and Urban Development, to stem violent
     crime and drug dealing in housing projects. 
<P><li>
     Congress should make real the threat to stop funding the Legal
     Services Corporation if this agency continues to defend the
     "civil rights" of drug dealers facing eviction from public
     housing. 
<P><li>
     Most important by far, the President and the rest of the federal
     government should emphasize to the American public and
     particularly to the minority community that crime is less the
     outcome of poverty than its cause, and that until strenuous and
     innovative efforts are taken to defeat crime in the inner city
     anti-poverty programs cannot succeed.</ul>
<P>

<B> CRIME AND THE LOW-INCOME URBAN POOR: THE HIDDEN COSTS</B>
<P>
     Crime is increasing rapidly in America's cities. By November of
last year, eight of the twenty largest cities already had set new
records for homicides in a single year. (These and all other
statistics on crime incidence, unless otherwise noted, are derived
from local police departments and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, released semi-annually and
annually. The data reflect only those crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies, not necessarily the total crimes committed. The
crimes are separated into violent crimes (murder, forcible rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson).) By year's end, New
York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston easily had broken
records set in 1989. The more than 2,200 people murdered in New York
City alone represented a more than 10 percent increase over the 1989
figure. In Washington, D.C., the 434 murders in 1989 and 483 murders
in 1990 amounted to one murder for about every 1,400 residents. 
<P>
     Horror stories abound. In Detroit, an annual pre-Halloween arson
rampage, customarily known as "Devil's Night," torched hundreds of
buildings this October 29th through 31st, despite maximum precautions
taken by local officials. ("Halloween Fires, Arrests Rose in Detroit,"
Washington Times, November 5, 1990.) Remarked one resident living next
to a home that burned two years ago, "I'm afraid. It's like you're a
prisoner in your own house. I wouldn't go out." ("Detroit Pulls Out
All Stops to Foil Arson on Devil's Night," Washington Times, October
31, 1990.) 
<P>
     Most obvious, of course, are the immediate costs of crime; the
victim's injuries or loss of some wealth. The poor usually suffer most
not just because they have little wealth to lose but also because they
live in neighborhoods where crimes are common. Less obvious but often
more important, are the indirect costs of crime, affecting not only
the person robbed but anybody living in the same neighborhood. These
indirect costs are of two types: crime that creates poverty among the
innocent, whether or not they have been actual crime victims, and
crime that creates poverty among criminals. 
<P>

<B> How The Innocent Pay</B>
<P>
     Fear of crime forces innocent people into forms of behavior that
would be unnecessary in a crime-free environment. The fear of being
beaten, robbed, or murdered can make it impossible for residents of a
crime-infested neighborhood to become productive employees or business
owners. Writes the National Institute of Justice's Stewart: "The
traditional means by which poor people have advanced themselves --
overtime, moonlighting, education to improve future opportunities --
can be easily obstructed by crime and fear. Why risk a late job or
night school if the return home means waiting at deserted bus stops
and walking past crowds of threatening teenagers?" (Stewart, "The
Urban Strangler," p. 6.)
<P>
     Perhaps nothing illustrates the fear gripping so many of today's
low-income urban neighborhoods than the construction by the City of
Los Angeles of a concrete wall around one of its junior high schools
to keep stray bullets from hitting children on the playground. (James
Q. Wilson and John J. DiLulio, Jr., "Crackdown," New Republic, July
10, 1989, p. 21.) 
<P>
     Depressing Property Values. Fear of criminals depresses the
willingness of families to move into and stay in neighborhoods. This
then depresses property values. If potential buyers of property,
whether occupied or vacant, believe that it is in a high-crime
neighborhood, they offer a lower price for the property than they
would have in the absence of crime. (For evidence that crime hurts
property values, see Wesley G. Skogan, Disorder and Decline: Crime and
the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods (New York: Free Press,
1990), pp. 65-84. See also R. P. Taub, Paths of Neighborhood Change:
Race and Crime in Urban America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1984).) 
<P>
     This has a devastating effect on the poor. If they are homeowners
-- many poor own their own homes (Thirty-eight percent of America's
below-poverty-line households own their own homes, and 58 percent of
these are non-elderly. See Robert Rector, Kate Walsh O'Beirne, and
Michael McLaughlin, "How 'Poor' Are America's Poor?" Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 791, September 21, 1990, p. 9.) -- their
principal asset is devalued. This is the equivalent of criminals
robbing a family's savings account. If residents are apartment owners,
they may be unable to find any buyers when they wish to sell, and they
have difficulty finding responsible renters. This in turn discourages
the landlord from spending money on maintenance, which in turn
triggers the cycle of crime and further decay.
<P>
     Housing Stock Deteriorates. Even those owners who want to improve
their property are deterred by crime. Since crime reduces property
values, homeowners and apartment owners alike may find it very
difficult to obtain credit for purchase or improvement loans. The
result: The housing stock deteriorates despite intentions of owners.
Much of the "redlining" allegedly practiced by mortgage lenders (a
practice by which lenders designate certain neighborhoods as too risky
for loans) actually is a rational response to fears that falling real
property values will impose a huge loss on the lenders in the event of
default. For this reason even creditworthy borrowers in such
neighborhoods are denied the capital to improve their properties.
Explains a resident of a heavily vandalized Chicago neighborhood: "If
you tell a bank that it is the Wicker Park area you want to buy into,
they'll refuse you credit." (Skogan, Disorder and Decline, p. 79.)
<P>
     Enormous Burdens. The resulting property deterioration and
subsequent abandonment is documented in every urban neighborhood in
America where criminals reign. It is especially true in public
housing. In Chicago, for example, over 5,000 publicly-owned dwellings
stand vacant, most as a result of vandalism and youth gang violence.
(John McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?" Newsweek, January, 2,
1989, pp. 24-26.) In New Orleans' decaying Desire housing project,
sixteen residents were slain in just the first nine months of 1990.
(Guy Gugliotta and Michael Isikoff, "Violence in the '90s: Drugs'
Deadly Residue," Washington Post, October 14, 1990.)
<P>
     Tallied among crime's costs too are the higher taxes paid by all
of a city's residents, including those in high-crime neighborhoods,
because of the heavy cost of police protection and running courts,
jails, and prisons. Violent crime also imposes enormous burdens on the
health and social service systems. 
<P>
     In cities of more than 500,000 people, police, fire protection,
and social service portions of municipal budgets not only rose rapidly
during the 1980s, they did so at rates well exceeding the overall
municipal budgets. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, City Government
Finances, Series GF, No. 4 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office), annually.) In Washington, D.C., during 1982-1987, for
example, expenditures for these three combined areas rose by 66.2
percent, compared with the increase for the entire local budget of
43.3 percent. 
<P>
     Crime-Expenditure Linkage. Yet when local governments respond to
the costs of crime by raising taxes or fees, they risk driving out
law-abiding residents and businesses. Cities faced with high crime
rates typically face heavy tax burdens. An analysis of crime and taxes
over a 30-year period by Northwestern University political scientist
Herbert Jacob reveals just how close the crime-expenditure linkage is.
While all cities in a ten-city survey showed large increases in police
expenditures, by far the ones with the largest increases were the ones
with the highest increases in crime rates. (Herbert Jacob, "Policy
Responses to Crime," in Paul Peterson, ed., The New Urban Reality
(Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1985), pp. 225-52.)
<P>
     Another cost of crime is that employers are reluctant to expand
or relocate in high-crime neighborhoods even if given economic
development incentives. When an office, store, or factory is said to
be in a dangerous neighborhood, employers have difficulties finding
and retaining a work force. The evidence on business location
decisions shows that fear of crime strongly encourages employers to
avoid establishing facilities in poor neighborhoods or to relocate
existing facilities to safer neighborhoods or jurisdictions. (Stewart,
"The Urban Strangler," p. 7; DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City
Crime.") If the firm compensates for the fears of employees by
offering higher wages and salaries, its labor costs rise, hence making
it less competitive with firms outside such areas. 
<P>
     Losing Neighborhood Businesses. Local residents, fearing crime,
are unwilling to patronize neighborhood businesses during evening
hours. Business owners may be willing to bear the risk of crime in
order to attract evening customers, but if residents are too
frightened to shop, many of the businesses will not survive. As a
result, many inner city residents no longer enjoy the convenience of
having neighborhood stores. A lengthy trip thus may be required for
groceries, clothing, and other household goods. 
<P>
     New small businesses in high-crime areas often cannot obtain
property insurance or small business loans except at high rates -- if
at all. Small business in New York City alone loses about $1 billion a
year from arson, shoplifting, burglary, robbery, and other crimes.
(Cited in George F. Will, "Giuliani: He's No Fiorello," Washington
Post, October 26, 1989.) Such crimes can be calamities for inner city
businesses. The recent default by investors in a commercial mall in a
high-crime area in the Northeast section of Washington, D.C.,
underscores how retail activity housed in a new, attractive complex,
even with substantial pre-opening publicity, may not be able to
survive.
<P>
     When fear of crime drives out or cuts back the hours of
neighborhood enterprises, employment opportunities shrink. This is
especially harmful to teenagers seeking their first jobs. If they are
to enjoy productive lives as adults, avoiding the welfare dependency
trap, they must develop marketable skills before they enter adulthood.
<P>
     Fear in Schools. Urban schools deteriorate. According to Karl
Zinsmeister, crime and education expert at the American Enterprise
Institute, each year about 3 million crimes are attempted or completed
inside schools or on school grounds. (Karl Zinsmeister, "Growing Up
Scared," Atlantic, June 1990, p. 61. All the educational data here
come from this article.) Assaults alone constitute about 10 percent of
these offenses. The response to the climate of fear by some children
is to avoid school altogether. A significant portion of today's
truancy problem, observes Zinsmeister, results from a child's fear of
being terrorized. He notes that about 8 percent of all urban junior
and senior high school students miss at least one day of classes each
month because they fear physical assault by other students. It is not
simply students who are fearful. According to Zinsmeister, about one
in five teachers are assaulted on the job each year, with 12 percent
hesitant to confront the guilty party for fear of reprisal. Not
surprisingly, talented and ambitious teachers will avoid transfers to
crime-ridden schools, reducing the ability of the school to provide a
good education.
<P>
<B> How Even Criminals Eventually Pay</B>
<P>
     When a criminal robs a business owner or pedestrian of cash, or
receives hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a single drug deal,
naturally he feels this beats what he may see as a low-paying "dead
end" job. As Robert J. DeFauw, former Director of the Detroit office
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), noted in 1984: "Our
major problem is, how are we going to reach these kids? I mean, do you
tell them to work at J.L. Hudson's for $45 a week when they're making
$2,000 a week selling drugs on the street? They'll just laugh at you."
(Howard Blum, "U.S. Helps Detroit to Attack Drug Rings," New York
Times, January 28, 1984.) His words remain applicable today.
<P>
     Despite what appear to be financial advantages for the criminal,
the evidence shows that he or she, too, ultimately becomes a victim.
This is true for several reasons.
<P>
     First, an inner city criminal career often leads to serious
injury or death. In Washington, D.C., for example, police estimate
that over half of the murders in their jurisdiction during 1985-1988
involved a dispute between drug dealers. (U.S. News and World-Report,
"Dead Zones," Special Report, April 10, 1989, p. 25.) 
<P>
     Second, while an individual crime results in incarceration less
than 2 percent of the time, (U.S. Department of Justice, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Crime in the United States (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office), annually.) a teenage criminal faces
strong odds of eventually being arrested and convicted if he maintains
his activity into his 20s. This is because street crime requires
almost daily activity to be profitable. It takes several felonies each
week just to rob the equivalent of what could be earned honestly at a
modest job. (Samuel Walker, Sense and Nonsense About Crime: A Policy
Guide, 2nd ed. (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1989), p. 258.) The
odds catch up with many. Over 3.5 million American adults are on
parole or on probation in addition to the 700,000 currently in state
or federal prisons. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, Probation and Parole 1987, Bulletin NCJ-113948, and
Probation and Parole 1988, Bulletin NCJ-113948, reprinted in U.S.
Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics -- 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department
of Justice, 1990), p. 556.) 
<P>
     Aside from the loss of potential income while in prison, an adult
with a criminal record once released finds himself unemployable in
many jobs. According to a Justice Department study, some 40 percent of
ex-prisoners who have been free for under one year make less than $500
monthly. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, Special Report NCJ-109926
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, January 1988), p. 3.)
With the range of legitimate employment choices diminished, the
temptation to return to the streets is greater. Over 60 percent of
criminals released from prison are rearrested for another offense
within three years, and most of them are convicted. (U.S. Department
of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners
Released in 1983, Special Report NCJ-116261 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Department of Justice, April 1989), p. 5.) According to Washington,
D.C., Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, it is common for the same person,
once out of prison, to be arrested eight or nine times in the same
neighborhood within weeks. (DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime,"
p. 40.) 
<P>
     Third, a criminal's frequent refusal to finish high school
severely reduces lifetime earning capacity. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Recidivism of Prisoners, p. 5. According to this study, 67.3
percent of all sampled released adult prisoners had less than a high
school degree. In fact, close to 20 percent had no education beyond
the 8th grade.) Recent studies show that the decision to drop out of
high school reduces the individual's income over the long run, and
increases the likelihood of unemployment. (Michael McLaughlin, "High
School Dropouts: How Much of a Crisis?" Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 781, August 3, 1990, pp. 8-9; Wayne J. Howe, "Do
Education and Demographics Affect Unemployment Rates?" Monthly Labor
Review, Vol. 111, No. 1, January 1988, pp. 3-9; James P. Markey, "The
Labor Problems of Today's High School Dropouts," Monthly Labor Review,
Vol. 111, No. 6, June 1988, pp. 36-43.) About one in six high school
dropouts are unemployed, a rate roughly triple to that of the general
labor force. (Markey, "The Labor Problems of Today's High School
Dropouts," p. 36.) 
<P>
     The lack of education and the decision to pursue a criminal
career reinforce each other. Just as poor performance in school makes
a life of crime more attractive, a young criminal's initially
successful forays into crime induce him to believe that education
"isn't worth it." This is especially true among minors, because even
if convicted of an offense, they rarely get more punishment than a
warning. Typically, they conclude that crime does pay. (For recent
evidence, see "Kids and Crime," Special Report, Insight, July 30,
1990, pp. 9-13.) 
<P>
     Fourth, criminals are less likely than others to develop the
personality and values necessary for entering into and sustaining a
marriage. They tend to marry less -- fewer than half of the adult
inmates in state prisons ever have been married. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, p. 3.) A stable
marriage not only has the capacity to induce a man to be gainfully
employed, it also steers him away from crime. (See Marvin E. Wolfgang,
Terence P. Thornberry, and Robert M. Figlio, From Boy to Man, from
Delinquency to Crime (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp.
138-43. The authors found that while marriage significantly reduces a
man's willingness to lead a life of crime, merely cohabitating with a
woman and/or fathering her child do not.) If during a marriage, a man
remains a criminal, or reverts to being one, the odds are substantial
that his wife will leave him. With this realization, a man who values
a marriage avoids crime. Equally important, his children are less
likely to become criminals if he stays with his wife. (The evidence is
persuasive that children and teenagers are less likely to grow up with
problems of mental illness, violence, drug use, and poor school
performance when both parents are present in the home. For a review of
recent studies, see Nicholas Davidson, "Life Without Father: America's
Greatest Social Catastrophe," Policy Review, Number 51, Winter 1990,
pp. 40-44.)
<P>

<B> HOW TO REDUCE NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME</B>
<P>
     There is a growing realization that the best strategies for
fighting crime in residential neighborhoods are those where the police
work closely with resident organizations. Such community-based
strategies require residents to believe that others in their
neighborhood are committed to a crime-free environment. Then they will
be more willing to take part in public or private anti-crime programs,
and be mobilized by police forces. "Community-oriented policing," as
this is known, attempts to prevent crimes rather than investigate them
after the fact. As crime experts James Q. Wilson, Collins Professor of
Management at UCLA, and George Kelling, Fellow at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Community-oriented policing means changing the daily work of
     the police to include investigating problems as well as
     incidents. It means defining as a problem whatever a
     significant body of public opinion regards as a threat to
     community order. It means working with the good guys, and
     not just against the bad guys. (James Q. Wilson and George
     L. Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," Atlantic, February
     1989, p. 49.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Community groups and police forces now have a considerable body
of experience drawn from successful experiments in community-oriented
policing. This evidence suggests that several tactics are key to a
successful approach, and that government policies can help in a number
of ways. Among these:
<P>
1) Create more police foot patrols. 
<P>
     The evidence indicates that deploying more foot patrol police
officers in a high-crime neighborhood can make substantial headway
against crime. Charleston, South Carolina, is a case in point. (Edwin
Meese III and Bob Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," Policy Review,
Number 54, Fall 1990, pp. 26-27; Suzanne Fields, "Safer with Fleetfeet
on the Beat," Washington Times, November 8, 1990.) When Reuben
Greenberg in 1982 took over as Police Chief of that city of 80,000, he
inherited one of the nation's most crime-ridden cities for its size.
One of his first steps to tackle the problem was to create an elite
unit of foot patrolmen. Friendly and cooperative with neighbors, yet
tough and agile enough to chase and catch a fleeing suspect, these
patrolmen have deterred criminals, especially drug dealers, from
preying on poor neighborhoods.
<P>
     Under Greenberg, crime in Charleston has fallen 42 percent. So
successful is his strategy viewed that he was invited early last year
by Mobile, Alabama, with a population of 200,000, to design a similar
program for that city. Five months after Mobile adopted the Greenberg
plan, Mobile's serious crime fell by 18 percent. (Ed Foster-Simeon, "A
Matter of Taking Back City Streets," Washington Times, November 6,
1990.)
<P>
     Results from other cities are also encouraging. In Flint,
Michigan, a city of nearly 150,000, foot patrol officers since 1979
have been trained to refer citizens to social service agencies when
the police detect domestic problems or alcohol and drug abuse. The
idea is to prevent residents with such problems from falling into a
pattern of crime. In the fourteen experimental areas established by
the Flint police as high-crime districts, crime rates declined an
average of 8 percent in the first three years of the program; by
contrast, rates rose 10 percent in areas without the program. (Meese
and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp. 23-24.) In Los Angeles, a
foot patrol program, Secured Areas Footbeat Enforcement (SAFE), begun
last year but now discontinued due to budget cuts, was popular in
several of that city's poorer neighborhoods.

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Foot patrol programs have proven to be a successful method of
deterring street crime. The U.S. Justice Department and state justice
departments should consider making law enforcement assistance to
localities contingent upon local government at least exploring the
merits of a police or private guard foot patrol program. 
<P>
2) Create citizen patrols. 
<P>
     Unarmed community volunteers, working together and with the local
police force also seem able to deter street crime. Like police foot
patrols, their presence itself warns drug dealers and other criminals
that the neighborhood has been put "off-limits."
<P>
     A good example is in Washington, D.C., where more than 130
neighborhood crime watch groups involve about 6,000 residents. In
several neighborhoods, residents armed with video cameras and walkie-
talkies film drug transactions and write down license plate numbers,
later relaying the information to the police. The aim is to target
drug customers rather than dealers, and thus to reduce the demand for
drugs. Their effort has closed dozens of crack houses and reduced
open-air drug dealing. Other Washington neighborhoods have expressed
enthusiasm for similar groups.          
<P>
     Establishing community patrols makes residents appreciate their
own power to change the neighborhood. Explains Jim Foreman,
coordinator of the Metro Orange Coalition, the umbrella organization
for local crime watch groups in Washington, "Usually when you go out
to see a group, they are afraid about what is on the street. Once you
get them there, they see the power of togetherness, what they can do."
(Mark Vane, "Community Patrols Help in Drug War," Washington Times,
November 26, 1990.)
<P>
     The Guardian Angels pioneered such neighborhood patrols. The
organization first gained national attention a decade ago for their
efforts in fighting crime in New York City's subways. No volunteer
organization has done more to make America's streets less dangerous.
With dozens of active chapters, the Guardian Angels are scrupulous
about maintaining good relations with local police. They enter a
community only at the invitation of residents. They have substantially
reduced crime in a number of Washington, D.C.-area apartment
complexes. ("Apartment Security Is Heaven-Sent," Insight, June 4,
1990, pp. 20-22.) The Angels have worked hard at building a reservoir
of good will among public officials. Francis Keating, General Counsel
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
acknowledges that they are a key element in HUD's Drug Elimination
Program, which makes available grants to housing authorities to assist
in the elimination of drug-related crime in public housing projects.
(Ibid., p. 22.)
<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Governments should seek ways to establish citizen crime patrol
programs in low-income neighborhoods. The bureaucratic obstacles to
such arrangements have been overcome where neighborhood groups and
police work closely. HUD, for example, works with housing authorities
around the country in providing technical assistance to tenant anti-
crime patrols. In Baltimore, for instance, elderly residents in the
city's public housing projects, with walkie-talkies, report to local
police suspicious and illegal behavior they see. 
<P>
     Localities should encourage low-income resident associations to
take the lead in establishing patrols. Beside patrolling, these
patrols could provide literature to neighborhood residents to
encourage them to leave on their lights at night, trim their shrubs
and bushes for greater visibility, and arrange for the Post Office not
to deliver mail when they are out of town. These groups also could
give city building inspection and police departments information on
vacant dwellings, especially those that may function as drug houses.
<P>
3) Make public housing safe. 
<P>
     Crime rates in public housing projects tend to exceed the city
average. Thus, while Chicago's serious crime rate already is almost
quadruple the national average, the rate in three of its most
notorious projects -- Cabrini-Green, Stateway Gardens, and Rockwell
Gardens -- ranges from double to quadruple even that of the whole
city. (McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?") 
<P>
     In the late-1980s, federal and local agencies began taking
decisive action to tackle public housing project crime. HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp was prompted to do so after the March 1989 murder of an
Alexandria, Virginia, police officer who tackled a crack dealer
holding a tenant hostage in a public housing project. It subsequently
was learned that other project residents knew that the apartment long
had been used for drug dealing and had complained to housing
officials. Complex eviction procedures, however, had made it
impossible to remove the drug-dealing tenants. Under this procedure,
it normally took one to two years to evict someone from public
housing. Since the Alexandria murder, HUD has waived these eviction
requirements for close to 40 states and the District of Columbia.
(James P. Moran, Jr., "High Noon in Alexandria: How We Ran the Crack
Dealers Out of Public Housing," Policy Review, Number 53, Summer 1990,
pp. 78-81.)
<P>
     A police response to public housing tenant requests for better
protection can reduce crime. When the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA)
in late 1988 asked police to raid suspected gang hideouts and crack
dens in one of the Rockwell Gardens buildings, violence dropped
dramatically, and residents no longer felt they had to sleep in
closets and bathtubs for safety from flying bullets. (McCormick, "Can
Chicago Beat the Odds?" pp. 24-25. For an excellent full treatment of
reforms recently undertaken in Chicago's public housing program, see
Andrew Cooper, Enabling the Underclass: Vince Lane's Campaign to
Restore Rights and Responsibilities in Chicago's Public Housing,
Public Entrepreneurship Series, No. 2 (Washington, D.C.: Progressive
Policy Institute, December 1990).) CHA Director Vincent Lane vows to
make every project free of gangs and drugs. Similar results were
reported in a get-tough program started by Omaha's Housing Authority.
(Robert L. Armstrong, "Something Upbeat Is Going On in Omaha's Public
Housing," Governing, December 1990, pp. 36-41.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Public housing authorities should establish comprehensive
programs to combat crime and drug abuse in public housing. These
programs should include better screening of prospective tenants;
neighborhood foot patrols; information-sharing with police and housing
authorities on criminals, suspected drug activity, and vacant
apartments; and tenant drug education and referral outreach services. 
<P>
     In each program, tenant involvement is critical. Without it, the
fear established by drug dealers and other criminals will not be
removed. The housing authorities of Orlando, Florida, and Savannah,
Georgia, have taken major steps in this direction. In both cities,
police act as community organizers working closely with tenants.
Officers take children on field trips and to ball games, introducing
them to a world of non-criminal activities. As a result of this, drug
activity in projects of both cities, especially Savannah, has been
greatly reduced. ("Orlando, Savannah Report Success in Fighting Drug
Problem," Housing and Development Reporter, January 21, 1991, p. 790.)
<P>
     With the enactment last fall by Congress of the HOPE
(Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere) program, the
federal government now can play an important role in reducing public
housing crime. HOPE provides funding to tenant organizations to manage
or own their housing projects, and puts housing authorities in a
better position to eliminate public housing decay. When law-abiding
tenants have responsibilities in running their projects, they will be
apt to take action against the criminal element. HUD should further
streamline its eviction procedure for all states in response to
widespread tenant complaints. Because drug dealing is often a family
activity, the new procedure, where based on good evidence, should
allow for the eviction of the family.
<P>
     Misguided Defenders. The primary obstacles to ridding projects of
criminals, especially drug dealers, are the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), and the federally-funded Legal Services Corporation, and
the backing these groups receive from their allies in Congress. These
organizations consistently have opposed eviction and other crime
prevention measures in public housing on the grounds that they violate
the civil rights of low-income persons. That most tenants in housing
projects are both poor and law-abiding, and that they plead for such
action, apparently is of little concern to these radical legal
organizations. Congress should consider eliminating support of the
Legal Services Corporation if it continues to use any money for
defending drug dealers. 
<P>
4) Hire quality private security guards. 
<P>
     When security guards work closely with residents and police, they
can be a valuable tool in reducing crime in low-income neighborhoods.
Between 1975 and 1988, the number of private security guards increased
from 400,000 to 1.4 million nationwide. By contrast, the number of
full-time public police officers rose from 400,000 to just 600,000
during this period. (Richard Neely, "Law and Order -- Do It Yourself,"
Washington Post, October 21, 1990.) 
<P>
     Private security guards normally are not as well-trained as
policemen, and usually carry no firearms. Yet they can be an effective
and comparatively inexpensive addition to police forces if both
cooperate and communicate closely. According to Richard Neely, Chief
Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and a recognized
crime expert, it costs far more to put a uniformed police officer than
a private guard on the street. (Ibid.) This is because guards are
hired to prevent crimes rather than investigate them. The average
police officer spends about two percent of his or her time actively
patrolling, with the bulk of time devoted to such activities as
responding to calls, doing paperwork, and testifying in court. Private
guards devote about 90 percent of their time to patrolling and crime
prevention.
<P>
     The use of private guards, paid and volunteer, has cut crime in
housing projects in the nation, particularly in Starrett City, a
moderate-income high-rise apartment development in New York City, and
in drug-infested Mayfair Mansions, a Washington, D.C. public housing
complex whose tenants for years had been calling upon the housing
authority to take action. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local government and housing authorities can hire private
security guards from among residents of low-income neighborhoods and
housing projects themselves. Training such persons to be guards, who
work closely with police, would announce clearly that a neighborhood
will be thoroughly patrolled, even if not by police. It also would
provide primary or secondary employment for these residents. HUD
allows payment for such guards from federal Drug Elimination Act funds
and the public housing operating budget. 
<P>
5) Clean up neighborhoods. 
<P>
     The worse a neighborhood looks, the more crime it tends to
suffer. According to UCLA's Wilson and Harvard's Kelling, broken
glass, uncollected trash, abandoned cars, graffiti, vagrants, and
prostitutes proclaim to criminal and resident alike that a community
cares little about what happens in its streets. (James Q. Wilson and
George L. Kelling, "Broken Windows," Atlantic, March 1982, pp. 29-38;
see also Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe.") This is an
open invitation to criminals and helps drive away those who otherwise
might live or open businesses there. This is confirmed statistically
by recent research, especially by the Director of Northwestern
University's Program in Law and the Social Sciences, Wesley G. Skogan.
(Skogan, Disorder and Decline. See also Daniel Lewis and Greta Salem,
Fear of Crime: Incivility and the Production of a Social Problem (New
Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1986); D.J. Kenny, Crime, Fear,
and the New York City Subways (New York: Praeger, 1987).) 
<P>
     The reverse also is true. When residents take the simple step of
cleaning their neighborhood, it tells criminals that the residents
care about their community and thus are more likely to report criminal
behavior. Where conscientiously applied, a clean-up strategy cuts
crime. Example: The New Briarfield Apartments in Newport News,
Virginia, suffered a massive increase in crime during the mid-1980s,
terrorizing its low-income residents, and driving many away. Nearly
one-fourth of the apartments were being burglarized at least once a
year. In an attempt to take control of the neighborhood away from the
criminals, the police in 1984 began to work with other municipal
agencies and with tenants in launching a campaign to clean up trash,
fill potholes, haul away abandoned cars, and sweep the streets. The
result was a 35 percent decline in burglaries within three years.
(Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," pp. 46-47.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local governments should sponsor frequent community clean-up days
in high-crime neighborhoods. Working with resident organizations,
state and local governments can be more diligent about towing away
abandoned vehicles. New York City is now aggressively removing
graffiti from public buildings and subway cars and stations; other
cities with graffiti problems should follow New York's lead. Graffiti
vandals, especially gang members who typically use graffiti to mark
turf, should be dealt with harshly by the courts and sentenced to
perform community service in addition to serving a jail term.
<P>
     One obstacle to a clean-up program is the unwillingness of local
bureaucracies to encroach upon each others' territories. To avoid
this, separate inter-agency task forces should be created, with
employees from various agencies consulting with neighborhood residents
in developing strategies in their own agency's programs. (Ibid., p.
52.) 
<P>
     Additionally, local governments should privatize sanitation,
street cleaning, public housing management, and certain other
services. Through privatization, these services would be provided more
efficiently, and at lower cost. As a result, fewer "broken windows"
would be visible to the criminal.
<P>
6) Create physical barriers to crime. 
<P>
     An increasingly common technique of community policing is
limiting access to a neighborhood. In many cases, the police, with the
cooperation of resident leaders, erect barricades and guard posts at
street intersections. Well-known is the Los Angeles Police
Department's "Operation Cul-de-Sac." (See discussions of the program
in Eloise Salholz, "The 'Walled Cities' of L.A.," Newsweek, May 14,
1990, pp. 24-25; Meese and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp.
27-28.) When a crack cocaine epidemic hit the south Los Angeles
neighborhood of Newton in the late-1980s, gang members terrorized the
neighborhood. Of the 873 murders in Los Angeles in 1989, 100 were in
Newton. 
<P>
     Working with residents, police created a "Narcotics Enforcement
Area" in February 1990. Police limited access to the community by
constructing entry gates at street entrances and exits. They also
interrogated suspicious persons where there was a legal basis to do
so. As a psychological barrier, the police put up the sign, "OPEN TO
RESIDENTS ONLY" at each gate. The program enjoyed the strong support
of the residents, many of whom had been too terrified to leave their
homes after dusk. Within six weeks, violent crime in Newton had fallen
by 90 percent; attendance at the nearby 2,600-student Jefferson High
School had risen by 150 to 200 students a day; and residents
rededicated a park that previously had been controlled by gangs. Then
the barricades were removed -- and crime, including several drive-by
shootings -- returned. The police brought back the barricades. Los
Angeles police also instituted street barricade programs in the
Sepulveda area of the San Fernando Valley. Within months, crime had
been cut by about one-third. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Through close links with community leaders, local governments can
adopt the tactics of Operation Cul-de-Sac to limit access to some
neighborhoods. This of course needs broad neighborhood support, lest
the operation harass and thus anger law-abiding persons living in,
visiting, or passing through these neighborhoods. Police departments,
with the help of neighborhood groups, should identify where the crime
problems are, and then cordon off the key intersections and provide
residents with opportunities to report suspicious-looking behavior. 
<P>
     One possibility is privatization of streets. St. Louis, for
example, since the 19th century has had America's most extensive
system of privately-owned and maintained residential streets. Though
originally seen as a way of avoiding the city's taxing and spending
limitations, one of its side effects has been crime prevention. (Oscar
Newman, Community of Interest, (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1981),
pp. 124-56.) 
<P>
7) Steer children away from crime. 
<P>
     The evidence shows that reaching troubled children during their
pre-adolescent years has the greatest effect on deterring them from
becoming adult criminals. (Wolfgang, Thornberry, and Figlio, From Boy
to Man.) Instilling values of respect for property, hard work, and
respect for the nuclear family reduces criminal behavior. By contrast,
children who become criminals often have suffered parental abuse or
neglect. (According to the director of a Boston-area settlement house,
the incidence of child abuse in underclass families -- black and white
-- is "nearly 100 percent." See Morton Kondracke, "The Two Black
Americas," New Republic, February 6, 1989, p. 19.) 
<P>
     Several police forces well understand the importance of
preventing crime by exposing children to its futility. "We absolutely
have to target the real young kids," states Philadelphia Police
Commissioner Willie Williams, adding that police and community leaders
must "completely educate them about drugs, sex and how to protect
themselves from family members leading them to drugs." (Quoted in Tom
Morganthau, "Children of the Underclass," Newsweek, September 11,
1989, p. 24.) The Los Angeles Police Department's sponsors several
youth intervention programs, such as the Jeopardy Program, in which
officers visit the parents of youth involved with gangs, and DARE
(Drug Abuse Resistance Education), in which officers come into school
classes, and lecture students about the dangers of drug abuse.
Similarly, New York City has launched a program, "Cops and Kids,"
aimed at keeping children in school, improving reading skills,
preventing drug addiction, and creating after-school jobs and sports
programs, among other activities. (Felicia R. Lee, "Havens for Youths
in Anti-Crime Plan," New York Times, October 11, 1990.) These police-
sponsored programs are models for other cities. 
<P>
     Community groups and private institutions have established
similar programs. In Washington, D.C.'s Kenilworth-Parkside Gardens, a
former public housing project now owned by its tenants, the managers
sponsor a program that teaches youths how to develop business skills
that will keep them out of trouble. Children also are employed in
project-sponsored businesses to bake, package, and sell cookies.
Working on commission, many youngsters earn up to $45 a day. (See
DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime," p. 45.) Also, D.C. police
are sponsoring nighttime basketball games to get teenagers off the
streets during hours in which they might be tempted by crime, and
involve them in recreation that tests their strength and athletic
skills. Working with the D.C. local government, the National
Basketball Players' Association, Anheuser-Busch Companies,
Incorporated, and The Coca-Cola Company are acting as co-sponsors of
this "Late Night Hoops" program. (Ruben Castaneda, "'Hoops' Offers
Sanctuary from Streets," Washington Post, November 29, 1990.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     The federal and state government should promote youth
intervention programs. One possibility would be to use Project Head
Start more frequently as a crime prevention program. Local police can
work with parents of assisted children to educate them on the dangers
of drugs.
<P>
     Public school drug education programs should shift some of their
emphasis away from students in high school and junior high schools and
toward those in elementary school, since most -- though not all --
children that age have not yet begun to use drugs and deal in them.
States and localities should establish educational tax credit voucher
programs that enable low-income parents to choose private schools that
provide a drug-free environment.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
     Reducing crime is a key to neighborhood revitalization and
economic improvement. The evidence is clear that one of the best ways
of accomplishing this is by forging resident-police programs to
discourage crimes rather than simply using the police to investigate
crimes after they have happened. Only when residents feel they can
work closely with police will fear of crime subside. 
<P>
     The argument that crime is of secondary concern, and is a
byproduct of poverty, misunderstands the causal relationship between
poverty and crime. Tackling crime is the precondition to a successful
war on poverty -- tackling poverty is not the key to reducing crime.
<P>
     In tackling crime, public officials at all levels must adhere to
the following principles:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> A police anti-crime program in low-income neighborhoods requires
     maximum face-to-face communication with resident leaders.
<P>
     Crime prevention is less expensive and more effective than crime
     investigation.
<P>
     No neighborhood or housing project, no matter how seemingly
     hopeless, can be written off. Success stories can and have
     happened even in the most crime-ridden neighborhoods.
<P>
     Economic development strategies to help the poor will work best
     when linked to areas with local crime prevention programs.
<P>
     Neighborhood space should be perceived by resident and non-
     resident alike as being under control of the law-abiding, not the
     lawless. Removal of graffiti, abandoned housing, litter, and
     other evidence of decay must have a high priority in municipal
     budgets.
<P>
     The drug culture must be eliminated. This means above all
     educating children and adolescents about the destructive and
     self-defeating nature of the drug world, and giving landlords and
     housing authorities the right to evict drug dealers with a
     minimum of impedence from misguided "civil rights" groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Relationships. To rid poor urban neighborhoods of their
criminal element, public officials at all levels must encourage the
creation of new relationships between low-income resident
organizations and local police forces. Central to this strategy is to
give residents the confidence that they can take steps themselves to
reduce crime. In this way, America may one day have a real chance of
declaring victory in a war on urban poverty.

Executive Memorandum No. 441<br>
December 7, 1995<br>
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
<p></center>

The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995, similar versions of which were passed by the House and Senate on September 21 and October 19, respectively, would allow U.S. citizens whose property was confiscated by Fidel Castro to seek compensation in U.S. courts from foreign businesses that now operate on this property. To avoid a threatened Democratic filibuster, the Act's Senate sponsor, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), agreed to remove Title III, which enables U.S. citizens to use U.S. courts to seek compensation for their confiscated properties. Title III is the backbone of the bill and should be re-inserted during the conference committee process.
<p>
When Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, one of his first acts was to outlaw private property and transfer all private-sector assets to the state. As a result, many U.S. companies with manufacturing plants, offices, and other places of business in Cuba were expelled without being compensated for their lost property. Today, in an effort to save his drowning communist economy, Castro intends to sell these properties to investors from Canada, Mexico, Spain, and other countries. Under Title III, U.S. companies whose properties were stolen by Castro could act to discourage foreigners from operating and buying their property by seeking compensation through the U.S. court system.
<p>

<b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act</b>
<p>
There are three main titles in the Cuba bill:<p>
<ul><li>Title I strengthens international sanctions against the Castro regime by urging the President to seek an international embargo in the United Nations Security Council. In addition, this title prohibits indirect financing of Castro by U.S. citizens through loans or lines of credit for business ventures using confiscated U.S. property. It also requires the President to oppose Cuban membership in such international financial institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund until a transitional government is established with a system in place to hold democratic elections.
<p>
<li>Title II specifically instructs the President to develop a strategy to support Cuba's transition to a democratically elected government.
<p>
<li>Title III seeks to protect the interests of U.S. citizens whose property was seized by the Castro regime without due compensation. American citizens could seek restitution from potential foreign investors through the U.S. legal system.
</ul><P>
The House version of the Cuba bill includes all three titles. However, the Senate dropped Title III to prevent a threatened Democratic filibuster and bring the bill to the floor for a vote. <p>

<b>Stolen Property and Ill-Gotten Gains</b>
<p>
U.S. companies have registered close to 6,000 claims related to Cuban confiscation of American property with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission in the Department of Justice. These claims, including 6 percent simple interest, nominally are worth almost $6 billion. However, in today's dollars, they would be worth some $10 billion. Some examples:
<p>
Colgate-Palmolive Company. Colgate-Palmolive owned a soap and detergent manufacturing facility in Cuba before the 1959 revolution. When Castro seized power, Colgate's property was confiscated by the state. Foreign investors from the United Kingdom reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

Owens-Illinois Incorporated. This U.S. glass manufacturer owned and operated a glass and bottle production facility in Cuba before Castro's revolution. The property was confiscated by the Cuban state. Foreign investors from Mexico reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

Freeport-McMoran Incorporated. This U.S. company owned a nickel mining facility in Cuba. Today, foreign investors from Canada reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

ITT Corporation. This American company owned a telecommunications facility in Cuba before the revolution. Today, foreign investors from Mexico reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

<b>Protecting American Property Rights</b>
<p>
Critics argue that Title III is intended to enable exiled Cubans to reclaim their stolen property. In reality, it seeks to guarantee the property rights of Americans regardless of whether they are of Cuban origin. Nearly half of the 6,000 certified property claims filed against Cuba have been registered by some of America's largest companies. <p>

Critics also argue that handling these claims will clog U.S. courts. This is not true. To get a property claim to court under this bill, a claimant must meet a number of stringent conditions: 1) the claimant must be a U.S. citizen; 2) the disputed claim must be valued at over $50,000; 3) a foreign investor must occupy the disputed property after the bill is enacted (thus, the bill is not retroactive); 4) a foreign investor must be given 180 days to vacate the disputed property; and 5) a foreign investor laying claim to U.S. property must hold assets within the continental U.S. before he can be sued in a U.S. court. Only after all of these conditions are met may a U.S. claimant seek action in U.S. courts. Under these strict conditions, most of the 6,000 claims will not be brought to court.<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995 is intended to protect the property rights of U.S. citizens whose property was confiscated by Castro without compensation. Foreign investors operating on these properties have disregarded the rights of U.S. citizens. These rights are recognized by U.S. and international law; they should be recognized by the U.S. Congress as well. It is time not only to end the injustice which Castro started over three decades ago, but to prevent foreign companies from unfairly and undeservedly profiting from Castro's crime.<p><p>

<p>
	Opposition to the Clinton Administration's boldest foreign policy initiative, the intervention in Haiti, has come full circle with the defection of former President Jimmy Carter as an uncritical supporter of Clinton's effort to "restore" democracy to Haiti. It was Carter himself who led the diplomatic team last September that prepared the way for the return of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the removal of the military junta which had replaced him in 1991. Without Carter's participation, it is doubtful that the operation would have succeeded without bloodshed or that the intervention would have been supported by the American people.
<p>
	Now Carter and his staff at the Atlanta-based Carter Center have issued a devastating critique of the political process Aristide has produced in Haiti, particularly the June 25 elections which resulted in a pro-Aristide sweep of local and parliamentary seats. The report, written by Carter confidant and former National Security Council advisor Robert Pastor, amounts to a complete denial of the electoral process's legitimacy. By exposing the true nature of Aristide's one-party ("Lavalas") rule in Haiti, including its widespread corruption, mismanagement, and manipulation of the balloting, the Carter Center (albeit belatedly) has joined other critics of the Clinton Administration's endorsement of Aristide's left-wing dictatorship.
<p>

<b>CARTER'S TURNAROUND</b>
<P>
	Carter's critique of Haiti's democratic progress under Aristide is even more startling when one considers the long political association between the two. When Aristide won Haiti's 1990 presidential election, the Carter Center was at the forefront of groups supporting the results. But relations began to sour within months after Carter paved the way for Aristide's triumphant return in October 1994. By year's end it was becoming apparent to all but the most ideologically driven that Haiti was turning into another one-man dictatorship.
<p>
	Previous Heritage Foundation studies have outlined the authoritarian character of Aristide's political personality, his Marxist beliefs, and the follies of U.S. intervention on his behalf.1 A critical part of Aristide's plan for total power was his illegal and authoritarian command of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), the body responsible for conducting the June elections.2 Sensing trouble, former President Carter revisited Haiti in March 1995 but was formally rebuffed by Aristide and unofficially greeted by hostile crowds and vicious graffiti, all engineered by Lavalas street gangs intent on embarrassing him.
<p>
Thus, the stage was set for the June elections. While the Lavalas victory was expected, not even the most influential of Aristide's private backers, including Jimmy Carter, were prepared for the disgraceful conduct of the government and the Lavalas party. "Of the 13 elections that I have observed," notes Pastor, "the June 25 Haitian elections were the most disastrous technically, with the most insecure count."3  Pastor implicitly indicts Aristide, concluding that "instead of building confidence in an electoral process, the government and the CEP -- by their words, actions and inactions -- eroded confidence. Instead of building bonds with the political parties by listening to their concerns and complaints and responding in an expeditious and helpful manner, the CEP stiff-armed the parties and never responded to their complaints."4
<p>
<b>CLINTON'S DEBACLE</b><p>

	After the intervention of 21,000 U.S. troops, at a cost of $3 billion and in conjunction with 6,000 United Nations forces, the Clinton Administration finds itself forced to defend the Haiti operation as its biggest foreign policy "success."  But the sham elections in Haiti were riddled with graft, fraud, and chaos. They represent a complete denial of democratic rule. The balloting was marked by widespread irregularities:  ballots burned, hundreds of voting stations never opened, and tens of thousands of people never able to vote. "I personally witnessed," writes Pastor, "the compromise of one-third of the ballot boxes in Port-au-Prince."5  Conceding the legitimacy of opposition complaints, he argues that "the international community will not help Haiti's democratic process by being silent or dishonest. It has a responsibility to insist that the parties' concerns be effectively addressed."6
<P>
<b>DEMOCRACY AND HAITI'S FUTURE</b>
<p>
The Carter Center report includes a number of constructive recommendations, both near-term and long-term. Among these are:
<p>
<ul><li>Improved criteria for determining complete reruns of the June 1995 elections;
<p><li>Changes in the composition of the Provisional Electoral Council, to include replacing members chosen by Aristide with candidates chosen by Parliament;

<p><li>A multi-party National Dialogue and companion Task Force to begin the process of political reconciliation;

<p><li>Improved electoral training (including practice runs for future elections) and counting procedures, and strict voting hours;

<p><li>Long-term legal and constitutional reform of Haiti's electoral process.
<p></ul>
	Such measures, if adopted, would improve the performance of Haiti's electoral system, but recent experience and the long history of Haitian politics both indicate that the problems encountered by Clinton's intervention are embedded deeply in Haiti's political culture. If anything, the Aristide elections have magnified these problems for the rest of the world to see. Thus, the Carter Center's dissent from these elections, while fair and constructive, may have missed the central point. As expressed over a century ago by then Princeton professor Woodrow Wilson:  "Democracy... is not created by aspirations or by new faith; it is built up by slow habit...." 7
<P>
The time has not yet arrived to call Haiti a democracy.

<b>A Special Report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</b>
<P>




 Since the U.S. imposed a trade embargo on Cuba 32 years ago,
much has changed in the world of communism.  Fidel Castro's patron,
the Soviet Union, has collapsed.  Communist China is embracing
capitalism.  And Marxist-Leninism is a creed that survives only
in a few dreary outposts like North Korea and Cuba.   
<P>
 Because communism is on the run, some people believe that the
embargo on Cuba should be lifted.   Since the world has changed
so much, they ask, why bother worrying about this last redoubt
of communism in the Caribbean?  Critics of the embargo argue that
Fidel Castro no longer threatens the security and vital national
interests of the United States.  They also insist that the  trade
embargo is a Cold War anachronism that serves only to perpetuate
Castro's stranglehold on the Cuban people.  They maintain that
the  embargo has never worked because Castro remains in power,
and that the best way to encourage economic and democratic reforms
in  Cuba is to end the embargo and trade with Castro.  
<P>
 These  arguments are dangerously misguided.  To be sure, the
world has changed-- but this should not mean that Cuba should
be treated any differently.  In fact, it should not be treated
differently at all.  The point is that while the world has changed,
Cuba has not -- at least not enough to justify lifting the embargo.
  
<P>
 The U.S. imposed the embargo on Cuba because Castro was a communist
dictator who repressed his people, stole the property of foreigners
and threatened U.S. security and interests.   The embargo should
be lifted when Cuba becomes a free-market democracy committed
to the rule of law and peaceful relations with the U.S. and its
neighbors.  So far these conditions have not been met.   Fidel
Castro remains a repressive dictator who still threatens U.S.
 security and interests.  Moreover, ending the trade embargo now
would not promote economic and democratic reforms in Cuba.  
<P>
 Castro has no intention of allowing a free market economy in
Cuba, and he will never permit free democratic elections in Cuba
as long as he remains in power.  Castro does not believe in free
markets and democratic government.  Castro wants to supplant the
subsidies of his former Soviet patrons with new financing provided
by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and other
multilateral institutions.  Castro wants the world's democratic
governments, taxpayers in free societies and private investors
to provide his communist dictatorship the financial means to prolong
the captivity of the Cuban people indefinitely.
<P>
 Lifting the embargo would not hasten the end of Castro's regime,
but prolong it.  It would not ease the remaining threats to U.S.
security but perpetuate them.  And it would not create a free-market
democracy in Cuba, but rather give a new lease on life to an authoritarian
socialism that would not only continue to impoverish the Cuban
people, but set a bad example for other emerging free-market democracies
in Latin America.
<P>
<B>CUBA AND U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY</B>
<P>
 While it is true that Castro no longer has the ability to export
violent communist revolution on a large scale throughout the Western
Hemisphere and Africa, he has not renounced the use of violence
to overthrow democratically-elected governments.  America's leaders
would do well to remember that one of the constant and enduring
characteristics of Fidel Castro's career has been his lifelong
hatred of the United States and everything it stands for in the
world.
<P>
 Some of ways in which Castro threatens U.S. national security
include the following:
<P>
 <B>* Castro continues to allow the operation by Russian intelligence
officials of an electronic listening post at Lourdes.</B>  The
Russians argue that the post is needed to monitor U.S. compliance
with its missile treaty obligations, yet American compliance is
not an issue between the U.S. and Russia.  In fact, Lourdes is
an intelligence gathering facility at the service of Russian spies.
<P>
 *<B> Russian nuclear missiles may not be targeted at America
from Cuban soil, but Castro is determined to complete -- with
Russian help -- construction of a $2 billion nuclear reactor only
240 miles South of Miami.</B>  This tropical white elephant could
easily become America's Chernobyl in the Caribbean.  According
to a 1992 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, there
is evidence of shoddy construction at the facility, including
bad welding, and the nuclear technology being used in the plant
is dangerously outdated.  A nuclear accident at the Juragua reactor
in Cuba could conceivably endanger millions of American lives
in the southeastern United States.
<P>
 *<B> If Castro is permitted to recapitalize his communist regime
with billions of dollars in Western aid, he could easily threaten
economic and democratic reforms throughout Latin America</B>.
 The region has achieved extraordinary progress in the past decade
toward economic and political reforms.  Prospects for sustained
economic development and democratic stability have never been
greater in Latin America and the Caribbean.  However, despite
the explosive growth in trade throughout the region, popular support
for  free-market policies is still shallow, and the political
institutions of Latin America's emerging democracies are fragile.
 In the wake of the Mexican crisis, Catholic Bishops and left-wing
political organizations throughout Latin America have redoubled
their calls for the restoration of statist policies to replace
free market policies with socialist policies.  In this uncertain
regional environment, allowing Castro back into the community
of civilized nations in the Western Hemisphere would be analogous
to inviting a fox into a chicken coop.  Without any doubt, Castro
would continue to press his personal war against the United States,
seeking at every turn to undermine vital U.S. interests in institutions
such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization
of American States.
<P>
 Because of Castro's hostility to the U.S., it would be foolish
to think that his favor could be bought with aid, investments
or other American help.    No one should expect that lifting the
embargo would produce a friendly or cooperative Fidel Castro.
  The Cuban dictator will take the money Americans and others
give him, but no one should expect him to embrace democracy, free
markets and the American way of life.   Even with the embargo
lifted, Castro's regime would likely remain very unfriendly to
the U.S. and its interests.   The benefits of taming Castro with
aid and investments, which would be few in any event, would be
far outweighed by the long-range trouble caused by the willful
perpetuation of an anti-American authoritarian regime in Cuba
more or less indefinitely.  The longer Castro's regime survives,
the more opportunities there will be for him to host and support
any guerrilla or subversive movement that may arise in Latin America
in the future.   
<P>
 
<P>
 * <B>Castro has not renounced his long-established policy of
promoting the spread of Marxist-socialist revolution throughout
the developing world</B>.  Although he no longer has the capability
to export troops and weaponry to conflicts in Africa and Latin
America, he still provides political support for extreme leftist
organizations bent on the violent overthrow of democratic regimes
in their countries.   
<P>
<B>&quot;NO&quot; TO LIFTING THE TRADE EMBARGO</B>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade embargo insist that it has never worked
in 32 years.  They argue that Castro has not been forced from
power, and that the United States is the only country in the world
that still refuses to trade with Castro. Critics of the trade
embargo also contend that it punishes the Cuban people unjustly,
and deprives U.S. companies of the opportunity to invest billions
of dollars in Cuba at a time when the entire world is beating
a path to Castro's door.
<P>
 
<P>
  However, these arguments are not convincing.  Consider the following
points:
<P>
 <B>*  In fact, the trade embargo has been effective.  </B>Arguing
otherwise ignores history.<B>  </B> Castro was able to resist
the trade embargo only because he was receiving over $5 billion
a year in subsidies from the Soviet Union.  This money allowed
Castro to finance the build-up of one of the world's most repressive
and murderous communist regimes, while disguising the utter collapse
of the Cuban economy caused by his failed Marxist revolution.
 Since the loss of this Soviet patronage in 1991, the economic
and human devastation Castro produced in Cuba has become increasingly
clear in Cuba and throughout the world.  The effectiveness of
the U.S. trade embargo can be measured by the increasing desperation
of Castro to force the American government to end the embargo.
 Another way of measuring the embargo's effectiveness is the growing
intensity with which Castro's security forces have been repressing
dissidents in Cuba. 
<P>
 The embargo is having an effect.  It is unrealistic to have expected
the embargo to bring down the Castro regime so long as the Soviet
Union existed.  It is realistic now to expect a possible collapse
of Castro's regime now that the Soviet Union has disappeared.
 To lift the embargo now, when its pressure is most felt, would
be a tactical mistake and a strategic blunder.
<P>
 <B>*  Cuba is not China</B>.   Some proponents of lifting the
embargo on Cuba argue that if a strategy of open engagement is
good enough for communist China, it should be good enough for
Cuba as well.  While it is true that expanding U.S. trade with
China in the past twenty years has contributed to the development
of a vigorous free market in China's coastal regions, and that
China's opening markets have become the seedbeds of its democratization,
the same cannot be said for Castro's Cuba.  China's free-market
reforms have been supported for a long time by the government
of China.  Private investment in China has been fueled to a great
extent by Chinese expatriates from all over the Pacific region,
including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan.  China's free markets
are being created by hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens
who are so numerous that it is beyond the capacity of the Chinese
government to control all of their activities.  It also should
be remembered that China has been opening up its markets since
the mid-1970s.  
<P>
 None of these conditions exist in Cuba.   The level of openness
in the Chinese economy is decades ahead of that in Cuba, which
remains a highly repressed economy.  
<P>
For example, property rights do not exist in Cuba.  The current
Cuban Constitution bans the ownership of private property, prohibits
free enterprise in Cuba, and does not allow the hiring of Cuban
workers by Cuban employers -- unless the employer happens to be
the Cuban state.  
<P>
 Moreover, unlike China, there are no expatriate Cubans willing
to invest any of their hard-earned savings in Cuba as long as
Fidel Castro stays in power.  The  reason for this is that Cuba's
expatriate community in the United States and in other countries
understand that Fidel Castro cannot be trusted, and that any foreign
investment in Cuba as long as Castro controls the island will
merely be used to strengthen his communist regime, and prolong
his tyrannical repression of the Cuban people.  
<P>
 <B>*  Castro is not committed to market reforms.</B>  This is
evident in the way the regime treats private property, foreign
investors, and its own workers. For example, all Cuban properties
and plants offered to foreign investors by Castro's regime were
previously confiscated without compensation from their legal owners,
whose numbers included both Cuban citizens and foreign investors.
 Castro is doing business with stolen property, and eventually
foreign investors who forget the rule of law in their quest for
profit will have to answer for their actions before a court of
law in a free Cuban nation.  
<P>
 Second, Cuba has only 11 million inhabitants with a current per
capita income of less than $10 a month in real prices.  They have
little hard cash with which to buy U.S. goods and services, and
the island's technologically obsolescent manufacturing facilities,
unlike those in China, produce little that U.S. consumers would
find appealing. 
<P>
 Third, foreign investors who do engage in business with Castro
do so only with Cuban &quot;investors&quot; approved by Castro's
communist regime.  Moreover,  Cuban workers employed by these
enterprises do not receive an income that reflects the full value
of their work in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies.  Instead,
their salaries are collected in hard currency by the state, and
paid out in Cuban pesos at the official rate of exchange of one
peso per dollar. Thus, these foreign investors are not only dealing
with stolen property, but are also exploiting Cuban workers for
the benefit of Castro's communist regime.
<P>
 Fourth, Castro has said repeatedly that he has no intentions
of allowing a free-market economy to flourish in Cuba.  He talks
instead of a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; in which the
state would remain the sole &quot;owner&quot; of all property
and economic activity in Cuba.  Castro's reluctant experimentation
with free food markets in recent months has been intended to ease
popular frustrations by making more food available to Cuban consumers--
food that Castro's collectivized, command-economy policies have
been incapable of producing for decades without billions of dollars
in Soviet subsidies.  In fact, Castro's control of the Cuban economy
is so great that, in recent months, the Cuban peso is believed
to have strengthened because the government has been engaging
in black market commerce to push down prices and build up the
peso.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
 The trade embargo against Cuba is the most effective weapon in
America's foreign policy arsenal for dealing with Fidel Castro.
 It matters not if other countries think the embargo should be
lifted and Castro re-admitted to the community of civilized nations.
 The U.S. has long conditioned the embargo's removal on Castro's
compliance with the following basic demands: (1) free and democratic
elections must be held in Cuba; (2) a free-market economy must
be allowed to develop, and the property and assets stolen from
their rightful owners must be returned to these owners, or else
compensation must be paid at fair market value; (3) all political
repression of dissidents must cease immediately, and all political
prisoners must be freed from jail; and (4) Castro must renounce
his stated goal of promoting global violent revolution, and step
down from power, allowing the Cuban people to exercise their legitimate
human rights to become a free people in a democratic society.
<P>
 These are noble and principled demands.  They are the philosophical
platform on which the trade embargo against Cuba has stood for
over three decades.  The world has changed in those three decades,
but today these principles have greater moral authority than ever
before.  America's leaders should not allow themselves to be fooled
by Castro's propaganda. The Cuban dictator may indeed be a toothless
tiger without his Soviet patrons, but he has not changed his stripes
at all.   America's leaders would do well to remember that old
and tiring tigers can be unpredictably dangerous.  Now is not
the time to ease up on Castro and snatch defeat from the jaws
of victory.  Instead, Congress and the Clinton Administration
would be wise to increase the pressure against Castro, and hasten
the day when Cuba at long last will be a free nation.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
For the first time since 1986, when the U.S.  started passing judgment on
the counternarcotics efforts of 29 major drug-producing and drug-transit
countries, Colombia this year received a failing grade.  However, on
February 28, President Clinton issued a "national interest waiver"
exempting it from this failing grade.  As a result, Colombia will be eligible
for continued U.S.  aid even though it is not doing enough to stop the illegal
drug trade.
<P>
     This policy is deeply misguided.  The threat to U.S.  and
hemispheric security posed by Colombia's narco-democracy cannot be
overestimated.  The U.S.  may be the world's largest consumer of drugs, but
Colombia ranks third in the world in per capita consumption.  Literally
every country in the Americas has a serious domestic drug crisis.  The drug
cartels are well-positioned to influence Latin America's economic reforms
and manipulate the region's weak political and judicial institutions.  In
Colombia, they have penetrated the regulatory and lawmaking processes to
the point that they can influence constitutional and financial reform.  They
also have been financing election campaigns for many years, and at least
three Colombian presidents have knowingly taken money from drug
traffickers.
<P>
          Congress should demand an explanation from the Clinton
Administration.  Why should the U.S.  provide aid to stop the drug trade
and support Colombia's economic development when Colombia's
government is not serious about ending the production and trafficking of
narcotics?  The Clinton Administration's counternarcotics policy clearly is
not working.  It should be reviewed with two objectives in mind:  to
establish tougher standards for Colombia and to increase pressure on the
Colombian government to eradicate the drug cartels.  Specifically, the U.S. 
should:
<P>
Decertify Colombia for its lack of cooperation with the U.S.  Decertification
would block Colombia's access to financial and technical aid from the
multilateral development banks and should trigger the suspension of all
counternarcotics aid to Colombia as well.  The U.S.  should not consider
granting even a "national interest" recertification until President Ernesto
Samper dispels, with actions instead of words, international perceptions that
he has been compromised by the Cali cartel.
<P>
Insist that Colombia sign an extradition treaty with the U.S.  This would
allow Colombian citizens under indictment in the U.S.  for drug trafficking,
money laundering, and other drug-related crimes to be extradited to the U.S.
<P>
Urge Colombia to sign a bilateral law enforcement treaty with the U.S. 
Colombia would agree to enact tough money-laundering and sentencing laws
for narcotics traffickers and to confiscate all commercial, real estate, and
personal assets owned by convicted traffickers. 
<P>
 Develop specific performance benchmarks for Colombia as a condition for
any renewed bilateral assistance.
<P>
Hold extensive congressional hearings to review Colombia's counter-drug
cooperation and performance.  These hearings should focus on narco-politics
and narco-corruption in both Colombia and Mexico, since drug cartels in
both countries are working together to flood the United States with drugs
and weapons. 
<P>
 Impose visa prohibitions on Colombian officials, regardless of rank, who
are implicated in narco-corruption or any drug-related offenses.
End Colombia's participation in the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA). 
This would mean that Colombian products would lose preferential tariff
access to U.S.  markets, potentially costing the Colombian economy
hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced export earnings.
<P>
THE WORLD'S FIRST NARCO-DEMOCRACY
<P>
     U.S.  counternarcotics experts believe that Colombia is the world's
first narco-democracy, a country whose economy, political system, and
society have been profoundly compromised and distorted by the wealth and
power of the drug cartels.  Former President Misael Pastrana, who governed
Colombia from 1974-1978, asserts:  "El Tiempo [Bogota's leading daily
newspaper] talks about a 'narco-project.'  People talk about 'narco-crimes,'
they talk about 'narco-money,' and if you add that up, logically it implies
general contamination." 
<P>
           Joe Toft, former head of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) in Bogota, claims that Colombia is "already at the abyss."  Narco-
democracy "really is here [in Colombia]," he said during a live interview
with Colombian television.  "I can't think of a single institution in Colombia
that I know of, with any judicial, legal or political influence, which does not
have problems of penetration by the narcotics traffickers.  The Attorney
General's office has serious problems.  Congress is also very infiltrated by
narco-traffickers.... Everything favors [the] Cali [drug cartel].  They got rid
of extradition, which was the only thing they truly feared.  And now the
situation is very favorable [for the drug kingpins]."
<P>
          Colombian drug traffickers repatriate between $3 billion and
$7 billion a year in laundered drug-related earnings from the United States
and Europe, according to U.S.  counter-drug analysts.  Drug money has
created a construction frenzy in Colombia's main cities -- Bogota, Medellin,
Cali, and Barranquilla -- and has pushed up the prices of land and housing
drastically.  In a country where the minimum wage is 31 cents an hour,
four-bedroom apartments are selling for up to $400,000 in cash.  U.S.  and
government authorities have evidence that drug proceeds have been
deposited in every major bank in Colombia.
<P>
          Every resident of Cali or Medellin is affected directly or
indirectly by drug-tainted money.  For example, a $10 million deposit of
drug money in a Cali or Medellin bank may be loaned out to build a new
apartment complex.  This money eventually trickles down to the local
economy for the purchase of everyday goods and services.  Drug trafficking
proceeds have been a primary source of revenue for the cities of Cali and
Medellin since the mid-1980s, and more recently for Barranquilla, according
to U.S.  anti-drug analysts.
<P>
          The DEA believes that "the revenue generated by the influx
of drug proceeds into the economy has provided the Colombian Government
with funds for debt payments and national infrastructure development....
[T]hrough the purchase of government-issued securities, Colombian drug
kingpins are investing in their country's future development.  The immense
resources of the drug cartels afford them a cushion of security in Colombia. 
Their influence within the banking industry, government, and law
enforcement agencies already has impeded attempts to prosecute them. 
Through bribery and intimidation, they have altered and reversed undesired
policy decisions by the country's government and banking regulators."
<P>
          The Colombian drug cartels have expanded their operations
around the world significantly since the early 1990s.  U.S.  counternarcotics
intelligence agencies have identified at least 14 "core" Colombian cartels in
business with 19 Mexican cartels to transport Colombian-produced cocaine
and heroin into the United States.  Since the 1980s, the Colombian cartels
have opened new consumer markets for cocaine in practically every Latin
American country.  Venezuela has become a major drug-transit country;
Panama retains its historical position as a key drug-transit and money-
laundering country; and Guatemala has emerged as an important
"warehousing" country, used by Colombian and Mexican cartels running
loosely integrated drug trafficking operations.
<P>
          In Europe, the Colombian drug barons are doing business
with the Sicilian Mafia and other criminal groups in Italy, Germany, France,
and Britain.  They also are penetrating Eastern Europe and opening new
markets in Russia in association with Russia's thriving criminal underworld. 
Although the production and international distribution of cocaine and heroin
is their primary business, Colombian cartels also trade in weapons, icons,
raw materials, radioactive materials, and counterfeit U.S.  dollars.
<P>
          The Official Position. The Colombian government and many
Colombians express outrage at the word "narco-democracy," rejecting the
argument that drug cartels have thoroughly penetrated every aspect of
Colombian society.  The official government line on the Colombian drug
problem is that the drug traffickers comprise a very small minority and that
Colombians have battled the drug traffickers much longer, and have died in
far greater numbers, than anyone else.  The drug problem is described by
the Colombian government as an international issue that requires
international solutions. 
<P>
           But Colombians tend to overlook the global reach and power
of their country's drug cartels.  Colombia's five-year-old constitution bans
the extradition of Colombian citizens wanted for crimes committed in other
countries, and the courts rarely punish drug traffickers.  In fact, 38 percent
of the drug traffickers who turn themselves in through the plea bargain
system never spend a single day in jail, and not one major trafficker has
been jailed in more than a year. 
<P>
           The Samper Administration's response to President Clinton's
decision to downgrade Colombia with a "national interest" certification was
a mixture of rejection and defiance.  Officials close to Samper suggested
that Colombia might choose to reject all future U.S.  assistance in the
counternarcotics war rather than subject their country to a review by the
U.S.  government which many Colombians consider to be both unfair and
biased against them.
<P>
          The Samper Administration's view was summed up in its
official response to the DEA's report on the impact of money laundering in
the Colombian economy.  In this document, the Samper government
defended Colombia's financial controls as adequate, denied that drug
traffickers have a significant impact on the Colombian economy, and
charged that the DEA is opposed to a free-market economy with a strong
and vigorous private sector:  "The document circulated by the DEA shows
profound ignorance on how the Colombian economy operates.... Due to its
lack of methodology or scientific accuracy and to its bias against the
country, the [DEA] document constitutes not only an insult to Colombians,
but an insult to intelligence."
<P>
PRESSURING COLOMBIA TO GET TOUGH ON DRUGS
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's current counternarcotics policy is not
working in the case of Colombia.  Something must be done to stem the flow
of drugs from the world's most powerful cocaine cartels.  The U.S.  should
consider every possible avenue for compelling the Colombian government
to crack down on these criminal cartels.  The staff report issued on February
27, 1995, by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations calls for stronger
oversight of Colombia's counternarcotics performance and decertification of
Colombia for its failure to combat the illegal drug trade.  This approach
should be welcomed.  Specifically, the U.S.  should:
<P>
Decertify Colombia for its lack of cooperation with the U.S.  Decertification
would block Colombia's access to financial and technical aid from
multilateral development banks such as the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and World Bank.  All U.S.  counternarcotics aid to Colombia
also should be suspended.  The U.S.  should not grant "national interest" re-
certification until the Samper Administration demonstrates with strong
actions its commitment to eliminating the drug cartels.  Thus, President
Samper not only must increase the volume of cocaine and heroin seizures
in Colombia, but also must dismantle the Cali cartel and prosecute all of its
leaders, including the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Ivan Urdinola, Jose
Santacruz Londono, and Pacho Herrera.  A credible plan for attacking the
cocaine and heroin traffic also should encompass an effective strategy for
reducing the coca and opium poppy crops by 10 percent annually and 50
percent within five years.  Until Colombia meets these conditions, the U.S. 
should withhold recertification.
<P>
Insist that Colombia sign an extradition treaty with the U.S.  This
would allow for the extradition of Colombian citizens under indictment
in the U.S.  for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other drug-
related crimes.  It would require Colombia's political leaders to amend
a five-year-old constitution which banned extradition in a deliberate
concession to the drug cartels.  Colombia's constitution and laws
should not be customized to accommodate the interests of these
criminals.
<P>
Urge Colombia to sign a bilateral law enforcement treaty with the U.S. 
In this treaty, Colombia would agree to enact tougher sentencing laws
for narcotics traffickers and to enforce other measures, such as
confiscation of all commercial, real estate, and other assets owned
directly or indirectly by convicted traffickers.  Dangerous traffickers
believed responsible for dozens of murders now are jailed for only a few
years or even months, and the Colombian government makes no effort
to confiscate their assets and properties.
<P>
Develop specific performance benchmarks for Colombia as a condition
for any renewed bilateral assistance.  These benchmarks should take the
form of specific targets or quotas relating to the eradication of coca and
opium poppy crops, the seizure of cocaine and heroin shipments, the
destruction of precursor chemicals and processing labs, and the capture
of anyone identified in Colombia, the U.S., or anywhere else in the
world as a drug trafficker or money launderer.  Because Colombia is
a "core" drug producing country and the headquarters of the world's
cocaine industry, it should be subject to standards appreciably tougher
than those applied to other countries.
<P>
Hold extensive congressional hearings to review Colombia's counter-
drug cooperation and performance.  These hearings should focus on
narco-trafficking, narco-corruption, and narco-politics in both Colombia
and Mexico.  U.S.  counternarcotics officials believe that President
Samper's election campaign was partly financed with Cali cartel money
and that Samper has been accepting money from the Medellin and Cali
cartels, either for himself or for other presidential candidates in whose
campaigns he has worked, at least since 1982.  When the DEA ran the
names of Colombia's 263-member Congress into Naddis (the DEA's
computerized list of suspects), more than a fourth showed up on the
list.  While that alone may not prove guilt, it does indicate that DEA
informants and others have linked these people to drug cases.  Seven of
Colombia's 32 governors also appeared on the list. 
<P>
      As Congress examines Colombia's role in the drug trade, it also
should take a hard look at Mexico.  A total of 33 "core" Colombian and
Mexican cartels are working together to produce cocaine and heroin in
Colombia.  They transport these drugs by air and sea, and overland
through Central America.  The drugs are warehoused in Guatemala
with the connivance of corrupt members of the Guatemalan armed
forces.  From Guatemala, the drugs are shipped across Mexico to U.S. 
border crossing points in California, Arizona, and Texas.
<P>
     Mexico plays an increasing role in the Western Hemisphere's
cocaine trade.  Yet, the U.S.  has no extradition treaty with Mexico, and
corruption within Mexican law enforcement agencies is endemic.  More
than 80 percent of the drug gangs in Texas come from Mexico, and
street gangs in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston are supplied by
Mexican cartels.  Throughout the Southwest U.S., Mexican drug
gangs, most of whom are in the U.S.  illegally, operate significant drug
trafficking operations and provide street gangs with drugs and guns,
thereby increasing the level of violent crime in many American cities.
<P>
Impose visa prohibitions on Colombian officials, regardless of rank, who
are implicated in narco-corruption or any drug-related offenses.  These
should include any suspected member of the Colombian executive,
judiciary, and Congress, plus all members of their immediate families,
until such time as an investigation deemed satisfactory by the U.S. 
establishes their guilt or innocence.
<P>
End Colombia's participation in the Andean Trade Preferences Act
(ATPA).  The ATPA was enacted by the U.S.  government to help drug-
producing and drug-transit countries in the Andean region reduce
the production and trafficking of narcotics and to promote the
cultivation of legal agricultural products and other goods by reducing
U.S.  tariffs on imports from these countries.  ATPA was meant to be
a quid pro quo for effective efforts to curb drug trafficking.  Moreover,
two key conditions for inclusion in ATPA are signing an extradition
treaty with the U.S.  and achieving quantitative progress in reducing
illegal drug production and trafficking.  However, Colombia's five-year-
old constitution specifically bans the extradition of Colombian citizens
to other countries, and President Clinton's use of a "national interest
waiver" to recertify Colombia clearly proves that Colombia is not
meeting the requirements of U.S.  law for inclusion in the ATPA. 
Colombia's preferential access to U.S.  markets under ATPA should be
suspended immediately because Colombia does not meet its key
conditions.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     By any standard, Colombia is no longer a reliable ally in the U.S. 
war on drugs.  The time has come to begin treating the Colombian
government as part of the American drug problem rather than part of the
solution.  Recognizing this with presidential decertification is an important
first step.  This will help to prevent Colombia from obtaining assistance
from multilateral financial institutions, which in effect are helping to
subsidize the production of Colombia's poisonous narcotics exports.
<P>
          Beyond this, the U.S.  should take the lead in isolating
Colombia internationally.  This will involve denying visas to known drug
operatives in the Colombian government and even withdrawing trade
preferences for Colombian exports as permitted by the Andean Trade
Preferences Act (ATPA).  While trade is a blunt and usually
inappropriate tool for governments, in this case it will send the clear signal
that Colombia no longer deserves the preferential treatment provided by the
ATPA.
<P>
     Finally, the Clinton Administration must reaffirm its commitment to
the war on drugs, which had begun to show substantial progress by 1992.
Unfortunately, most of the earlier gains have been reversed because of
President Clinton's benign neglect of the problem. Colombia's national
interest recertification is only the most recent example of this. Although
much ridiculed as an insufficient response at the time, the Reagan
Administration's "Just Say No" effort was more successful than many want
to admit. It is time to just say no to Colombia.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union,
there has been a growing chorus of cries for the United States to lift the
economic embargo on Cuba. This chorus has included even such responsible
anti-communist voices as those of former President Richard Nixon and the
editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. Such calls are curious, coming as
they are just when it appears that the 32-year-old embargo may be bearing
fruit. Five years after losing the financial patronage of the former Soviet
Union, Fidel Castro's communist regime is facing severe shortages and
growing popular discontent. Cuba's economy has shrunk by more than half
since 1989, the black market is more dynamic than the formal command
economy controlled by the state, and Fidel Castro's efforts to build a huge
tourism industry and attract billions of dollars in new foreign investments
have proved dismal failures.
<P>
     This economic collapse has imperiled the stability of the Castro
regime. The Soviet Union's demise robbed Castro of his ideological base
and about $4.5 billion a year in direct subsidies, exposing the complete
failure of the communist revolution to improve the lives of the Cuban
people. Moreover, as the economy's collapse has accelerated, popular
discontent has increased to levels that threaten the survival of the regime.
That was made clear in August, when thousands of Cubans rioted in
Havana's Old Waterfront district, and by the subsequent flight to sea of
more than 30,000 Cubans of all ages. Another indication that Castro's grip
on power is slipping is the increased repression of organized dissident
groups by Cuban security forces.
<P>
     While the embargo may finally be working, Castro remains defiant.
He refuses to allow true free-market reforms and rejects democratic political
reforms. Instead, he is conducting an aggressive international campaign to
get the embargo lifted without making any economic or political concessions
in return. Castro is trying to force the United States to lift the embargo in
order to resuscitate his dying communist regime with billions of dollars in
trade, investment, and international aid.
<P>
     Although the United States today stands virtually alone in its
insistence on maintaining the embargo, it must stand firm. Thus far, the
Clinton Administration has resisted pressure to lift the embargo. To hasten
the transition to a post-Castro Cuba, the Administration should:
Maintain the embargo until irreversible economic and political reforms
leading to democratic capitalism take place.
<P>
Admit no more Cuban refugees into the U.S. beyond the 20,000 per year
agreed to during negotiations in September. The 32,000 Cuban refugees now
at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo and in Panama should gradually be
processed for admission to the United States.
<P>
Demand that U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico and
Canada, stop coddling Castro and start calling for real change.
Link future free trade agreements between the United States and Latin
American/Caribbean nations to redoubled efforts by these countries to
persuade Castro to liberalize Cuba's economy and political system.
Prepare for the possibility that Castro's collapse could unleash a lengthy
period of social and political unrest, and perhaps even civil war, in Cuba.
Reinforce the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in anticipation of attack by
pro-Castro forces.
<P>
Provide financial and other support to more than 150 dissident groups within
Cuba that are struggling to bring down Castro.
Increase the broadcasting activities of Radio Mart.
<P>

THE CUBAN CRISIS
<P>
     Cuba today is suffering its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro
seized power in 1959. The island's gross social product (equivalent to gross
domestic product) has plunged nearly 60 percent, including this year's
projected contraction of 5 percent. Power blackouts occur daily in Havana
and other major cities. Over two-thirds of the island's industrial facilities are
shut down almost permanently due to a lack of raw materials. Gasoline is
very scarce, and automotive transportation is at a virtual standstill. Animal
power is used for heavy agricultural activities, and most Cubans get about
on bicycles or on foot. Over half of Cuba's work force is now unemployed,
although unemployment officially remains a crime punishable by
imprisonment.
<P>
     Since July 1993, when the Castro regime authorized the use of U.S.
dollars, Cuba's own currency has become worthless. Although the official
exchange rate between the peso and the U.S. dollar is one-to-one, the black
market rate in August was 130 pesos to the dollar. No one will work for
pesos, since the minimum wage is now equivalent to about three dollars a
month. Productivity has dropped 45 percent since 1990, according to Cuban
economists, and many state employees no longer bother to go to work.
Instead, they have joined the fast-swelling ranks of self-employed or black
market workers whose economic activities are marked by the struggle to
survive from one day to the next without earning too much income lest they
be charged with illegal enrichment and jailed.
<P>
     Many Cuban women have turned to prostitution in a desperate effort
to feed their children and families, since government rationing provides only
half of the average family's monthly nutrition needs. In May, Cuba's
minimum wage would buy "only a two-pound chicken, or a pound of pork,
or four liters of milk in unofficial markets." Many Cuban families now
survive on one daily meal consisting of rice, beans, soy, and water. For
months, Cubans have been deprived even of bath soap. Infectious diseases
once thought to be eradicated, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are
returning as Cuba's free health care system collapses. Hospitals lack even
the most basic supplies such as bandages and surgical thread for sutures.
There are not enough pencils and ruled paper to supply the country's school
system.
<P>
     Although some Cuban economists said the economy would "hit
bottom" in 1994, the poor performance of the critical sugar industry
indicates that the crisis actually will grow substantially worse during 1995.
Sugar production has dropped from an estimated 8.1 million metric tons in
1989 to barely 4.2 million metric tons last year. This year's crop will be
even lower; one reliable estimate forecasts 4 million metric tons for 1994
and 3.5 million metric tons for 1995.
<P>
     Before Castro took power in 1959, Cuba ranked third in per capita
income in Latin America, behind only Argentina and Venezuela. Today,
after 35 years of socialism and more than $75 billion in Soviet economic
and military aid, Cuba's per capita income is one of the lowest in the
Western Hemisphere, possibly even approaching the levels of such countries
as Haiti.[It is difficult to measure GSP per capita with any accuracy for
several reasons, including the broad differential between the official and
black market exchange rates (the official rate is one peso to one U.S. 
dollar, while the black market rate was 130 pesos to the dollar in August
1994); the fact that the black market or informal economy now accounts for
over half of Cuba's GSP, but its real dimensions are difficult to quantify;
and because none of the Cuban government's economic statistics are
considered reliable.  However, studies by independent economists such as
Dr.  Manuel Lasaga, director of the research and consulting firm Strategic
Information Analysis, Inc.  (StratInfo), confirm that the Cuban economy and
GSP per capita have plunged precipitously.  For example, in a May 1994
study on the Cuban economy, Dr.  Lasaga projected that GSP, measured in
1981 pesos, will contract 5.8 percent in 1994 to 13.77 billion pesos, which,
at the official exchange rate works out to a GSP per capita of US$ 1,252,
assuming a population of 11 million Cubans.  But measured at the August
1994 black market rate, GSP per capita would be an impossibly low US$
9.60.  The Heritage Foundation's forthcoming Index of Economic Freedom
uses an estimated GSP per capita of USD 750.]
<P>

The Embargo Didn't Cause Cuba's Misery 
<P>
     Fidel Castro blames the U.S. trade embargo for the collapse of the
Cuban economy. The truth, however, is that Cuba's economic destruction
was caused by the regime's ruinous economic policies. Specifically, Castro's
command economy, based on a 1976 constitution and laws which prohibit
private enterprise and ownership of property, completely destroyed the free
market in Cuba, hindering economic growth and prosperity.
<P>
     The United States first imposed a trade embargo on Cuba on
February 3, 1962, in response to Castro's confiscation of privately owned
properties and other productive assets, as well as his aggressive support for
violent communist revolution throughout the Western Hemisphere. The
original goals of the embargo were to compel Castro to open Cuba's
economy and establish democracy, to weaken Cuba's communist regime,
and to force Castro to relinquish power. From the beginning, however, many
industrialized countries have refused to cooperate with U.S. policy towards
communist Cuba and have continued to maintain diplomatic and trade
relations with the dictatorship. This includes such important U.S. partners
as Canada and Mexico.
<P>
     Soviet patronage and subsidies in excess of $4.5 billion a year
enabled Castro to resist the U.S. trade embargo until 1989, all the while
claiming a fictitious "success" for his Marxist revolution and building one
of the most repressive and murderous regimes in the annals of communist
totalitarianism. At least 13,000 Cuban citizens have been executed since
1959, and over 100,000 have been jailed for opposing the Castro regime,
including at least 28,000 still in prison today.
<P>
     The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived Castro not only of billions
of dollars in yearly subsidies, but also of the ideological bases which had
sustained his totalitarian regime ever since he came to power in 1959. Even
before the Soviet Union fell apart, however, Cuba's lengthy economic
decline already was accelerating. In 1989, Cuba reported a trade deficit of
$2.73 billion on exports of $5.39 billion and imports of $8.12 billion. By
1993, the trade deficit had dropped to an estimated $310 million, but exports
had fallen by over 70 percent to $1.53 billion while imports had contracted
nearly 80 percent to $1.84 billion. Moscow's refusal in 1990 to sign a new
five-year trade agreement with Cuba marked the end of the special
relationship between the two nations which had sustained Castro's tyranny
for thirty years.
<P>
     When Castro lost his Soviet support, many analysts forecast the swift
collapse of his dictatorship. In November of 1991, for example, Cuba
specialists at the Soviet Academy of Sciences predicted that the cutoff in
Soviet economic assistance would "fully paralyze" the Cuban economy
within a year. Yet Castro has survived. His endurance in the face of
economic devastation and resulting political instability has been aided by the
fact that Cuba's population totals about 11 million. This relatively small
population -- roughly similar to Ecuador's and about half the size of
Venezuela's -- has made it easier for the regime to use repressive measures
to contain the spread of dissident groups. At the same time, it has made it
easier for Castro to absorb the impact of the loss of Cuba's Soviet
patronage. Three years after the Soviet Union's collapse, however, Castro
is running out of time.
<P>
     Castro's Determination to Retain Power. Nevertheless, Castro
flatly rules out any possibility of compromise and reconciliation. In a
lengthy interview published September 25, 1994, by the Venezuelan daily
El Nacional, Castro repeated his oft-expressed demand that the U.S. lift the
embargo unilaterally without demanding any concessions in return.
Alternating between defiance and self-pity, Castro said:

    <UL> The U.S. plan is to starve Cuba into submission, but even if
     [the U.S.] were to hurl an atomic bomb at Cuba, nothing
     would change. There is no solution but to end the embargo....
     If [Cuba] had Venezuela's oil and other economic resources,
     we wouldn't even have developed tourism.... Lifting the
     embargo is fundamental.... The embargo is causing us terrible
     damage today when the socialist bloc no longer exists and we
     have lost 70 percent of our trade and imports.... What country
     in the world would have resisted the five years that Cuba has
     resisted?...  The suffering hurts all of us, but we won't
     exchange the independence of this nation for a plate of
     beans.... [U]nder no concept can lifting the embargo be
     conditioned to issues that affect our independence. The
     Cuban position is a worthy one: Lift the embargo without
     any conditions. It's the only honorable course.</UL>
     
     <P>
     

Growing Signs of Trouble 
<P>
     Cuba's economic collapse has accelerated in 1994, and social unrest
has increased dramatically. On July 13, at least 30 Cubans trying to flee the
island on a hijacked tugboat drowned at sea when four Cuban government
ships swept the decks of the fleeing tugboat with high-pressure water hoses
and rammed the aged wooden vessel until it broke up and sank. Of the 72
people believed to be aboard, only half survived. Over a ten-day period
between the last week of July and the first week of August, three passenger
ferries were hijacked in Havana harbor by Cubans desperate to flee their
country. On August 5, thousands of Cubans rioted in the Old Waterfront
district of Havana, throwing rocks at police and trashing dollar-only stores
after the police dispersed a crowd drawn to the harbor by rumors that boats
were waiting to carry them to freedom in the United States. At one point,
hundreds of Cubans tried to board Chinese and Canadian freighters in the
port. The rioting, which lasted over four hours and involved up to 15,000
people, was the worst Cuba has experienced in more than three decades.
<P>
     Castro responded predictably by blaming the riots on the U.S.
embargo and threatening to permit the wholesale flight of Cubans from the
island unless the embargo was lifted. A week after the August 5 riots, he
ordered his security forces to halt all activities aimed at preventing the
departure from Cuba of anyone wishing to leave. This decision triggered the
flight over a one-month period of tens of thousands of Cubans who set sail
in rickety home-built rafts in a desperate attempt to reach the U.S. Dozens
of U.S. Coast Guard and Navy ships were sent to the Florida Straits, where
over 32,000 refugees were rescued and transported to the U.S. military base
at Guantanamo on the southeastern tip of Cuba.
<P>

A New U.S. Policy 
<P>
     In response to the refugee crisis, the Clinton Administration tightened
economic sanctions on Cuba and sought negotiations with the Castro regime
to end the flight of refugees. On August 19, President Clinton announced
that Cuban refugees would not be permitted unrestricted access to the United
States, reversing a 28-year-old U.S. immigration policy. Previously, all
Cuban refugees that reached U.S. shores or were rescued at sea by the U.S.
Coast Guard were granted political asylum and permanent resident status
one year after entry into the U.S. under the provisions of the 1966 Cuban
Adjustment Act.
<P>
     On August 23, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno also announced
that Cuban citizens fleeing the island illegally would be denied the
opportunity to apply for political asylum in the United States. In addition,
the Clinton Administration turned up the heat by banning some $400 million
a year in cash transfers by Cuban-Americans to their relatives in Cuba, by
cutting back U.S. charter flights to Cuba, and by increasing Radio Mart and
TV Mart broadcasts to Cuba.
<P>
     Following a week of negotiations in New York City, U.S. and Cuban
officials announced on September 9 that an agreement had been reached to
end the refugee crisis. The Castro regime agreed to prevent any more
refugees from setting out to sea, while the United States agreed to increase
the number of visas issued annually to Cubans to at least 20,000. Although
Castro had insisted that any talks with the United states must deal with the
embargo, the agreement was limited to immigration. U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher left open the possibility that future talks could be
expanded to other issues if the Castro regime agrees to comply with
longstanding U.S. demands for economic and democratic reforms in Cuba.
"If [Cuba] take[s] steps toward democracy, if they take steps toward the free
market, if they take steps to ease the human rights situation, the United
States will respond in a carefully calibrated way," said Christopher.

<P>
A GROWING MOVEMENT TO LIFT THE EMBARGO 
<P>
     The Secretary of State's remarks were not an isolated development.
They reflected growing sentiment among many U.S. policymakers, and
Americans in general, who favor lifting the trade embargo on Cuba. Now
that the Cold War is over, many Americans appear to believe that the time
has come for the United States to remove the embargo against Cuba
unilaterally without demanding any political or economic concessions from
Fidel Castro. For example, former President Jimmy Carter has noted that
"It's time for [the United States] to begin discussions on how we can
alleviate this embargo which has caused tremendous suffering among the
people of Cuba and has distorted this hemisphere's concept of freedom and
democracy."
<P>
     The list of those who favor lifting the embargo goes beyond the
United States, though. NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada, two of Cuba's
largest trading partners, also are among the most forceful proponents of
ending the embargo. Practically every country in Latin America and the
Caribbean wants it lifted. Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and
Russia openly oppose it. In October, the U.N. General Assembly, for the
third consecutive year, passed a non-binding resolution calling on
Washington to end the embargo. Among the 184 delegations at the U.N.,
only Israel backed the United States, where a growing chorus of liberals and
conservatives, ranging from Jesse Jackson to William F. Buckley and The
Wall Street Journal, also are saying that it is time to end the embargo.
<P>

"Exporting Capitalism": The Comparison with China
<P>
     Those who favor lifting the embargo often point to the examples of
Vietnam and China to justify their position, claiming that eliminating the
embargo will encourage the growth of a free-market economy which will
undermine the communist regime. Such comparisons are not valid.
Capitalism is destroying communism in China, but the driving force is not
international trade. It is a strong domestic market economy tolerated by the
communist government. China's market economy is dominated by many
millions of small entrepreneurs who are devouring the communist command
economy. Moreover, China's market economy has been growing in depth
and diversity since the mid-1980s. Free trade is promoting faster market
growth and expanding the personal freedom of millions of Chinese,
encouraged by entrepreneurs and investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
elsewhere who are providing the capital, entrepreneurial skills, and
international trade contacts which are compelling China to transform its
economy. In the process, a vast and prosperous middle class is being
created.
<P>
     In Cuba, however, the Castro regime is not willing to liberalize the
economy and create a free market. Cuban exile communities in the United
States, Latin America, and Europe are not willing to work with Castro, and
market initiatives by the Castro regime to encourage them to do so are very
recent, dating from 1993 for the most part. The basic orientation of the
hard-liners surrounding Castro is to contain and restrict all initiatives that
unleash individual entrepreneurship and creativity. For example, the
government has arrested people for earning "too much" money in the
dollarized informal economy, the variety of legally permitted "family
businesses" has been restricted, and tax rates on the income of self-
employed Cubans have been increased. Moreover, Cuba's constitution and
legislation specifically prohibit all private initiative, notwithstanding recent
reforms allowing self-employment by Cubans in approximately 140
categories of economic activity from which all professionals (the core of any
middle class) are expressly barred. For over three decades, the regime has
operated on the basis of divide and rule. Castro's bitter enmity toward the
Cuban exile community precludes the possibility of replicating in the
Caribbean what China's exile community has accomplished in China.
<P>
     None of the alleged "market reforms" undertaken to date in Cuba are
true free-market initiatives. Free enterprise remains highly restricted. Foreign
investors doing business in Cuba today deal mainly with Castro's regime.
Cuban partners in joint ventures and mixed companies are approved by
Castro as "safe." Moreover, unlike China, Cuba has barely started to open
up its economy, and what little has been done to date has been permitted
with great official reluctance and with the objective of assuring the
communist government's political survival. China's economic transformation
has been under way since 1978, when important agricultural reforms were
introduced, including the right of peasant farmers to grow the crops they
wished and retain some of their profit. Moreover, the government of China
has encouraged the marketization of the country's coastal provinces, and
since 1992 the Chinese constitution has incorporated the concept of the
"socialist market economy." Although China remains a communist nation
where political freedoms are sharply restricted, the ruling regime has
permitted vigorous development of the private sector, thus laying the seeds
for its eventual demise and potential replacement by a politically pluralist,
more open society.
<P>
     The Myth of Lost Opportunities for Americans. Many of those
wishing to see the embargo lifted also argue that American businesses will
lose out to competition from other countries whose governments do not
restrict trade and investment in Cuba. But this argument is weak. Before the
communist revolution, the United States was Cuba's largest trading partner:
nearly 80 percent of Cuba's two-way volume of trade involved the U.S.
Regardless of when the embargo is lifted, the United States will quickly
regain its prominent role in the Cuban economy. Moreover, the Cuban-
American community, totaling over 1.8 million people, will be an important
source of investment capital and management experience.
<P>

CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR CHANGE IN CUBA
<P>
     Castro's recent comments and actions make it clear how fruitless it
would be for the United States to make concessions now. Even without
access to U.S. markets and investments, there are many steps Castro could
take to improve economic and political conditions within his country, but he
refuses to do so. These include:
<P>
Adopting free-market policies that include a reform of Cuba's constitution
and passage of laws to abolish all legal prohibition of private enterprise and
property ownership.
<P>
Holding democratic elections in the context of a politically pluralist society
in which the Communist Party is compelled to compete with democratic
organizations and political parties.
<P>
Freeing all political prisoners currently in Cuban jails.
<P>
Disbanding the Interior Ministry's security police and the Committees for
the Defense of the Revolution, which function as thought-control police and
as spies in every neighborhood in Cuba.
<P>
Eliminating the Marxist political indoctrination, which is a central feature
of Cuba's education system.
<P>
Restoring all confiscated assets and properties to their rightful owners, or
agreeing to pay appropriate compensation for what the regime has stolen
from them.
<P>
     Without these steps, lifting the embargo would only assure Castro's
continuing repression of the Cuban people. Those who advocate doing so
are violating their own professed commitment to hemispheric democracy and
the individual's right to self-determination. Castro is a ruthless, charismatic
dictator and is a potential danger to all democratic, freedom-loving nations.
He is an anachronism, but a dangerous one. The embargo, however, is not
an anachronism; it is a legitimate instrument for achieving the goal of a free
and democratic Cuba.
<P>
     Thus far, the Clinton Administration has been steadfast in refusing
to discuss the economic embargo. It is correct in doing so. To hasten the
collapse of the Castro regime and communism in Cuba, the Administration
should also:
<P>
Maintain the embargo until irreversible economic and political reforms
leading to democratic capitalism are in place. Tightening the economic
screws may lead to more disturbances and riots, as well as increased
repression as Castro struggles to remain in power. However, the embargo
remains the only effective instrument available to the U.S. government in
trying to force the economic and democratic concessions it has been
demanding of Castro for over three decades. Maintaining the embargo will
help to end the Castro regime more quickly.
<P>
Admit no more Cuban refugees into the U.S. beyond the 20,000 per year
agreed to during negotiations in September. Allowing the unrestricted entry
of Cuban refugees during the Cold War was valid and necessary while
Castro's regime was still powerful and its political control of the island was
undisputed. But circumstances have changed in the past five years, as the
Clinton Administration realized when it changed U.S. policy toward Cuba
during the August refugee crisis. Continuing to allow Cuban refugees
unrestricted entry to the United States serves only to prolong Castro's rule
by providing him a much-needed safety valve to relieve the pressure of
growing social discontent.
<P>
     However, the 24,000 refugees now at the U.S. Naval Base at
Guantanamo and the 8,000 more in Panama should be processed for
admission to the United States as soon as possible. The near-concentration
camp conditions in which they are being kept are unsustainable, and the cost
of maintaining them is high. The Clinton Administration agreed in
September to process and admit up to 20,000 Cubans a year. To clear out
the bases in Guantanamo and Panama, the Administration may be able to
process the refugees there for early admission but reduce the total number
of refugees admitted in the next three to five years by a proportional
number.
<P>
     The Cuban people must understand that it is up to them to solve the
social, economic, and political crisis caused by the Castro regime. U.S.
taxpayers should no longer be compelled to finance the costs of Castro's
unremitting tyranny. The Cuban people have the power to determine their
own government. The energy and courage invested in braving the shark-
filled Florida Straits would be spent better in Cuba, working to bring down
Castro.
<P>
Demand that U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico and
Canada, stop coddling Castro and start calling for real changes. The Clinton
Administration was successful in getting the United Nations to condemn the
military regime in Haiti. There is no reason it cannot exert equally
persuasive diplomatic pressure to get similar resolutions regarding Cuba
through that body. The Administration should strive to convince the
international community not to do business with Cuba until the jails are
emptied of all political prisoners, until Castro's repressive security forces are
disbanded, all illegally confiscated properties and assets are returned to their
rightful owners or appropriate compensation is paid, the constitution and
laws of Cuba are reformed to legalize free enterprise and private ownership
of property, free-market policies are adopted, and democratic elections are
held in a pluralist political context which allows the Cuban people to elect
the leaders they choose.
<P>
Link future free trade agreements between the United States and Latin
American/Caribbean nations to redoubled efforts by these countries to
persuade Castro to liberalize Cuba's economy and political system. In recent
years, many of the region's elected leaders have tried unsuccessfully to
persuade Castro to open Cuba's economy and democratize its political
system. Castro has rejected all of these overtures while gaining the support
of these Latin American and Caribbean nations in pressuring the U.S. to lift
the embargo.
<P>
     At the same time, Castro's intransigence has not slowed efforts by
many of these countries, including NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada, to
expand trade relations with Cuba. In June 1994, Mexico surpassed Spain as
the largest foreign investor in Cuba when a Monterrey firm paid $1.5 billion
for a 49 percent stake in the state telephone company, Empresas
Telecomunicaciones de Cuba (ETEC).[The investment by Grupo Domos
forms part of an arrangement between the Cuban and Mexican governments,
brokered by Mexico's Export Bank (Bancomext), to swap $340 million in
Cuban debts for stakes in Cuban industries, including Varadero's Hotel
Tuxpan and the transfer of the island's largest cement plant to Cemex.  In
September 1994, Mexpetrol, a consortium of private Mexican oil companies
and state-owned Pemex, announced a $200 million joint venture with Cuba's
state oil company to operate the Cienfuegos refinery, one of three on the
island, which at full capacity can process 65,000 barrels a day of crude oil. 
Glassmaker Grupo Vitro, which owns U.S.  glassmaker Anchor Glass and
reported total world sales of $3.5 billion in 1993, also confirmed in
September that it may acquire a glass bottling plant in Cuba.  On September
13, 1994, UPI reported from Mexico City that Mexican construction,
transportation, and tourism firms "are poised to increase trade and
investment" in Cuba if the U.S.  lifts its trade embargo, with "much of the
increase in trade probably channelled through Miami."] Spain is Cuba's
second-largest trading partner, dominating the island's tourism industry, but
Canadian companies are aggressively courting Castro's regime, particularly
in the mining and energy sectors. The U.S. should use its leverage as the
most important trading nation in the hemisphere to correct this. For
example, the NAFTA trade relationship carries an implicit agreement with
the shared goal of building a trade zone in the Western Hemisphere based
on free markets and respect for democracy. Those principles apply to all
other countries in the Americas seeking closer trade relations with the U.S.
and U.S. investment to help develop their economies. The Clinton
Administration should not be timid in pressing its case in this regard.
Prepare for the possibility that Castro's collapse could unleash a lengthy
period of social and political unrest, and perhaps even civil war, in Cuba.
U.S. policy toward Castro long has idealized an outcome in which Cuba
makes a peaceful transition to a free-market democracy. With Castro's
collapse more likely in the near term than ever before, however, the U.S.
government does not appear to have a policy for dealing with the likelihood
that it will take place amid bloodshed, armed conflict, and chaos. A recent
Rand study argues that the Departments of Defense and State must conceive
such a strategy "according to three general tasks: Containment of the crisis,
with the aim of damage limitation for both the United States and Cuba.
Alleviation of the crisis, for the purpose of reducing human suffering among
refugees and noncombatants on the island. Resolution of the crisis,
unilaterally or multilaterally, by diplomatic or other nonmilitary means.... "
The study's most important conclusion is that the end of Castro's regime
could come at any time during the next 12 to 36 months, and that the U.S.
government should seek to develop flexible responses for Castro's demise,
depending on whether it takes place in a climate of violence or peaceful
transition. The Clinton Administration should prepare now for the transition
that could begin without significant warning.
<P>
Reinforce the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in anticipation of attack by
pro-Castro forces. The Clinton Administration should consider the possibility
that a desperate Castro might attempt to provoke a violent U.S. military
response which could galvanize Cuban support for the regime based on old
fears, nurtured for decades by Castro's propaganda machine, of "Yanqui"
imperialism and colonialism. In this context, Cuban refugees now at
Guantanamo should be admitted to the U.S. or transported to other safe
havens. Once that is done, the Administration should reinforce the base with
tactical aircraft and at least a brigade-sized combat unit capable of holding
off a surprise attack.
<P>
Provide financial and other support to more than 150 dissident groups
within Cuba that are struggling to bring down Castro. Such groups
include the Catholic Church, which is dedicated to peaceful change. No
support should be provided to dissident groups intent on triggering violent
change, for the United States must avoid inflaming anti-American sentiment
at all costs. Dissident groups dedicated to peaceful change will be the basis
on which a civil society will be created in a post-Castro Cuba, and their
growth should be encouraged and supported in much the same way the
Reagan Administration clandestinely supported Lech Walesa's Solidarity
labor movement in Poland after martial law was imposed in late 1981. Such
support would include financing of publications and income subsidies to
permit dissidents to support themselves and their families.
<P>
Increase the broadcasting activities of Radio Mart. These broadcasts should
urge the Cuban people to bring down Castro peacefully and should specify
that under no circumstances will the U.S. interfere militarily in Cuba's
domestic affairs. They should also stress that what the U.S. wants is a
stable, friendly relationship with a democratic, free-market Cuba and that the
U.S. is willing to negotiate with the Cuban government as long as Castro
implements the comprehensive political and economic reforms he needs to
revive his stalled economy.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
     The 32-year-old trade embargo against Cuba may finally be
producing its intended results of destabilizing the island's communist
government and weakening Fidel Castro's control of the Cuban people.
Castro has resisted change for over five years since losing the Soviet
Union's financial support, but his final collapse may be closer than ever
before. Nevertheless, he continues his visceral loathing of democracy and
the free market, all the while demanding the embargo be lifted without
condition. It seems clear that Castro believes his survival hinges on the
embargo's elimination.

     Paradoxically, just as Castro's communist government may be close
to falling, a chorus of voices in the U.S. has risen to call for the lifting of
the embargo. They cite several reasons: to ease the suffering of the Cuban
people, to capitalize on the trade and investment opportunities other
countries allegedly are enjoying in Cuba, and to establish the bases of a
free-market economy that in time will compel democratic reforms as well.
But the greatest beneficiary would be Fidel Castro, whose 35-year-old
communist dictatorship would be fortified overnight if he were allowed
access to the billions of dollars in financial aid from multilateral agencies,
credit guarantees, and investment that would start flowing into Cuba.
<P>
      The United States must not abandon the Cuban people by relaxing
or lifting the trade embargo against the communist regime. Instead, the U.S.
government must reject all pressures to ease the embargo until all of the
objectives for which it was imposed are achieved. Anything less would
constitute an unacceptable breach of faith with the Cuban people, who today
are among the very few people left in the world who still suffer the brutality
of a communist dictatorship.

     Everyone can draw a sigh of relief now that U.S. forces will not
be invading Haiti. The loss of American lives that would have resulted
from an invasion has been avoided. Nonetheless, for the first time in
80 years, large numbers of American troops are landing in Haiti.
Within several weeks, as many as 15,000 U.S. forces are expected to be
dispatched to that poor, chaotic nation. Thus, while an invasion of
Haiti has been avoided, an occupation has not. 
    <P>  And this is precisely Bill Clinton's -- and America's -- new
problem. The actual invasion of Haiti to reinstall Father Jean-
Bertrand Aristide to power was never the main reason for opposition to
Clinton's Haiti policy. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently
acknowledged that even an invasion that encountered resistance would
have taken no more than "a few hours." Rather, people were against the
invasion because of what would come afterward -- a U.S. occupation of
Haiti that they felt was unwise and unnecessary. Therefore, the
original cause of opposition to Clinton's policy remains. With U.S.
troops heading for Haiti, the easy part is over. Now the difficult
task of pacifying and "restoring" democracy begins. 
  <P>   Public Wary About Clinton Policy. Having assumed responsibility
for Haiti's future, the Clinton Administration still has not convinced
the American people that intervention in Haiti was necessary. Even
after a speech to the nation on September 15, in which the President
outlined his reasons for military action, more than 60 percent of
Americans polled were against the use of U.S. force. In fact, as the
hour of invasion drew closer, the more opposition to an invasion
mounted. New reports reveal that Clinton was desperate for Jimmy
Carter's peace mission to succeed. In the hours before the invasion
was to begin, the President apparently began to realize that military
action would be a big political mistake.
  <P>   But the President may face an even bigger political headache in
the future: managing the occupation of an extremely poor and divided
Third World country. Clinton has yet to outline a convincing "exit
strategy" for the U.S. -- to define clearly the conditions that must
be met in order to get the troops back home. Despite the President's
assurances that U.S. troops will return soon, the Clinton
Administration is underestimating the troubles U.S. forces will face
in Haiti. Bringing Aristide back to Port-au-Prince will be easy.
Keeping him there in power will not be.
  <P>   Many Unanswered Questions. The precise terms of the agreement
between the United States and the Haitian military junta are unclear.
According to the deal brokered by Jimmy Carter, by October 15, unless
the Haitian parliament has acted sooner to offer them political
reprieve, the junta must relinquish power to the elected government of
Aristide. This poses a number of intriguing questions, including:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>1)   To whom will the military and police forces owe their allegiance
     once their leaders have abdicated? Many of them were opponents of
     Aristide and his supporters. American peacekeepers may be left to
     contend with general lawlessness among thousands of armed forces
     whose leaders no longer control them. The U.S. troops will have
     to disarm these troops if they are to avoid becoming targets
     themselves. But the policy of disarming belligerents in Somalia
     failed, at the cost of more than three dozen American lives.
<P>
2)   What if General Raoul Cedras or other members of the junta refuse
     to leave Haiti once they step down from power? In the press
     conference after the deal was announced, Secretary of State
     Warren Christopher said that "there will be no incentive for [the
     generals] to stay in Haiti" after October 15. But nothing in the
     agreement prevents them from staying in Haiti. Moreover, Cedras
     and his allies represent the most well-organized and determined
     opposition to Aristide. If Cedras stays and decides to run for
     parliament this year or for president next year, U.S. forces may
     find themselves caught between two diametrically opposed
     political factions. It is not inconceivable that Aristide,
     emboldened by the U.S. presence, might incite his followers to
     the same type of mob tactics he used as president to intimidate
     political opponents. In August 1991, he encouraged his supporters
     to surround the parliament building to prevent members from
     voting a motion of no-confidence against his government.
<P>
3)   How long before Aristide turns on his American mentors? The
     Clinton Administration has been able to extract promises of good
     behavior from Aristide as long as he has been living comfortably
     in Washington, D.C. Once he is back in Port-au-Prince, however,
     he could revert to the anti-Americanism that had been the
     hallmark of his political career. For example, in an April 1990
     radio interview regarding U.S. support for the upcoming Haitian
     elections, Aristide claimed that "they [the Americans] want to
     hold our guts always in their hands. Thus, we will be
     economically, politically, and culturally dependent. For our
     part, we reject this.... "  If Aristide becomes unhappy with the
     United States -- if aid is not enough or if he thinks the U.S. is
     equivocating in its support for him personally -- this anti-
     Americanism is bound to resurface.
<P>
4)   What happens if Aristide decides not to step down at the end of
     his presidential term? In his September 15 address to the nation,
     President Clinton declared that "Aristide has pledged to step
     down when his term ends... [in 1996]." But that is a rather
     dramatic concession that may come as a surprise to Aristide's
     supporters in Haiti. Until now, Aristide has held firm to the
     belief that the period of his exile does not count as part of his
     five-year term in office. Will the U.S. blockade Haiti and impose
     economic sanctions if Aristide remains in office past 1996, in
     violation of the 1987 Haitian constitution?
<P>
5)   What happens when "democracy" fails to take root with Aristide's
     return? With the occupation of Haiti, the U.S. assumes
     responsibility for building "democracy" in a country where three-
     quarters of its presidents in nearly two centuries of
     independence have not completed their terms. The U.S. will soon
     be sending judicial, law enforcement, military, economic, and
     political advisors to help establish civil order there. Despite
     Clinton's claims to the contrary in his September 15 speech, this
     is nation-building pure and simple; it is a policy that failed
     miserably in Somalia last year with the unnecessary loss of some
     40 American lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     America's new venture into liberal colonialism has begun. The
U.S. is about to occupy a country to install in power a left-wing
priest who made a career out of denouncing America and everything it
stands for. Meanwhile, a few hundred miles closer to U.S. shores,
another Caribbean dictator abuses human rights and rules
undemocratically. Yet Fidel Castro is spared the fate of the Haitian
generals. The reasons for this double standard are as mysterious as
the reasons for occupying Haiti in the first place.

<BLOCKQUOTE> "Democracy... is not created by aspirations or by new faith;
     it is built up by slow habit.... It comes, like manhood, as

     maturity to which it is vouchsafed is the maturity of
     freedom and self-control, and no other."</BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P>
Woodrow Wilson, 1885 (As quoted in Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson:
Revolution, War, and Peace (Arlington Heights, Il: Harlan Davidson,
Inc., 1979,) p. 5.)

<P>

     Thirty years after offering this stern assessment of democracy,
President Wilson in 1915 invaded Haiti. His reason, he explained to
one White House visitor, was to "teach the South American republics to
elect good men!" (As cited in Allan R. Millett, Semper Fidelis: The
History of the United States Marine Corps (New York, NY: The Free
Press, 1991), p. 183. Millet's history of the 1915-1934 occupation is
one of the best available, and is the source for events described in
this paper, unless otherwise indicated. ) Five presidencies later,
Franklin Roosevelt in 1934 withdrew the U.S. Marines after a nearly
two-decade occupation that left Haiti no closer to democracy than when
Wilson sent them in.
<P>
     Oblivious to the central truth of Wilson's earlier statement --
that democracy "is built up by slow habit" -- President Clinton is
poised to repeat Wilson's mistake and invade Haiti to "restore
democracy." On July 25, Clinton Administration officials at the United
Nations circulated a draft resolution that would permit member states
to use "all necessary means" to reinstall deposed president Jean-
Bertrand Aristide. (Warren Strobel and Stewart Stogel, "U.S. sets the
stage for Haiti invasion," The Washington Times, July 26, 1994, p.
A1.) This is well-understood diplomatic parlance for "military force."
To emphasize the point, Clinton has dispatched a naval task force of
some dozen ships, including a 2,000-man Marine Expeditionary Unit, to
Haitian waters. Meanwhile, units of the Army's XVIIIth Airborne Corps
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, have over the past several weeks
conducted high-visibility training exercises.
<P>
     The question regarding a possible invasion is not whether U.S.
forces can defeat the 7,000-member Haitian military. That force has
very little artillery, no combat aircraft, and probably no more than
two hundred small arms rounds per man. (The Military Balance,
1993-1994 (London: International Institute for Strategic Studies,
1993), p. 187.) Few doubt the ability of the United States to occupy
Haiti in short order.
<P>
     The real question for the Clinton Administration is: Then what?
After having occupied Haiti, what will be the mission of that military
force? What can U.S. forces expect as they attend to that mission? And
what conditions must be met for its return to the United States? The
Administration's ability to answer these questions inspires little
confidence. As House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee Hamilton
(D-IN) has noted, "We are not thinking enough about what happens after
the invasion. There are concerns all around about the exit strategy."
(Tim Zimmerman, et al., "Caribbean cruise," U.S. News & World Report,
July 18, 1994, p. 37.) 
<P>

<B> NOT PANAMA, NOT GRENADA</B>
<P>
     In public statements on a possible invasion, Administration
officials have suggested that they intend to get U.S. forces in
quickly, kick out the junta, then remove U.S. combat troops and turn
the mission over to a multinational peacekeeping force. This quick
"exit strategy" would be patterned after either the invasion of
Grenada in 1983 or of Panama in 1989.
<P>
     But there are more differences than similarities between these
two countries and Haiti. Unlike Haiti, both Grenada and Panama had
functioning institutions and economies before the invasion; U.S.
forces could exit without creating a vacuum in their wake. Grenada was
part of the British Commonwealth whose titular head of state was a
Governor-General appointed by the Queen of England. Panama is the
permanent home of over 10,000 U.S. troops. It is also a hemispheric
banking capital and a de facto member of the U.S. commonwealth, where
the dollar is the legal tender. By comparison, Haiti is one of the
poorest nations in the world, with a per capita income of under $300
(before the U.S.-led embargo destroyed 95 percent of light
manufacturing jobs) and an illiteracy rate over 80 percent.
<P>
     Another difference is the threat to American lives, the proximate
cause for each of the earlier invasions. The Clinton Administration
has begun to refer to such a threat as a justification for the
military build-up around Haiti. But Americans in Haiti are safe; the
Administration has not reported a single instance of government-
induced violence toward any of the more than 3,000 Americans living in
Haiti. Indeed, a U.S. Embassy spokesman noted in a recent interview
that "as of right now, we know of no direct threats to Americans" (CNN
interview with Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy, Port-au-Prince,
broadcast July 26, 1994.)
<P>
     By contrast, in both Panama and Grenada, threats to Americans
were widespread, well-known, and directly attributable to government
actions. There were nearly one thousand U.S. medical students in
Grenada, where a shoot-on-sight curfew -- imposed after a Marxist coup
d'etat -- had been announced several days before the invasion. In
Panama, harassment of U.S. citizens by government troops had begun as
early as May 1989. This culminated in December 1989, when four off-
duty Marines were stopped at a Panamanian check-point. After an
altercation, the Panamanians opened fire on the American car, killing
one of the Marines. This was followed by the torture of an off-duty
naval officer and sexual assault of his wife by Panamanian Defense
Force soldiers. President Bush ordered the invasion the next day. In a
news conference less than a week later, he cited his reasons: "[T]he
death of the Marine; the brutalizing, really obscene torture of the
Navy lieutenant and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror
inflicted on that [officer's] wife;... the fact that our people
[weren't sure that] we could guarantee the safety of Americans there."
(David Adams, et al., "U.S. Invades Panama," Newsweek, January 1,
1990, p. 20.)
<P>

<B> HAITI: D-DAY PLUS ONE</B>
<P>
     Despite his rhetoric about safeguarding American lives, Clinton
has made no similar case for action in Haiti. A more likely model than
Grenada or Panama for a potential invasion of Haiti is the first U.S.
invasion of Haiti, executed also in the name of "democracy." Whether
American troops will remain this time for twenty years is an open
question. But the challenges facing an occupation force today would be
similar to those of eight decades ago. Before sending American troops
into Haiti to "restore democracy," President Clinton should explain to
the American people that those troops will be responsible for:
<P>
     
<B> Disarming the Haitian people</B>. 
<P>     Administration officials recently acknowledged that this would be
a high priority for occupation forces. (Daniel Williams, "If U.S.
Invades, Plans Call for Disarming Haitians," The Washington Post, July
21, 1994, p. A24.) But they give little indication how this might be
accomplished. In the 1915 invasion, the U.S. commander offered a
reward for each weapon turned in. (Brenda Gayle Plummer, Haiti and the
United States: The Psychological Moment (Athens, GA: The University of
Georgia Press, 1992), p. 93.) This did little to stop the gradual
escalation in violence that led ultimately to nearly 200 American and
probably five times as many Haitian casualties during the two-decade
occupation.
<P>
     More recently, disarming the various warring factions was a
priority for U.S. peacekeepers in Somalia after the June 1993 attack
on the U.N. operation. Despite a concentrated effort, over two-dozen
American servicemen lost their lives in armed exchanges several months
after the initiative was launched. 
<P>
<B> Protecting American citizens</B>. 
 <P>    The Administration has used this as a rationale for invading in
the first place. In a July 3 television interview, Clinton special
envoy William H. Gray III declared that "[t]he president has
responsibility to protect American lives.... [T]here is great concern
that we must be prepared to protect American citizens." (As cited in
Ann Devroy and Bradley Graham, "As Pressure Builds, U.S. Intensifies
Efforts to Recruit Peacekeepers for Haiti," The Washington Post, July
4, 1994, p. A20.) But some 3,000 Americans remain in Haiti despite the
junta's crackdown, and the Administration has not recounted one
instance of threats to Americans. Indeed, the common refrain from
American businesspersons and relief workers has been that they feel
safe -- "unless there is an invasion." (One American relief worker, a
Catholic nun who has been in Haiti for more than ten years, provided
representative testimony during a National Public Radio interview
broadcast on July 18, 1994.)
<P>
     Should there be one, the threat to Americans from Haitians
opposed to Aristide's return would be real. So while subduing whatever
armed resistance they may meet and maintaining calm in the crowded
slums of Port-au-Prince, U.S. troops would also have to contend with
organizing, protecting, and perhaps evacuating several thousand
Americans.
<P>
<B> Defeating guerrilla forces</B>. 
<P>     Initial opposition to the July 1915 invasion was light; two U.S.
sailors in the landing party were killed, probably by "friendly fire."
(Millet, op. cit., p. 185.) But this passivity was soon replaced by
the rise of well-organized guerrilla bands and their supporters
numbering in excess of 10,000. Bloody exchanges with the U.S. forces
culminated in a 1929 uprising by an armed mob in which U.S. Marines
killed or wounded dozens of Haitians. The resulting American
government investigation led eventually to the 1934 withdrawal of U.S.
forces.
<P>
     This history, together with recent experience with armed tribal
factions in Somalia, demands that the U.S. be ready for a similar
response to another invasion of Haiti. It appears that U.N. Secretary
General Bouros Boutros-Ghali has learned this lesson, even if the
Clinton Administration has not. Reluctant to see a U.N. peacekeeping
force left vulnerable after a U.S. evacuation, Boutros-Ghali recently
advised Administration officials that he would be unable to raise and
finance the 12,000- to 15,000-member multinational force the White
House has said will be necessary to pacify Haiti after an invasion.
(Ann Devroy and Bradley Graham, "U.S. Units Ready to Invade but
Clinton Is Said to Be Weeks From Decision," The Washington Post, July
17, 1994, p. A21.)
<P>
<B> Serving as Aristide's "palace guard."</B>
  <P>   Inasmuch as a U.S. invasion would be directed against the very
military and police forces responsible for civil order, their defeat
would require the occupation force to assume that responsibility. In
addition to crowd control, maintaining public order, and patrolling
Haiti's largest cities, this force would also have to provide
protection to Aristide. That could be a challenge; his divisive and
uncompromising approach to governance during his brief tenure as
Haiti's elected president led to two coup attempts (one successful)
and at least one assassination attempt against him.
<P>
     To ensure Aristide's survival, the Clinton Administration will
have to make Haiti essentially an American protectorate. This was the
objective of the 1915-1934 occupation; the September 1915 treaty
between the two countries called for, among other things, "the
creation of an American-officered national constabulary, and the use
of American engineers and public health officials to reform the public
works and sanitation systems." (Millet, op. cit., p. 185.)
<P>
     Those objectives differ little from those outlined by Senator Bob
Graham (D-FL), a leading proponent of a U.S. invasion, during recent
Senate debate: "[I]t is going to be necessary to have a very effective
political reform, starting with the separation of the police from the
military, and economic reform, starting with creating the stimulus for
the private sector to commence activities again.... " (Congressional
Record - Senate, July 14, 1994, p. S8967.) Who will do this
"separating" and "creating" after the combined effect of the U.S.
embargo and invasion have turned Haiti into a de facto U.S. colony?
<P>


<B> BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE</B>
<P>
     It is not too late for the President to step back from the threat
of using force to reinstall Aristide. Clinton has already demonstrated
a remarkable ability to reverse course on major policies; indeed, his
Haiti saber-rattling belies his October 1993 declaration: "I have no
intention of asking our young people in uniform... to go in there to
do anything other than implement a peace agreement.... " Changing his
policy now will save American lives from being squandered in pursuit
of democracy in this hemisphere's least democratic country. (For a
full discussion, see Lawrence T. Di Rita, "Read My Flips: Clinton's
Foreign Policy Reversals In His Own Words," Heritage Foundation FYI
No. 19, June 20, 1994.)
<P>
     To defuse this crisis of his own making, Clinton should take two
actions immediately:
<P>
<B> Lift the economic embargo on Haiti.</B>
  <P>   Since economic sanctions were intensified on June 16, nearly
25,000 refugees have left Haiti in pursuit of a better life anywhere
else. Nearly 16,000 refugees remain in what is little more than a
concentration camp at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Meanwhile, the military leaders against whom the sanctions supposedly
are targeted appear unaffected. Representative Bill Richardson (D-NM)
recently was the guest of junta leader Raoul Cedras at a five-hour
dinner/discussion; presumably the table was full.
<P>
     Economic sanctions are a blunt and usually ineffective instrument
of foreign policy. August 2 marks the four-year anniversary of
sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait; Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein has outlasted the American leader who imposed them. The
Serbian leadership in Bosnia has just rejected the West's latest
cease-fire proposal, despite the tough sanctions imposed on their
principal supporters in neighboring Serbia. In Haiti, sanctions
imposed after the 1991 coup against Aristide have only destroyed the
subsistence economy there and created the very refugee crisis the
Administration now cites as a principal justification for ending the
stalemate by force.
<P>
     Lifting the embargo will ease the immediate crisis and allow
refugees to return to a better life in Haiti. It is a necessary first
step to a negotiated solution to this tragedy.
<P>
<B> Appoint a presidential commission to examine other options</B>. 
<P>     The Senate defeated by a party-line vote an amendment offered by
Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) to appoint a bi-partisan
congressional commission to assess "the humanitarian, political, and
diplomatic conditions in Haiti and [report] to the Congress on the
appropriate policy options available to the United States.... "
(Congressional Record - Senate, July 14, 1994, p. S8940.) This option
would have resulted in a 45-day "cooling off period" that Clinton
could have used to generate bi-partisan support for a new policy
toward Haiti.
<P>
     In appointing a commission, Clinton would be responding to
democratic forces in Haiti. The Haitian Chamber of Deputies, whose
members can claim democratic legitimacy equal to Aristide's since they
achieved office in the same election that brought Aristide to power,
has consistently proposed negotiation over confrontation. Recalling
Nelson Mandela, who "achieved a consensus that has allowed formation
of his new government," Haitian Deputy Duly Brutus counseled this
approach in a recent Washington Post editorial. (Duly Brutus,
"Alternative To Invasion," The Washington Post, July 7, 1994, p. A19.
Deputy Brutus was elected in December 1990 (when Aristide was elected)
and served as president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1991.) 
<P>
     Clinton is right to oppose a congressionally mandated commission;
the President is the constitutionally designated executor of U.S.
foreign policy. He should take the initiative away from the Congress
and appoint his own commission. In other crises, he has shown no
aversion to last-minute negotiations: he sent former President Jimmy
Carter to North Korea to make one last appeal for negotiations to end
the nuclear weapons program in that country. If Clinton is willing to
conduct negotiations with a communist dictator bent on acquiring
nuclear weapons, certainly there can be little danger in doing the
same with a petty military junta in poor Haiti.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION
</B><P>
     The history of Haiti is a sad one, made no better by a two-decade
U.S. military occupation in the name of democracy. In the seven years
prior to the 1915 U.S. invasion, seven successive presidents were
overthrown by force. This has been the norm in the nearly two
centuries since Haiti's independence. Aristide is only the latest to
receive such treatment. In response, the U.S.-led economic embargo and
threats of another invasion only have increased the misery of a
population that has been promised "democracy" in return.
<P>
     Before adding American casualties and more Haitian deaths to his
strange policy brew, Clinton must explain to the American people
exactly what a U.S. invasion would entail. If he fails to do so, he
should not be surprised when angry Americans demand an explanation why
even a single U.S. life should be lost to "restore democracy" to a
country that has never known it.

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<b>Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging 
Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments
<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>

<center><i><h3>BUDGET CUTS COULD SPELL END OF AMERICAN GLOBAL POWER</h3></i>

Backgrounder Update #258<br>
August 1, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1019, "A Game Plan for Restoring America's Defenses," February 3, 1995)</center>
<p>
<hr size=3 width =50%>
<p>
	Formulating a sound national security policy is no simple matter. It requires more than merely deciding how much to spend on defense. Vital national interests must be identified. A strategy for defending these vital interests must be fashioned. The forces to execute the strategy must be designed and explained to Congress and the American people. Only when all these steps in the process have been accomplished can the President and Congress determine how much money is needed to fund the nation's defense requirements.
<p>
	The budget policies of both the Clinton Administration and Congress, however, reverse the process of formulating national security policy. Both start by asking not how much defense capability the nation needs, but how much, given other priorities, they are willing to spend on national security. While affordability always enters into the process of deliberating on the defense budget, it should not be the starting point in making national security policy. The starting point should be a rational assessment of the country's defense needs.
<p>
	This "budget-driven" approach carries with it potentially severe implications for the nation's defense posture. If the President and Congress do not change course on defense budget policy, the result will be forces smaller than those needed to execute the national strategy, a collapse of the strategy itself, and ultimately the exposure of America's vital national interests to foreign threats. While there is still time to alter course, Congress needs to address this pressing problem during the next 18 months. If it fails, by early in the next decade the United States may find itself no longer a global military power capable of defending all of its vital interests.
<p>
	Changing the course of the defense budget was going to be the job of a special commission created by the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), adopted by the House of Representatives on February 16, 1995. But the Senate version of the Defense Authorization Bill includes no provision for a special commission. While the failure of the Senate Armed Services Committee to include this provision is regrettable, a study similar to the one that was to be undertaken by the special commission can still go forward. Congress could appoint a staff group similar to one that studied the requirements for reorganizing the military in 1985.
<p>

<b>Clinton and Congress: Different Paths to the Same Result
</B><p>
	Congress on June 29 adopted a budget resolution that establishes the nation's fiscal blueprint for fiscal years 1996-2002.1 This blueprint includes budgetary guidelines for defense spending. Anticipating Congress's action, President Bill Clinton submitted a new budget plan of his own on June 13. However, Clinton's spending on defense remained essentially the same as he had proposed in his original fiscal 1996 budget in February 1995. The congressional budget resolution would provide $1,904.2 billion in budget authority for defense over the next seven years, while the Clinton proposal would provide $1,894.6 billion.2 Thus, Congress added $9.6 billion to Clinton's request for defense -- an increase of only 0.5 percent. For all intents and purposes, Clinton's seven-year defense budget request and the congressional budget resolution on defense are roughly the same.
<p>
	While the amount spent on defense is about the same, the two budget proposals differ sharply as to how and when the funds would be distributed over time. The Clinton Administration would impose steep reductions in the early years, later holding the line on further cuts. The congressional budget resolution, by contrast, spreads out defense budget reductions evenly over the next seven years (see Chart 1). This is why the Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal 1996, which reflects the requirements of the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year alone, will provide almost $7 billion more in budget authority than requested by the Clinton Administration.3 The Clinton Administration would provide more for defense than the budget resolution in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Ultimately, both proposals anticipate a defense budget in 2002 that is less than 60 percent of what it was in fiscal 1985.

<p>
<b>The Retreat of America as a Global Military Power
</b><p>
	Since the Clinton Administration's and Congress's defense budget proposals are similar, the ultimate outcome for defense likewise would be similar: a forced retreat of the U.S. from its position as a global military power able to defend its global interests. If enacted, these defense budget proposals would cause at least six results.
<p>
<b>RESULT #1:</b> Force structure levels would have to be reduced by roughly 20 percent from those recommended in Clinton's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). In September 1993, the Clinton Administration announced the findings of its comprehensive Bottom-Up Review of defense policy. The study called for the Army to field the equivalent of between 15 and 16 divisions, the Air Force to deploy 20 tactical fighter wings, the Navy to retain 346 ships (including 12 aircraft carriers), and the Marine Corps to maintain 174,000 active-duty personnel. However, the Clinton Administration is not providing nearly enough money to sustain its recommended force structure. Analysts at The Heritage Foundation estimate that the five-year (FY 1996-2000) funding shortfall will be around $110 billion.4	The defense funding levels envisioned in the congressional budget resolution will not make up this shortfall. In fact, Congress is moving in the same direction as the Clinton Administration, albeit at a slower pace.	Assuming a defense budget that balances the requirements for readiness and modernization, these funding levels will force the adoption of a smaller force structure.5 This smaller force structure would include the equivalent of 12 Army divisions (instead of the 15-16 envisioned by the BUR); 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings (instead of 20); 300 Navy ships (instead of 346); and 140,000 active-duty Marines (instead of 174,000) (see Chart 2).
<p>
<b>RESULT #2:</b> Military personnel levels would have to shrink by roughly 15 percent below those recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. The Bottom-Up Review recommended that military personnel levels be reduced to 2,366,000 positions (active and reserve components combined) by the end of the decade. However, as a result of the impending defense budget cuts, personnel levels will drop -- as will overall force structure levels -- by almost 15 percent from levels recommended by the BUR, to 2,050,000 positions.
<p>
<b>RESULT #3:</b> The U.S. will not have enough military forces to fight a major regional conflict on the scale of the Persian Gulf War without abandoning its security commitments in non-combat theaters. Given the smaller conventional forces mandated by defense budget cuts, the U.S. would be hard-pressed to field the force it assembled to fight and win the Persian Gulf War. The only way it could do so would be to take forces from other regions that were not immediately threatened. But this would mean possibly abandoning security commitments in other parts of the world.
<p>
	A couple of examples demonstrate this point. During the Persian Gulf War, the equivalent of ten Air Force fighter wings were deployed in the combat theater. But these ten equivalents were drawn from 20 established fighter wings.6 For every fighter wing engaged in combat, the Air Force needed the equivalent of another wing to provide backup for maintenance and replacement in case aircraft were shot down, and to train and rotate crews. Even using a more liberal three-to-two ratio, as some defense analysts do, the U.S. would be barely able to muster the tactical air forces needed to fight a single regional conflict with the smaller force. Deploying ten tactical fighter wings in a future regional war would tie up 15 wings. Thus, virtually everything would be absorbed by a single conflict. The likely result would be for the Air Force to pull all of its tactical aircraft from, say, Europe and Asia if the conflict occurred in the Persian Gulf. 
<p>
	 The situation would be no less grim for the U.S. Army. The Army deployed seven divisions in the Persian Gulf.7 All seven were active divisions. Given the time to bring reserve component units up to full combat readiness, a future major regional conflict would place a premium on active divisions to perform combat missions. However, Clinton's and Congress's budgets would support only eight active Army divisions and the equivalent of four divisions in the reserve component. If seven active divisions are needed for a regional conflict, as occurred during the Gulf War, virtually all of the Army's active divisions will be absorbed. The eighth active division will have to remain in the U.S. to train the reserve units that may be needed to reinforce active-duty troops engaged in combat.
<p>
	The implication is clear: If a war broke out in the Persian Gulf, the Army would be unable to meet its commitments to other U.S. allies in Europe and Asia if they were threatened at the same time. Of the eight active divisions the budget would allow the Army to retain, three would be deployed in Europe and Korea even though they were needed in the Persian Gulf. Like the Air Force, the Army would have to abandon these theaters to fight in the Persian Gulf.
<p>
	Finally, the budget plans of the Administration and Congress would leave the U.S. Navy very thin. The budget would allow the Navy to maintain eight active carriers and one training carrier. Typically, two or three of these would be unavailable at any one time because of necessary maintenance. Therefore, if two aircraft carriers were in port for maintenance, only six would remain for active duty. But during the Persian Gulf War the Navy deployed six carriers to the region.8 In other words, practically the entire U.S. Navy would be needed to fight and win a single regional conflict on the order of the Persian Gulf War, leaving only one training carrier to defend American interests in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Result #4: The regional-based national security strategy will collapse. Immediately following the end of the Cold War, there was a consensus that U.S. conventional forces must be prepared to confront aggression in regions of vital interest to the United States. This consensus was reflected in the Bush Administration's "Base Force" and the Clinton Administration's 1993 Bottom-Up Review force. Both Bush and Clinton agreed that America needed enough military power to fight and win more than one major regional war, whether in Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
	However, if current defense budget resolutions are maintained, this goal will not be achieved. The consensus established immediately after the Cold War will be shattered. There will not be enough military forces to win more than a single regional conflict at any one time.
<p>
<b>Result #5:</b> With the collapse of the regional-based strategy, the alliance structure will be gravely jeopardized. If the Persian Gulf War took place in 2002 under projected defense budgets, the U.S. would have to withdraw and use the forces that are in Asia and Europe. As this reality dawns on America's allies in Europe and Asia, the credibility of the U.S. security commitment will come into question. America's allies surely will ask: What is the value of a U.S. security guarantee when American forces, under some circumstances, will not be able to fulfill their obligations? As a result, these allies may seek other ways to meet their security needs.
<p>
	The most likely casualty is NATO. The Europeans already are uncertain about America's credibility and staying power. The more apparent it becomes that the U.S. will be unable to meet its NATO commitments, the more Europe will be inclined to try new, untested defense structures built on the European Union and not NATO. Under these circumstances, an independent European nuclear force, with Germany's direct involvement, is not out of the question.
<p>
	In Asia the consequences of declining American military credibility are equally disturbing. Japan has two options. It could re-arm and become a major regional military power in its own right, something that would cause concern throughout Asia, or it could accommodate stronger regional military powers such as China and Russia and play one against the other whenever possible. Without America's protection, South Korea would likely want to expand its military power rapidly, in hopes of deterring a North Korean attack, but this certainly would lead to instability on the Korean Peninsula. The implication is clear: If American military power in Asia wanes, the results will be a new arms race, greater instability, and the greater likelihood of war. 
<p>
	 The same adverse dynamic would arise toward U.S. friends and allies in the Middle East if a future regional conflict occured outside the Persian Gulf. The Gulf Arab states would likely expand their existing policy of playing their stronger and more radical neighbors, Iran and Iraq, against each other. This policy, however, failed when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Israel, being prepared to defend itself as long as the U.S. continues material assistance, should be able to provide for its security.
<p>
	The hard fact remains that while the level of threat has decreased with the end of the Cold War, U.S. commitments to maintaining the security of Europe, Asia, and other regions have not. If the U.S. allows these commitments to come into question, the alliances it still needs may fall apart. 
<p>
<b>RESULT #6:</b> U.S. vital interests would be threatened. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has recognized that its security was linked inextricably to events in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Persian Gulf. Thus, the U.S. has recognized the need not only to maintain a balance of power in these regions, but to protect access to resources located in them, such as oil. Moreover, U.S. strategy has assumed that American economic prosperity depends on a free and open system of international trade.
<p>
	However, the Clinton and congressional budget resolutions would threaten each of these vital interests. A budget-driven withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf would be tantamount to writing off these regions as unworthy of defense. Two world wars in this century should have taught Americans that this is a dangerous thing to do. No less so than during the 1930s, America cannot put its head in the sand. In fact, the security of the United States is more intertwined with that of the rest of the world today than in any other time in history.
<p>
	A less apparent but no less important benefit of U.S. global military power is the security of the international economic and trade system. Some expect that the free trade system will survive even if the U.S. abandons its security commitments. This is overly optimistic. The global trade system is supported by a well-defined and strongly supported security structure. If this structure collapsed, the trade system could collapse with it. The result could be the emergence of hostile trading blocs, with trade used not as a means to prosperity, but as a weapon in political wars.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>
	Congress cannot afford to ignore the emerging crisis in the defense budget. Urgent attention needs to be paid to ensuring that defense budgets reflect accurately the requirements of a sound national security strategy.
<P>
	The question of how best to resolve this crisis could be addressed by authorizing a congressional staff study on how to close the gap between defense budgets and national security requirements. The study could weigh the benefits of increasing the budget against the risks of reducing U.S. security commitments. The staff could be appointed by the chairmen of the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. This group would be similar to the one which produced a report in 1985 on military reorganization.9 The two chairmen should direct their staffs to pool their efforts and produce a report before the consideration of the budget resolution by Congress next year. The entire Senate could show its support by adopting a sense of the Senate resolution asking the two chairmen to appoint such a staff group as it considers the Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>
	If current defense budget trends continue, America's days as a global military power capable of defending all its global interests will be numbered. No amount of rationalization can cover up this hard, cold fact. New technologies will not save America from this disastrous outcome. Nor will new strategies that downplay threats to American interests. Only a sound strategy that matches means and ends can ensure the survival of American freedom and prosperity through the next century.

<P>

          "We must not cut defense further."  This quote is from the
State of the Union Address President Clinton gave a little over a year ago. 
Yet on February 6, the President submitted his fiscal year 1996-2000 budget
proposal, which indeed cuts defense further.  His new proposal would
reduce defense spending by 5.3 percent in FY 1996 and an additional 4.1
percent in FY 1997.  In fact, the Clinton proposal for the entire five-year
period would slash the defense budget by over $140 billion (in budget
authority) from the Congressional Budget Office's January 1995 baseline,
which is the standard against which Congress votes to increase or decrease
federal spending.
     <P>
               The problem is actually worse than these budget
figures suggest.  The amount the Clinton Administration has budgeted for
defense is not enough to fully fund the Administration's own defense
program.  In fact, because of the Administration's unwillingness to
acknowledge the cost of its program, the Clinton defense budget will fall
short by $110 billion from 1996 to 2000.  This shortfall will have a
devastating effect on combat readiness, the morale of U.S.  troops, and the
quality and effectiveness of American arms.  The specific effects of this
shortfall will be to:
<P>
     Lower troop morale and hamper recruitment.
 <P>    
          Under the Clinton plan, military pay will not keep up with
inflation.  Previous Clinton Administration defense budgets have not
accounted fully for the effects of inflation, and this new budget is no
exception.  The Administration has requested a 2.4 percent pay raise for
military personnel in 1996; the Congressional Budget Office estimates that
inflation will be 3.4 percent next year.  The trend of not adjusting pay to
account fully for the effects of inflation continues throughout the five-year
budget period (see Chart 1).  If inflation remains at 3.4 percent a year for
the next five years, the average soldier's pay will drop by almost 10 percent
in real terms.  These cuts in real wages not only will hamper the services'
ability to recruit and retain high-quality personnel, they will badly damage
morale.
   <P>  
     Weaken combat readiness.
  <P>   
          Despite Clinton Administration claims that it is giving
military readiness the highest priority, readiness funding levels are falling. 
Readiness is funded mainly by the operations and maintenance account of
the defense budget.  These funds pay for the daily costs of running and
maintaining the nation's armed forces.  As with military pay, funding levels
for operations and maintenance will decline in real terms because of a
failure to adjust for inflation (see Chart 2).  Instead of letting readiness
funding levels drop, the Administration should tap into the $11 billion in
non-defense activities that the Pentagon will be forced to spend in 1995. 
Congress should reinvest savings from these programs in near-term readiness
programs.
  <P>   
     Deny troops the advanced weaponry they need to prevail over
America's foes.
  <P>   
          Funding for military research and development will drop
dramatically in the Clinton defense budget (see Chart 3).  The
Administration requested $36.2 billion (in 1995 dollars) for research and
development in the current fiscal year.  By the year 2000, the U.S.  will be
spending only $25 billion (in 1995 dollars).  This 30 percent drop in
research and development funding levels will shrink the pool of technologies
from which the next generation of weapons will be drawn.  As a result, U.S. 
armed forces may lose their technological superiority over potential foes. 
If this happens, the low-cost victory of the Persian Gulf War, where
casualties were kept low because of U.S.  technological superiority, will be
a thing of the past. 
  <P>   
      Assure an armed force too small and weak to win the nation's
wars.
<P>     
          A 1995 report by the General Accounting Office (GAO)
states that the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force will not be able to
handle two major regional wars "nearly simultaneously," as promised by the
Pentagon.  If the under-funding of the BUR force continues, the U.S.  may
be hard-pressed to win even one major regional war.  The reason:  the
military would be forced to make cuts to levels significantly below those
recommended in the BUR.
     
   <P>  
     
     Fixing the Problem
    <P> 
          The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 defense budget, like
its predecessors, is woefully inadequate.  It is up to the Congress to do
something about the Clinton assault on national security funding.  To protect
American security, Congress should: 
<P>
      Fund military pay at the cost of inflation.  This means funding the
military pay account at somewhat less than $79 billion in current ("then
year") dollars by the year 2000, the last year in the five-year program.
 <P>    
     Adjust operations and maintenance levels of funding to levels of
inflation. 
 <P>    
      Increase funding for research and development to $46.9 billion in
current dollars by the year 2000.
  <P>   
     Reinvest non-defense funds in the defense fund budget in national
security programs.
<P>
          Congress should scale back spending programs in the defense
budget that have little or nothing to do with national defense.  Some of this
spending supports civilian athletic events and extensive non-defense medical
research programs.  Spending on these programs should be applied to
maintaining near-term readiness.
<P>
     
     Conclusion
    <P> 
          By a vote of 241-181, the House of Representatives on
February 16 passed the National Security Revitalization Act, pledging "to
reassess United States military needs and reverse the continuing downward
spiral of defense spending."  Congress can start fulfilling this pledge by
stopping the Clinton assault on funding for national security.  The choice is
clear:  Will America remain a global power able to defend American
freedom and prosperity?  Or will the United States shrink as a great power
and become vulnerable to the whims and threats of the many dangerous
forces existing in the world today?  Congress has the power to ensure that
the country makes the right choice.

 President Bill Clinton on December 1 recognized publicly what others
have long known: America's armed forces are woefully underfunded to
perform the missions that have been assigned to them. Clinton
announced a plan to ask Congress for some $2 billion in supplemental
appropriations for defense in fiscal 1995 to pay for peacekeeping
operations in Haiti and elsewhere. He also outlined an additional $25
billion for the six years from 1996 through 2001.
<P>
     Clinton's announcement is a good first step toward correcting the
decline in military readiness that has occurred during his tenure, but it
does not go far enough. Outside estimates of the shortfall in defense
spending range from The Heritage Foundation's $100 billion to the
General Accounting Office's $150 billion. Military pay has fallen behind
comparable civilian pay by as much as 12 percent. Funds needed for
day-to-day operations and maintenance are now being used to pay for
unexpected and unfunded peacekeeping operations like the one in Haiti.
Future force modernization is threatened both by a drastic decline in
procurement spending and by a significant reduction in research and
development spending. And the size and organization of the armed
forces are inadequate to meet the Administration's official goal of being
able to fight and win two major regional conflicts "nearly
simultaneously."
<P>
Opening for Congress.
<P>
Clinton's defense spending increases are not enough to correct all of these
problems. Only declining military pay is addressed by the Administration's
plan. More must be done. Congress must now step in and solve the many
problems caused by Clinton's underfunding of America's armed forces.
 <P>
     Much of this will be done if Congress passes the "Contract With
America," the GOP's campaign platform in the last election. One of the bills
in the Contract is the National Security Restoration Act, which
acknowledges the Clinton Administration's defense planning shortcomings,
particularly the shortfalls in defense spending. The bill raises concerns about
the impact of defense cuts on combat readiness, force structure, weapons
modernization, and ballistic missile defense programs.
<P>
     The supplemental appropriations bill Clinton intends to introduce will
give Congress a chance to get an early start on addressing issues in the
Contract. Thus, Congress should:
<P>
Add $8 billion to $10 billion to the $2 billion requested by Clinton for fiscal
1995, most of which should go for modernization. This additional funding
should be used to replace aging weapons with modern ones and to develop
new ones. Because of funding cuts, many weapons are being kept
operational longer than they should be. For example, the average age of the
Army's main battle tank will have more than doubled by the end of the
decade. On top of that, defense cuts are inhibiting the Pentagon's ability to
develop new generation weapons to replace old ones. Research and
development funding has dropped by 10 percent in real terms since
President Clinton took office. This reduction has had a severe impact on the
program to develop anti-missile defenses. Unless something is done to
reverse these trends, American soldiers will be relying on aging weapons
that may be not only worn out, but also outdated. U.S. forces need modern
weapons and equipment to prevail on the battlefield and to reduce casualties,
as was demonstrated during the Persian Gulf War.
 <P>
 Place strict limits on U.S. participation in "operations other than war,"
including peacekeeping. The National Security Restoration Act in the
Contract With America ensures a great deal more congressional oversight
of U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping than has been the case. This will
include a requirement that the President specify "the source of funding for
the [U.S.] share of the costs" prior to committing forces. This should stop
what has become the common practice of diverting funds intended for fuel,
training, and routine maintenance. But Congress should consider applying
similar constraints to peacekeeping operations for the remainder of fiscal
1995. The options include asking the Pentagon in advance for a proposed
budget for an operation, limiting the portion of the force that may be
committed to such operations, and requiring that the Secretary of Defense
certify that all military combat units are in the highest readiness status
before new peacekeeping or humanitarian missions are undertaken.
<P>
     As these measures are undertaken, Congress should specify that no
action taken to constrain the participation of U.S. forces in United Nations
operations should be construed as a restriction on the President's freedom
to dispatch U.S. forces in defense of U.S. interests or in a national
emergency. In doing so, Congress would be drawing a clear distinction
between legitimate constraints on U.S. participation in U.N. operations and
inadvisable restrictions on presidential prerogatives as imposed by the War
Powers Resolution of 1973. This Resolution unwisely interferes with the
President's authority as commander in chief to deploy forces in defense of
American interests. 
<P>
Remove non-defense spending from the Pentagon's budget.
The Congressional Research Service has identified $5.8 billion in the 1995
defense authorization bill for "items that may not be directly related to
traditional military capabilities." This includes $10 million for "U.S.-Japan
Management Training" and nearly $300 million for AIDS, prostate, and
breast cancer research. When environmental clean-up and research programs
are included, this figure rises to more than $11 billion. This list is a good
starting point for obtaining funds within the defense budget to apply
improving readiness.
 <P>
Restore the ballistic missile defense program.<P>
The Contract With America places a high priority on restoring America's
missile defense program, which has been practically decimated by Clinton's
cuts. A good first step would be to spend between $1 billion and $2 billion
of the $8 billion to $10 billion in additional funding for ballistic missile
defense in fiscal 1995. Programs targeted for increased spending should be
1) the space-based interceptor program, 2) the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric
Projectile (LEAP) interceptor program, 3) the "Brilliant Eyes" sensor
satellite for detecting and tracking enemy missiles in flight, 4) the advanced
light-weight satellite program, 5) the Navy's Upper-Tier Interceptor
program, 6) the space-based laser program, and 7) the Boost-Phase
Interceptor program.
<P>
     Congress should also consider passing an amendment directing the
Administration to observe a moratorium on negotiations with Russia or other
countries regarding the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This
treaty, which bans the deployment of strategic defenses, is outdated and
should be abandoned. An agreement with the Russians to change the
agreement cosmetically would only perpetuate a treaty that does not serve
American security interests.
<P>
CONCLUSION <P>
President Clinton's decision to increase defense spending is an
acknowledgment of what many have known for over a year: The Clinton
Administration has been underfunding America's armed forces. It also is an
acknowledgment of a central premise of the Contract With America:
Sending U.S. forces on peacekeeping and other U.N. errands while
drastically cutting the defense budget is a recipe for declining military
readiness. The $25 billion supplemental spending request for the Pentagon
is a good start in correcting this problem. But the job of restoring America's
military strength is not done. It is up to the 104th Congress to resolve a
problem which the President allowed to get out of hand.

<h2>The Prisoners' Accomplice</h2>

        <font size="+1">T</font>he 288 most dangerous convicts in Maryland are incarcerated in "Supermax," the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Supermax is a prisoners' prison, one in a growing class of "supermaximum security" facilities that take the worst of the worst--murderers and rapists who have continued their violent behavior while on the inside -- and lock them away in a redoubt of fortified walls and high-technology surveillance equipment. Supermaxes exist to isolate "bad" prisoners from the general population, and in turn, these incorrigibles from each other.<p>

<td hspace=5> 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While some see supermaxes as civilized society's last line of defense against its most violent predators, others see them as cruel and unusual punishment. This latter group includes the ACLU's National Prison Project, the National Campaign to Stop Control Unit Prisons, and, most recently, the Clinton <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">Justice Department</a>. 
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, has threatened to sue Maryland for alleged violations of prisoners' civil rights at Supermax. Maryland officials vehemently deny the charges. The Clinton administration, they claim, is conducting a quiet campaign on behalf of prisoners that belies its tough-on-crime rhetoric. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even as President Clinton proposes a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims, these officials charge, his Justice Department is trying to expand the rights of prisoners by singling out Supermax. And although the president has signed legislation to liberate state prisons from activist federal judges and groundless prisoner lawsuits, his political appointees are attempting to micromanage the incarceration of the states' most dangerous convicts. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rico Marzano is one such convict. In a 1987 drug deal that went bad, Marzano shot and killed four people, including two pregnant women. He was convicted of first-degree murder and placed in a maximum security facility. After his second escape attempt, he was sent to Supermax.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland's highest security prison houses three kinds of inmates: "serious institutional rule violators" (typically inmates who have assaulted or killed guards or other inmates); serious escape risks, like Marzano; and prisoners awaiting death sentences, like Anthony Brandison, who paid a man $9,000 to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in a 1983 federal drug case. In all, 105 murderers and 19 rapists spend their days in Supermax in what the corrections system calls "restricted confinement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Inmates remain alone 23 hours a day in their 65-square-foot concrete cells. They are allowed no physical contact with other prisoners or guards; meals are passed through a narrow slit -- a "beanhole" -- in solid metal cell doors. Out-of-cell time is spent alone, in a windowless prison dayroom. "When we were letting them rec [recreate] together they were killing each other, so we had to stop," said William Sondervan, Maryland's assistant commissioner for security operations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite such concern for the safety of inmates -- not to mention the prison staff -- the Clinton Justice Department insists that the isolation of inmates at Supermax is "the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe." But the staff must maintain order among prisoners who regularly hurl "correctional cocktails" of feces, urine, and other bodily fluids and often have to be forcibly removed from their cells. It is obviously frustrating, then, that prison officials must also fight a legal battle to protect what they see as a valuable -- and legal -- correctional tool. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Each year, the 50 states spend $81 million defending themselves against prisoner lawsuits seeking redress for civil rights "violations" ranging from insufficiently stylish footwear to faulty television reception. This epidemic of prisoner litigation -- one-fourth of the civil cases filed in federal trial courts last year were initiated by prisoners -- is complemented by federal judges who impose "voluntary" consent decrees on states. In 1990, more than 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial edicts covering everything from inmate population caps to how many electrical outlets each cell must have. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This litigation explosion has greatly circumscribed the control of states over their own prison systems. Some states have passed legislation curbing prisoner lawsuits, but attorneys general from Tallahassee to Phoenix have looked to Congress for federal relief. Congress responded earlier this year by passing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.866:">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a>. The legislation, which forces prisoners to pick up the tab for lawsuits and limits the ability of judges to impose consent decrees, was signed by Clinton as part of a larger spending bill last April. But the ink had barely dried on Clinton's signature before his Justice Department stepped in to substitute for the liberal federal judges  whose meddling in state prison systems had been curtailed by the legislation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 13-page letter to Maryland governor Parris Glendening, Deval Patrick charged that Supermax was violating inmates' constitutional rights through a range of offenses from inadequate exercise equipment to lukewarm meals. He gave the state 49 days to comply with a three-page list of "necessary remedial measures," or else face a federal lawsuit. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thirty states, the federal government, and Canada all have supermaxes -- one-third of which have been created since 1991. These facilities have already established a track record of success as pressure-release valves for overburdened state prison systems. In the 1970s, before California built its supermax, one out of every 1,200 prisoners was murdered by a fellow inmate. Today, that rate has shrunk by tenfold, to one in 12,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tom Coughlin, a former New York State Corrections Commissioner, says he saw a "dramatic reduction" in violence in his prisons following the construction of the New York supermax a decade ago. Despite their success -- or perhaps because of it -- supermaxes have become the target, many corrections officials believe, of a systematic bias within the Department of Justice. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland prison commissioner Sondervan says he is  "shocked" and "insulted" by the charges leveled against Supermax by Patrick. Department of Justice investigators, he believes, came into the facility with their minds already made up. "They came in with a political agenda," Sondervan says. "Their charges don't reflect the truth" about conditions at the prison. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Prisoner litigation typically germinates in the expansive environs of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." Federal civil rights investigators, Maryland officials charge, seem to believe that supermaximum facilities by their very existence are cruel and unusual. In his letter to Glendening, Patrick admitted he was "unable to find evidence of a pattern of physical abuse by Supermax staff against inmates." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What he did find, however, was a host of violations of prisoners' "rights." Among them were the "rights" to outdoor exercise, piping hot meals, and daily visits by medical personnel. In a sharply worded rejoinder, the Maryland attorney general's office told Patrick that his charges reflect his civil rights division's "philosophical opposition to 'super maximum' facilities without regard to constitutional criteria." They noted that the law allows the Department of Justice to redress only "egregious" constitutional violations, a standard, they argued, that was not met by the charges leveled by Patrick. Former New York prisons commissioner Coughlin agrees that the Justice Department too often acts without legal cause. "Look up the word 'egregious' and the meaning is not lukewarm food," says Coughlin. "There is no constitutional right to rehabilitation. You have to protect people from harm -- that's the constitutional right. The Department of Justice says isolating prisoners is causing harm. But as far as I'm concerned, if officers are not hitting individuals with sticks, there is no constitutional harm being done." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials suspected Department of Justice investigators of a broader political agenda because Patrick's letter referred to Pelican Bay prison, a notorious facility in California that has been referred to as a "neo-Orwellian hell." Conditions at Supermax, Patrick wrote, were "similar" to those found at Pelican Bay, a supermax that had been the object of a huge 1991 class-action suit alleging physical and mental abuse of prisoners. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials believe that the Department of Justice has set out to expand prisoners' rights by building on the case law established by Pelican Bay litigation. A federal judge found extensive abuses at that prison and ruled that the severe isolation of inmates there could exacerbate and even cause psychosis and other mental problems. Maryland officials strenuously object to the comparison. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> that it was "outrageous" and "inflammatory" to compare Supermax with Pelican Bay. "The fact that they have to reach so far to make the comparison makes you suspicious of the people who wrote this," she said of the Justice Department report.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Such an agenda, officials admit, is perplexing given the anticrime sentiment prevalent this election year. And the timing of the investigation of Supermax -- coincident with the president's approval of the Prison Litigation Reform Act -- only muddies the Clinton administration's message on criminal-justice issues. "Deval Patrick has painted himself into a box on this one," a Maryland prison official says. "The Prison Litigation Reform Act really captures the national view of how people feel about prisons." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, Maryland corrections officials remain in a tense standoff with federal officials over the future of Supermax. Unfortunately, they can't look to the Prison Litigation Reform Act for relief; it spares states the tyranny of liberal federal judges and litigious inmates, but not federal regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hatch/">Senator Orrin Hatch</a>, one of the authors of the Act, recently decided to try the direct approach: He appealed to the Clinton administration to drop its insistence that inmates at Supermax have a constitutional right to fresh air. "Many, if not all, of the murderers in this group are lucky to be breathing indoor air at all," the senator says, "which is more than their victims are doing right now."

<h2>Japan's Parole Models</h2><br>
by <b>Leslie Gardner</b>
</center><p>
	To bring America's crime explosion under control, new prisons and longer sentences will not 
be enough. Most criminals are eventually released, and most return to a life of crime. In addition 
to tougher law enforcement, we need to find ways to turn former criminals into law-abiding 
citizens. Perhaps here, Americans can learn from the success of volunteer probation and parole 
officers in Japan.
<P>
	America's current system of probation and parole is a joke. On average, each of the nation's 
35,000 probation and parole officers must supervise 100 convicts. With so many charges, the 
typical officer is lucky if he can find his parolees or probationers, let alone monitor their 
movements. "Most state probation and parole systems have a serious problem with case 
overload," says Steve Varnum, the executive director of Justice Fellowship at Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. "This leads to a high percentage of parole and probation violations, with many 
offenders returning to prison." 
<p>
	Japan, by contrast, has fewer than 1,000 full-time professional probation and parole officers. 
These officers are recruited and trained as professionals in counseling, but with an average of 
100,000 new qualifying convicts each year, they are too few to counsel clients individually. 
Their real work is to assign cases to approximately 48,000 volunteer parole officers throughout 
the country.

<p>	Each volunteer on average supervises only two convicts, and his primary responsibility is 
to help them rejoin their families and neighborhoods as well as to monitor their movements. 
These volunteers-cum-social workers are clearly getting the job done: Fewer than 4 percent of 
Japanese criminals who have been assigned to a volunteer officer will commit another crime 
within a year of their release on parole or probation.
<P>
	What is the Japanese secret in dealing so effectively with criminal offenders? Part of the 
answer is the selection process for parole and probation. To qualify for probation or parole in 
Japan, an offender must show remorse  for his crime and meet certain criteria that prevent the 
release of serious or habitual criminals.
<p>
	In Japan, acceptance by one's family is often the most important factor in an offender's 
rehabilitation, for the concept of shame is still alive and well in this society. A volunteer officer 
visits the offender's home to help his family overcome the shame of having a relative convicted 
of a crime. If family reunification is deemed impossible, the volunteer finds the offender a place 
at a halfway house or with friends.

<p>
	The next step is to help the offender find stable employment, so he may again become a 
functional member of his community. This is also considered essential to rehabilitation, as the 
importance of societal acceptance is second only to that of acceptance by one's family. After a 
residence and a job have been secured, the volunteer officer continues to meet with his charge 
once or twice a month to provide counsel and to monitor his progress.
<p>
	An appointment as a volunteer probation or parole officer requires no special  training or 
background; candidates must simply be respected and financially stable. Volunteers come from a 
range of occupations, but more than half are fishermen or farmers, religious leaders, housewives, 
and retired people. Ninety percent of the volunteers are at least 50 years old and 80 percent are 
men.
<p>
	Once appointed by the Ministry of Justice, a volunteer's term of service is two years, but most 
are reappointed several times. Almost half serve at least 10 years.
<p>
	Japan formally authorized its system of suspended prosecution in 1924, and codified the 
network of volunteers upon which it depended in 1950. Research conducted by Japan's Ministry 
of Justice shows that the success of volunteer probation officers lies in the individual attention 
they are able to give each offender; they are often seen as friends or mentors rather than authority 
figures. Many convicts, moved by the fact that someone has taken an interest in their well-being, 
feel an obligation to work toward rehabilitation.
<p>
	Could such a system work in the United States? America would need more than 1.75 million 
volunteers to achieve the same 2:1 ratio as Japan. Still, small caseload ratios are key to the 
successful supervision of offenders. "Most criminal activity is preceded by a progression of 
inappropriate behaviors," Varnum says. "If an agent spends time with an offender and sees the 
environment the offender lives in, it will be much easier for the agent to recognize the 
inappropriate behaviors that may lead to the offender's participation in further criminal activity. 
The Japanese parole model serves that purpose of real time supervision."
<p>
	It's true that Japanese society, particularly the role of the family, is quite different. Sharing in 
the public control of behavior, of course, is not unique to Japan. Many U.S. cities have volunteer 
organizations whose members patrol their communities or teach conflict resolution and job skills. 
Churches and mosques have begun to welcome and find employment for former criminals. It's 
time to go further, and experiment with the Japanese volunteer model.

HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY</h3></i>
<p>By Patrick F. Fagan<br>
William H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 420<br>
July 5, 1995<br></center><hr size=3 Width=30%>
<p>
    Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) has introduced a bill to reform the operation of America's
prisons. S. 930 requires inmates in federal prisons, and in the prisons of states receiving federal
monies under the 1994 crime bill for building new prisons, to work 48 hours and study 16 hours per
week. The legislation also repeals the social work requirements of last year's crime bill.
<p>
    Though many complain of overcrowding in prisons, Americans are far more concerned about
the early release of prisoners -- many inmates are released after serving only a small fraction of their
sentences. Despite the widespread feeling that a sentence imposed should be a sentence served, a
large portion of the nation's felonies are committed by those out on parole or on probation. Thus, the
overriding need is not relief from overcrowding, but more prisons to protect society from those who
harm other citizens and their property.
<p>
    Serious prison overcrowding urgently needs to be tackled. That means new facilities must be
built. But it is also important for taxpayers and lawmakers to realize that many prisons spend an
enormous amount of money on an extensive array of sports and recreational facilities for prisoners.
The use of these facilities is treated in Senator Shelby's bill as a privilege to be earned by completing
work and study, not as a right to accompany incarceration. These privileges -- some that many
taxpayers do not have for themselves -- include the use of weightlifting and bodybuilding equipment;
access to sports (basketball, football, baseball), recreation, and television; unmonitored phone calls;
instruction and training in martial arts (boxing, wrestling, judo, karate); the use of musical equipment;
in-cell cooking privileges (coffee pots and hot plates); permission to dress and groom in a manner
different from uniform prison standards; and access to equipment for publishing and broadcasting.
<p>
    Rarely are these facilities provided because the prison system wishes to do so. Judges
interpreting civil rights law impose these changes on officials through court order. John DiIulio,
professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, writes:  "What prosecutors and other
law enforcement officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in protecting
prisoners' rights. They have done so at the expense of making a mockery out of democratically
enacted laws. Some federal judges have made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing
changes in operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff assaults, a
dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for inmates, and the early release each year
of literally hundreds of thousands of violent or repeat criminals.1"
<p>
    Senator Shelby's bill would require prisoners to work and study for 64 hours per week, thus significantly
reducing the "free time" prisoners currently have to enjoy a host of amenities. The bill also requires that the food
prisoners are given not be superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to enlisted personnel in the United
States Army.
<p>
    A debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and punishment has swung back and forth in the
penology literature for over a century. The appeal of the Shelby proposal is that it has rehabilitation, education, work,
and punishment all in one package. Furthermore, the reform bill requires a prisoner's life to be similar to that of a
hardworking young taxpayer who holds a job and goes to college at night.
<p>
    The literature on the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts alone is weak at best. The literature on the
effectiveness of work and study is somewhat stronger. Some of the research difficulty comes from definitions and
understandings of rehabilitation. There are two dimensions to rehabilitation:  deep interior dispositions and developed
capacities. It is difficult even for friends to know, still less to change, the deep interior dispositions of others. It is
especially so for prison staff (even counselors and therapists) when they try to reach the prisoner. However the second
dimension of developing capacities is less dependent on changed interior dispositions. The person who works long and
hard acquires the capacity to work long and hard. The person who learns to work harder for more privileges acquires
an even greater capacity. And the person who studies develops his intellectual and operational capacities. All of these
will be of use to the prisoner when he regains his freedom.
<p>
    Sustained work for most people involves some form of suffering. At a minimum, a prisoner ought to
experience the normal suffering of the work week which the average citizen has to undergo.
<p>
    Many hardworking citizens do not have either the time or the money needed to join fitness clubs, take part in
sports, or receive training in the martial arts. They do not have easy access to many of the facilities made available to
prisoners. America's working poor have a life that is harder than that of many of federal and state prisoners. This
violates fundamental notions of justice and common sense.
<p>
    Many of the more luxurious facilities and privileges available to prisoners are beyond the reach of most low-income, law-abiding taxpayers and middle-income taxpaying parents with growing children. These privileges are in
place because of federal judges who dictate these facilities in the prisons. As DiIulio explains, the actions of these
judges undermine law enforcement. But by making work and study requirements part of federal law, the Shelby bill
makes it more difficult for judges to require prisons to provide such extensive facilities and privileges.
<p>
    The Shelby bill could be improved, and the principles of federalism better defended, if the bill addressed only
future prisons that states want to build with federal money. To require that all prisons in states  receiving
construction grants be run as Senator Shelby proposes would improve their method of operation, but
that requirement violates the central tenet of federalism -- leaving to the states what is not prohibited
by the  Constitution. With this modification, states which do not like the strings attached would not
have to take the  federal monies for future prisons and could provide unlimited television and karate
training if they wished. Those which agree with Senator Shelby's approach to running prisons could
apply for the money and build and manage their prisons along these lines. Senator Shelby expects
many states to use these federal monies and the federal requirements in the law as a way to break the
hold of micromanaging federal judges. If judges wanted to challenge this way of running prisons,
they would have to deal with Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court. They could not simply impose
court orders on prison officials.<p>

<p>
Francis A. Biunno, a Philadelphia trial judge, had just sentenced a murderer to death. He then turned to the courtroom, called on those present to sit down, and asked the public to reflect on the breakdown of our democratic system that had led to the killing.<p>
The murder in question was of a 21-year-old rookie police officer, Daniel Boyle, who stopped a stolen car in North Philadelphia. The driver of the stolen car, Edward Bracey, fired numerous shots through the windshield of the patrol car, hitting the young officer in the head. A police radio tape chillingly captured the fatal shots and the fallen officer's final words. A few days later Danny's father, veteran Philadelphia police detective Patrick Boyle, buried his only son.<p>
This tragedy didn't have to happen. Philadelphia police, Judge Biunno said, had previously arrested Bracey for car theft. Twice Bracey had been released without bail or supervision under terms of an order issued by a federal court. Twice Bracey had failed to show up for trialin fact, he was a fugitive from justice when he killed Officer Boyle. This killing wouldn't have taken place, Biunno suggested, if the federal court hadn't required the defendant's release.<p>
Criticism of a federal court on the part of a local trial judge is highly unusual. But Biunno's statement reflected the anger and frustration that officials in Philadelphia harbor toward a federal order that has wreaked havoc on their city's criminal-justice system. The court order to which Biunno referred places a cap on the number of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, and it sharply restricts the ability of judges to imprison defendants prior to trial.<p>
Last year, the city's judges were forced to release defendants in 15,000 cases. Thanks to the court order, the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justicedefendants who have been charged with a crime but do not even bother to show up for trial. Philadelphia police arrest the same criminals over and over again, only to see them immediately released. In the nine years since the order was approved by Judge Norma Shapiro, of the U.S. District Court, defendants released under federal court order have gone on to commit tens of thousands of crimesincluding thousands of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery.<p>
The federal court's order is technically called a "consent decree," because it was agreed to by a previous mayor of Philadelphia. But it no longer enjoys the consent of the governed. Philadelphia's elected leaders, including its present mayor, its district attorney, and most of its city council, are deeply opposed to the consent decree but powerless to overturn it. Philadelphia may be the home of the Liberty Bell, but the federal consent decree is making a mockery of the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.The Philadelphia prisons, which house defendants before trial and sentenced prisoners, have been the subject of various class-action lawsuits since 1972. Past conditions in the prisons have been unacceptable. Over the years, many experts have observed inadequate medical care that has led to the death of inmates, unsanitary food preparation, vermin infestation, and poor plumbing, ventilation, and heating.<p>
In 1986, these conditions prompted inmates at an old, decrepit facility called Holmesburg Prison to file a lawsuit against then-mayor W. Wilson Goode. The mayor decided to settle the case rather than go to trial. The resulting federal consent decree, agreed to by Goode's lawyers, did nothing to address medical care or other conditions in the city's prisons. Rather, it sought to limit the number of prisoners, and, more important, forbade pretrial detention for defendants accused of broad categories of crime. The architects of the plan apparently presumed that reducing the number of prisoners would improve the prison environment for the remaining inmates.<p>
Instead of individualized bail review, with Philadelphia judges considering a criminal defendant's dangerousness to others or his risk of flight, the consent decree requires a "charge-based" system of prison admissions. Suspects charged with so-called "non-violent" crimes, including stalking, car jacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges, are not subject to pretrial detention.<p>
In determining pretrial detention, Philadelphia judges can no longer consider a defendant's prior record, his history of failing to appear in court, his mental-health history, his ties to the community, or his drug or alcohol dependency. These factors become completely irrelevant. A major drug dealer carrying a loaded Uzi and a plane ticket out of the country cannot be detained before trial in Philadelphia.<p>
As a result of this system, Philadelphia has become an especially attractive location for drug dealing. Narcotics agents assigned to the international airport routinely apprehend (and are forced to release) drug couriers, who have been assured that carrying over $100,000 of marijuana to Philadelphia is risk free. One newly arrested drug dealer, knowing that he would be released in a matter of hours, cheerfully gave his pretrial bail interviewer a phone number where he could be reached-in Cali, Colombia. <p>
Another drug dealer, Walter Lewis, unwittingly schooled undercover narcotics officers on the benefits of dealing drugs in Philadelphia. Lewis had been awaiting trial in Philadelphia for drug dealing but had already been released because of the federal consent decree. Undercover narcotics agents from neighboring Montgomery County arranged a narcotics deal on City Line Avenue, the street dividing Montgomery County from Philadelphia. When Lewis arrived, he tried to convince the undercover officers to move the drug deal to the Philadelphia side of the street. He carefully explained that they could all be sent to jail if they stayed in Montgomery County. After the officers refused to move, Lewis mistakenly let greed guide him. He completed the deal, the officers immediately arrested him, and he went straight to jail, where he remained until trial. If the deal had occurred in Philadelphia, he would have been released in a matter of hours. <p>
The consent decree has crippled Philadelphia's already struggling criminal-justice system. Once criminals knew that they could not be detained prior to trial no matter how many times they failed to appear for court, Philadelphia began recording unprecedented fugitive rates. A study conducted by John Goldkamp and Kay Harris, nationally recognized experts on the bail process, found, for example, that 76 percent of all Philadelphia drug dealers become fugitives within 90 days of their arrest. Nationally, only 26 percent of drug dealers become fugitives within one year of their arrest. By comparison, only 3 percent of Philadelphia defendants charged with aggravated assaulta crime not subject to the release provisions of the federal consent decreefail to appear for court.<p>
The skyrocketing fugitive rate has produced a system with more defendants in fugitive status than awaiting trial. In the first six months of 1994, over 11,000 new bench warrants (the arrest document issued when a criminal defendant does not appear for a court hearing) were issued for defendants released under the federal consent decrees, representing 74 percent of all the bench warrants issued during this period. Under the consent decree, the number of fugitives in Philadelphia has nearly tripled from 18,000 to almost 50,000, equivalent to a year's worth of criminal prosecutions. And no wonder: Under the consent decree, state courts are powerless to compel a defendant's appearance in court.<p>
Unfortunately for Philadelphians, the defendants released because of the consent decree do not lay lowthey just keep on committing new crimes. In an 18-month period (1993 and the first six months of 1994), Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because of the consent decree. These defendants were charged with 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.<p>
These crimes cannot all be attributed to the federal consent decree; some defendants would have been released under normal Pennsylvania procedures. But apparently half or more of these crimes could have been prevented. Goldkamp and Harris found that pretrial detainees released under the consent decree committed crimes at more than twice the rate of defendants released under state-court bail programs. Within 90 days of release, 18 percent of federally released defendants were rearrested for new crimes, compared with an 8 percent rearrest figure for comparable state bail programs. <p>
Retailers complain of a sharp increase in shoplifting and robberies by criminals immune from incarceration. In April, Charles Pembroke was released for the fifth time in 1995 because of the Philadelphia prison cap. In the last six months, Philadelphia police have arrested Pembroke three times for retail theft, once for robbing a pharmacy with a starter pistol while threatening to kill the victims, and once for drug dealing. Pembroke has failed to appear for court seven times and, as of this writing, is a fugitive on three of his cases. Philadelphia's criminal-justice system just keeps seeing the same defendants over and over again, but can't do anything until they commit a crime so serious that the consent decree finally permits the prison to admit them.<p>
The consent decree also weakens the effectiveness of programs for criminal defendants who never would have been detained prior to trial. State judges are no longer allowed to sanction those criminal defendants who violate conditions of bail, fail to appear for trial, or commit new crimes. State-court bail programs have atrophied into virtual non-existence. Conditional-release programs providing drug treatment, aimed at lifting new offenders out of their recently acquired lives of drugs and crime, are forced to wait for offenders to become serious criminals with a long-term addiction. <p>
The case of Frederick Hightower vividly demonstrates the absurdity of the consent decree. Hightower was a trained helicopter mechanic from a solid family who became addicted to crack at age 29. He quickly turned to burglaries.<p>
Given Hightower's age, lack of prior criminal-justice contacts, and long-term ties to the community, the local court system (had it remained in charge of the pretrial detention process) probably would have released him without bail for his first two burglaries. But by the time he was arrested for his third burglary, the local judge would have suspected a drug problem, sent him to jail, and permitted his conditional release (again without posting bail) a few days later into an in-patient drug treatment program. If this had worked (admittedly an optimistic outlook) and he had remained in treatment, he would have been a prime candidate for a sentence of probation with the condition of continued drug treatment.<p>
But the federal consent decree wouldn't allow the local criminal-justice system to operate. Without the threat of pretrial incarceration, Hightower wouldn't enter a drug treatment program. Philadelphia wasn't permitted to keep Hightower in jail until he was finally arrested for his 10th burglary. Hightower now was no longer a candidate for probation. Instead he received a 10-year maximum sentence, and must serve a minimum of two and a half years before he is eligible for parole.<p>
The cost of this folly: numerous crime victims with substantial financial losses (and he surely wasn't caught every time); prison bed space occupied longer (a few years, at a cost of approximately $25,000 a year, instead of a few days); increased court costs (each one of his new cases involved police witnesses, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and court personnel), less chance of drug rehabilitation (the treatment came later in his addiction); and loss of tax revenues (Hightower was a skilled, employed taxpayer). <p>
The Philadelphia Federal Courthouse overlooks Independence Hall, the cradle of American liberty and the Constitution. How ironic, then, that the federal court's consent decree tramples on the right of Philadelphians to a democratic political system.<p>
Mayor Ed Rendell and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, both elected Democrats, won office pledging to do what they could to overturn the prison-cap and prisoner-release provisions of the consent decree. Philadelphia's top leaders, including most of the city council, are united in their view that the federal court's rules on pretrial release of defendants are a serious threat to public safety, effectively decriminalizing property crime in Philadelphia, and harming the financial viability of the city. But the federal court has rejected all challenges to the consent decree, and shows no indications of ceding oversight over the issue. Philadelphia's elected leaders are powerless to change agreements made by a prior administration, and so powerless to set their own criminal-justice priorities.<p>
Our democratic system presumes that policies made by today's elected leaders, whether by legislation, regulation, or policy statements, can be altered by their successors in office. Through periodic elections, the public can throw out arrogant public officials who try to insulate their governmental vision from change or from the will of the electorate. Philadelphians do not consent to the consent decree that is destroying their criminal justice system. It's time that Philadelphia's elected leaders be allowed to do the job for which they were elected. Isn't that what America's independence was all about?

<P>	   <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n New Year's Eve 1975, after an evening of taking LSD and watching cop 
shows on television, 15-year-old Raul Meza showed up at a convenience store near his 
house in Austin, Texas, armed with a deer rifle. Meza emptied the cash register, then 
marched the clerk, a 20-year-old college student named Derly Ramirez, into the walk-in 
freezer. Meza shot him in the back and left him for dead.</P>
<P>	Ramirez recovered to testify against the man who wounded him. Meza received a 
20-year sentence, and served five years before getting out on parole.</P>
<P>	On January 3, 1982, months after his release, 21-year-old Raul Meza abducted 
Kendra Page, a third-grader, as she rode her bicycle near her home in southeast Austin. 
Meza tortured, raped, and strangled the girl, then left her body behind a dumpster. Three 
days later, he surrendered to the police. Meza received 30 years for the killing.</P>
<P>	While behind bars, Meza racked up demerits for various infractions, and four 
years were added to his sentence after guards found a knife in his cell. Meza came up for 
parole seven times, and each time it was denied.</P>
<P>	By 1993, however, prison authorities could keep Meza no longer. Under Texas 
law, he had accumulated enough credit for good behavior to qualify automatically for 
release. The state freed him under mandatory supervision, a conditional release not unlike 
parole that can be granted without the consent of the parole board.</P>
<P>	No matter how notorious, most felons leave prison with little fanfare. They re-
enter society quietly and soon become anonymous. Some begin new and honest lives. 
Many others, freed from supervision and accountable to no one, commit new crimes. 
Raul Meza might have regained his freedom in the same way. But he never got the 
chance. One hundred and forty miles from Meza's Huntsville prison cell, an Austin 
newspaper editor decided to make him famous.</P>
<P>	In 15 years of covering crimes, Jerry White, the city editor of the <I>Austin 
American-Statesman</I>, had watched scores of criminals disappear from public view after 
sentencing. Most of them left prison years before their sentences expired, often to rob, 
rape, or kill again. "It became apparent," says White, "that even though these folks are 
sentenced and sent away, the story doesn't really end." White began compiling a list of 
inmates who were "fairly notorious" in Austin. Every few months, he called the 
department of corrections to ask when inmates on his list would be eligible for parole.</P>
<P>	In June 1993, the department of corrections confirmed that Meza was due to be 
released soon. Using the state's Open Records Act, the newspaper petitioned Texas's 
attorney general and found where Meza planned to live. An article ran on the front page 
of the Sunday paper eight days before Meza's release. The headline read, "`Nothing's 
Going To Stop It': Killer of 8-Year-Old About to be Freed."</P>
<P>    In a city of about 465,000 people, the story reached 240,000 homes and provoked an 
outpouring of media attention. Film crews greeted Meza as he walked out of the state 
prison and followed him for months. Publicity, mostly bad, seemed to trail him 
everywhere. Corrections officials moved him from town to town, but in each residents 
and local politicians protested his presence. Colin Amann, a Houston lawyer who 
represented the killer after his release, says angry citizens "kicked him in the butt from 
one end of Texas to the other."</P>
<P>	For much of 1993, Texans kept on kicking. Over several months, he was shuttled 
between towns and cities all over the state. Of the 276 halfway houses that were asked to 
accept Meza, 271 refused. "Every town he went to," says Amann, "people were just 
screaming and yelling. Lots of small communities went out and bitched about it. A lot. 
And it happened every time they'd move him, they had the same outcry."</P>
<P>	In August, the parole division placed Meza on his grandparents' farm, west of San 
Antonio. On August 31, local sheriffs charged Meza with "terroristic threatening" and 
disorderly conduct for bullying his elderly grandparents. A judge later dismissed the 
charges, but the incident made nearly every newspaper in Texas. At least 1,000 local 
residents signed a petition asking the state to move Meza again. The parole division sent 
him to Austin.</P>
<P>	His new neighbors protested, held rallies, carried signs. A few moved away. The 
furor subsided a bit when the father of the murdered girl publicly called for citizens to 
give Meza the chance to start a new life. He moved into his mother's house and found a 
job. In the first 10 months of 1994, the <I>American-Statesman</I> ran more than 20 stories on 
Meza. In August 1994, he was arrested for violating the curfew provision of his parole, 
and he returned to the state prison in Huntsville.</P>
<P>	At the time Meza was taken into custody, there were more than 116,000 parolees 
in Texas, 15,000 of whom had outstanding warrants for parole violations. Yet the 
governor's fugitive squad focused its energies on Meza, the most famous one. And while 
parolees in Texas routinely get three chances to break parole before being arrested, Meza 
was taken into custody after only one violation. His supporters cried foul. But the citizens 
of Texas were the better for it.</P>
<P>   Meza needed all the attention he could get. As a group, violent sex offenders have an 
extraordinarily high rate of recidivism. In Texas, about one-third of convicted rapists are 
arrested for new crimes within two years of getting out on parole. Ordinarily, parole 
officers are not able to supervise sex offenders carefully. But because they learned from 
news reports where Meza lived, neighbors were able to keep their children out of his 
path. Relentless publicity forced a troubled parole system to work effectively. And 
information disseminated by the press helped to create thousands of civilian parole 
officers--watchful neighbors who kept an eye on him.</P>
<P> 	Publicity, however, is a blunt instrument, and others were unintentionally 
bludgeoned by Meza's fame. His relatives were humiliated. His victim's parents saw their 
tragedy replayed in the press. And Meza himself was hounded across the state. Nobody 
knows how such attention may have retarded his rehabilitation, but it may not matter. 
Despite the burdens imposed on him and his family--or, more likely, because of them--
Meza did not kill another child while out of prison.</P>
<P>	Even Meza's attorney, a self-described liberal, believes the publicity was worth 
the cost. "I think everybody should know when a parolee is coming to live in their 
neighborhood," says Colin Amann. "That's why crime is committed, because people 
don't know who the criminals are. Once they get out, let's let the entire world know 
where they are going to live. Let's let the community have some responsibility for 
keeping its thumb on them."</P>
<P>	More and more communities are clamoring for that very responsibility. Meza's 
case illustrates what most people already sense: Citizens who know their neighbors will 
be safer than those who don't. Study after study has shown anonymity to be a factor in 
many crimes. Simply put, criminals are more apt to commit crimes in neighborhoods 
where they do not know the neighbors, and where the neighbors do not know one 
another. As James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein explain in <I>Crime and Human 
Nature</I>, their expansive survey of criminology, "the more rapid the population turnover in 
an area, the higher the victimization rate, even after controlling for the racial and age 
composition."</P>
<P>	Conversely, close-knit communities tend to be resistant to predatory crime. A 
criminal is less likely to commit crimes where the neighbors recognize him, particularly if 
they know that he has a criminal record.</P>
<P>	Statistics explain why citizens have a vested interest in knowing who in their 
neighborhood has been convicted of serious offenses. Ex-cons commit a staggering 
amount of crime. As John DiIulio of Princeton University has pointed out, "within three 
years of sentencing, while still on probation, nearly half of all probationers are placed 
behind bars for a new crime or abscond." Nationally, recidivism for parolees is about the 
same as for probationers. DiIulio cites a revealing study of Florida convicts:</P>
<P>	"Between 1987 and 1991, about 87 percent of the 147,000 felons released from 
Florida prisons were released early. Fully one-third of these parolees committed a new 
crime. At points in time when they would have been incarcerated had they not been 
released early, these parolees committed nearly 26,000 new crimes, including some 4,656 
new crimes of violence--346 murders, 185 sexual assaults, 2,369 robberies, and 1,754 
other violent offenses."</P>
<P>	Not only are felons on supervised release dangerous, but there are a lot of them. In 
1993, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a total of 671,000 Americans were on 
parole or probation. There is considerable evidence that many parole and probation 
officers are responsible for far more offenders than they can possibly supervise, even 
those housed under one roof. A investigation in 1993 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 
that one of every six convicted felons placed in Colorado halfway houses escaped. That 
year, the study found, 526 felons walked away from halfway houses and into the 
surrounding neighborhoods. Seven of the escapees were convicted murderers. "In most 
cases," the paper concluded, "no one looked for them."</P>
<P>	Informed neighbors don't always just keep offenders from committing crimes; 
sometimes they can help ex-cons straighten out. Mike Elsworth got out of prison in 
Washington, D.C., for the last time on Halloween 1990, after serving two years for 
selling cocaine. Elsworth, who was paroled to the same part of town where he grew up, 
credits his neighbors for helping him keep his record clean since his release. Although he 
was shunned by at least one woman on his block, other "neighbors were supportive and 
understanding of me trying to do better once I got out. They knew I was looking for a job, 
and they would tell me about places that they knew were hiring, and some of them would 
tell me if I needed anything to come on by." Three months after his release, with the 
encouragement of his neighbors, Elsworth found a job.</P>
<P>	Elsworth says his neighbors gave him the help and attention his parole officers 
did not. In two years, Elsworth reported to five different officers. "It was like, every three 
months I had a new one," he says. "I don't know why. They really had little or no 
concern about me as a person." Elsworth met with his parole officer for 10 to 15 minutes 
every few weeks. But he saw his neighbors every day, which ultimately, he says, made all 
the difference.</P>
<P>	Of course, not all neighborhoods would take advantage of more information about 
felons. In some parts of cities, particularly in poor areas where citizens tend to live 
chaotic lives, neighbors often know who is on parole and don't care. Nor would giving 
neighbors the names and addresses of all newly released felons always benefit the felons 
themselves. Critics have long charged that releasing the names of parolees and 
probationers to the public would make it more difficult for convicted criminals to start 
successful new lives once they get out of prison. A federal judge recently struck down 
parts of "Megan's Law," a New Jersey statute requiring released sex offenders to tell 
their communities where they live. In his decision, Judge Nicholas Politan said the 
notification requirement amounted to a form of punishment, and cannot be added to 
penalties already in place before the law was passed in 1994. Requiring a convicted felon 
to notify his neighbors upon release, he wrote, would constitute a "lifelong albatross," 
and would ruin an ex-con's ability to "return to a normal, private, law-abiding life in the 
community." Judge Politan might be right. Ultimately, however, much of what would 
happen if the names of parolees were publicized is conjecture. As it stands, the identities 
of released criminals often remain shrouded in state and federal privacy laws. The Federal 
Privacy Act of 1974, for instance, generally bars authorities from divulging the names 
and addresses of parolees released from federal prisons. Most states, wary of civil-rights 
lawsuits brought by released felons, have adopted similar laws. While the intent of such 
statutes may be noble, their effect has sometimes been devastating.</P>
<P>	Last summer, the residents of Red Hook, a small town in upstate New York, paid 
the price for having an unknown felon in their midst. In June, Richard Moran, a lifelong 
criminal from the Bronx, was released from Rikers Island, where he had spent the 
previous three months on a parole violation, and placed in Red Hook's only homeless 
shelter. No one knew his criminal record. No one was watching.</P>
<P>	Had Moran's record become public, Tommy McCauliff, a 29-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, might still be alive. On a Sunday afternoon in July, McCauliff emerged 
from his apartment, staggered across the street, and bled to death on the sidewalk from a 
knife wound in his back.</P>
<P>	Police picked up Moran and charged him with second-degree murder. He was 
later convicted.</P>
<P>	By the time he came to Red Hook, Moran had spent close to half of his 43 years 
behind bars. First arrested in New York City for armed robbery in 1969, he went on to 
amass 26 different criminal charges, including several violent felonies. Within days of 
being released, Moran made his way to Shelter Plus, a state-financed boarding house for 
vagrants in Red Hook, 90 miles north. Under circumstances that are still not clear, he met 
Tommy McCauliff.</P>
<P>	When an inmate with two or more convictions is released from a state prison in 
New York, within 48 hours corrections officials must notify the police in the town to 
which he is headed. Rikers Island, however, is not a state prison, but a jail run by New 
York City. Authorities there were not required to notify police in Red Hook that Moran 
was on his way to their town. And they didn't.</P>
<P>	The state's department of social services in nearby Poughkeepsie was the only 
agency that knew about Moran's arrival in Red Hook, and New York's confidentiality 
laws require social workers to keep secret the criminal histories of their clients.</P>
<P>	"Anything in our records is confidential," says John Battistoni, the county's 
commissioner of social services. "Parolees just come in like anyone else. If they're 
without a place to go, we're required to give them shelter." Only a court order, he says, 
can force the department to divulge the names of the parolees it places in homeless 
shelters. A call from the local police department will not suffice. For employees who 
break confidentiality rules, says Battistoni, "the penalties could be severe. You'd be 
subjecting yourself and your county to all sorts of suits. It's tough stuff."</P>
<P>	All things considered, says Battistoni, he is not bothered by the secrecy. "I 
suppose people shouldn't be branded," he offers. "People are saying they'd like to know 
if a criminal is placed in their neighborhood. I often wonder what they would do with the 
information if they had it. Put a 24-hour tail on the guy?"</P>
<P>	Lisa Murray has no doubt what she would do with such information. "I would 
keep an eye on that person," she says, "and I would know if that person was near my 
child, if it was a rapist or a child molester, to get my kid away." Murray is one of five 
Red Hook women who formed a group called Concerned Citizens for a Safe Community 
after McCauliff's death. The group advocates changing the confidentiality laws they 
believe were partly responsible for the killing.</P>
<P>	Murray points out that Richard Moran is not the only criminal to move into the 
homeless shelter without the town's knowledge. Since McCauliff's death, police have 
arrested two other residents of Shelter Plus for selling drugs. "Whenever somebody gets a 
DWI or commits a robbery, it's in the paper before they're even convicted of the crime," 
she says. "So why not have a criminal who's already been convicted of a crime and 
released from prison be put in the paper saying where he's going to live?"</P>
<P>	A county legislator named Woody Klose quickly sponsored a resolution requiring 
local police to be notified whenever felons are placed in homeless shelters. Steve Saland, 
a state senator, sponsored a bill that would force corrections officials to notify towns 
whenever a parolee is about to be released into their midst. Unlike the statute in place, the 
new law would apply to jails as well as state prisons. It would require authorities to notify 
the mayor and the chief of police of the town to which the parolee is headed, as well as 
officials in the town where the crime was committed. The written statement would 
include the ex-con's physical description, his known aliases, and his criminal record. It 
would also contain his new home address. Towns would have to post the information in a 
public place, such as a bulletin board in city hall, in post offices, or in advertisements in 
local newspapers. Released offenders would be required to report to local authorities for a 
period of 10 years each time they moved to a new address in New York.</P>
<P>	Saland's notification law would apply only to paroled sex criminals, repeat 
violent offenders, and those convicted of three or more felonies. Saland says the law 
would not prevent parolees from committing new crimes. But it might help neighbors to 
protect themselves from released criminals. "All you can do is provide notice," he says. 
After that, "it's up to the community."</P>
<P>	Tommy McCauliff's death prompted New York politicians to take a new look at 
an old debate. For years, lawmakers have tried to balance the requirements of public 
safety with a belief that stigmatizing released felons makes rehabilitating them more 
difficult. Many states have compromised by requiring parolees and convicted criminals to 
register their addresses with law-enforcement officials, but not with neighbors or 
community groups. States that do provide for community notification when a felon is 
released nearly always limit the notification to cases involving sex offenders.
<P>	Most states that have such laws leave their application to the discretion of law 
enforcement officers. Often police departments get to decide which sex offenders 
constitute a threat to their neighbors. Although the state of Washington allows police to 
release photographs of and information about convicted sex offenders to community 
groups, and news outlets, the law is not always used. In the first 10 months of 1994, for 
instance, county police in Spokane notified the public only once of a paroled sex 
offender, though several were released into the area. Carol Dorris, who follows crime 
legislation for the National Victim's Center, says it is not unusual to see effective laws 
passed, then ignored. "It's fine to put in statutes and legislate something," she says, "but 
to enforce them is a lot harder to do."</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, recent developments show that concerned citizens have several 
outlets for civic action:</P>
<H3>Legislative Action</H3>
<P> The inability of probation officers to effectively track offenders 
argues for comprehensive notification laws--let the community provide the surveillance 
that the state cannot or will not. So far, such laws exist only in theory. For fear of 
destroying an ex-con's chances of success after release, no state has passed laws that 
would give the public the names and addresses of all parolees and probationers.</P>
<P>	Louisiana, however, has taken the lead in warning communities about released 
sex offenders. In 1992, the legislature passed two laws that ensure sex offenders will 
never again live anonymously in Louisiana. Or, as a later revision to the laws put it, 
"Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy." 
In fact, a person convicted of one of the state's 18 sex offenses can expect practically no 
privacy at all.</P>
<P>	The two laws and their amendments are vast in scope. No later than 10 days 
before a sex offender gets out of prison, corrections officials must send letters warning of 
his impending release to his victims, witnesses who testified against him, and the sheriff 
of the parish (county) to which he is going. Once he gets out, a sex offender must register 
with the sheriff and provide his fingerprints, his photograph, his social-security number, 
and any aliases he has used. The ex-con must also give the sheriff a description of his 
offense, including the date and place he committed it, and his home address. Offenders 
who move within the state of Louisiana have 10 days to re-register. The process 
continues for 10 years after their release.</P>
<P>	If his victim was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the offender must notify his 
neighbors as well. Twice within his first month out of prison, he must purchase an 
advertisement in his local newspaper. The ads must reveal his name, his address, and his 
offense. Descriptions of the crimes must be written in language ordinary citizens can 
understand; statute numbers do not suffice. To verify that it meets these specifications, 
the ad must pass muster with a parole officer.</P>
<P>	One such classified advertisement, which appeared in the <I>New Orleans Times-
Picayune</I> on May 8, 1994, is typical of the genre. "John Jones of 701 Teche St.," it said, 
"was convicted of a Sex Offense, Simple Rape." Another, on June 10, 1994, advertised, 
"I, Jim Davis, was convicted of molestation of a juvenile." [<I>Policy Review</I> has changed 
the names.] Other ads placed in the paper in June mentioned carnal knowledge, sexual 
battery, and indecent behavior with a juvenile.</P>
<P>	Once he has notified the larger community of his crime, an offender must tell his 
neighbors about it. The parolee must send letters or postcards with the same 
information--name, address, and offense--to every house within three blocks of his 
home. In cities, this usually means 36 square blocks and hundreds of houses. A parolee 
who lives in a rural area must send letters to everyone within a one-mile radius of his 
house.</P>
<P>	Finally, a sex offender whose victim was under 18 must contact the 
superintendent of the public-school district in his parish, as well as the principals of any 
private or parochial schools in the area.</P>
<P> 	If it chooses, a parole board also "may order any other form of notice which it 
deems appropriate, including but not limited to signs, handbills, bumper stickers, or 
clothing labeled to that effect." All of the expenses involved in the notification, such as 
stamps, envelopes, and advertising fees--not to mention any specially-labeled clothing 
the parole board may require--must be borne by the parolee. If at any time he fails to 
meet any requirement, an offender may be returned to prison.</P>
<H3>Citizen Journalists</H3>
<P>When John Roger, president of the Bayview Civic League in 
Norfolk, Virginia, asked the local police department to release the names of parolees who 
had moved into his neighborhood, it refused. Undeterred, Roger sought information at the 
other end of the criminal justice system: arrestees.</P>
<P>	Unlike the addresses of released felons, arrest records are publicly available from 
the police department. Every month, the league's newsletter, <I>Bayview Bylines</I>, publishes 
the name, race, and home address of each person taken into custody by the police within 
the boundaries of the Bayview neighborhood. Periodically, in a feature called "Pervert 
Alert," Roger also provides descriptions of flashers, peeping Toms, and other unsavory 
characters seen in the area. To pay for printing, local merchants buy advertising space in 
the newsletter. "Want to know why we do it?" he asks. "It's simple. We live here. We 
believe our members have a right to know what's going on."</P>
<P>	Though he prints only 4,000 copies of the newsletters, Roger is confident they 
reach many more people. Residents read it, he says, not only out of a fear of crime, but to 
"find if somebody they know has been arrested." The publicity can have consequences. 
Landlords, says Roger, scan the names of arrestees. "If it happens to be one of their 
tenants, they get rid of him."</P>
<P>	Although it remains difficult in most states to learn the whereabouts of parolees, 
there are other ways citizens can gather information on potentially dangerous criminals. 
In July 1994, John Johansen, a financial consultant in Arlington, Virginia, published the 
first issue of <I>Crime Prevention Bulletin</I>, a quarterly newspaper with a circulation of 
30,000. Police departments in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia 
cooperated with Johansen, giving him the photographs and last known addresses of 
fugitives in the area. Johansen printed the mug shots, some beneath headlines like 
"Wanted for Murder." The papers were distributed throughout the area by members of 
neighborhood organizations.</P>
<P>	The Bulletin was an instant success. In many cases, fugitives were still living in 
the same areas, even at the same addresses, amid neighbors who had no idea they were 
wanted by the law. Local police did not have the resources to track down each of the 
fugitives. But they could respond to tips provided by citizens who recognized their 
neighbors in the <I>Bulletin</I>. In its first six months, police credited Johansen's newspaper 
with the arrests of 15 fugitives in Washington alone. Six of them were suspected 
murderers.</P>
<H3>Do-It-Yourself Advertising</H3>
<P> Sanford "Sandy" Krasnoff, the president of Victims and 
Citizens Against Crime, in Lousiana, says his group devotes much of its energy to 
making certain the state's sex-crimes laws achieve their desired effect. Every Saturday 
morning, the flamboyant Krasnoff, who at various times in his career has been a New 
Orleans cop, a lawyer, and a manager of professional prize fighters, hosts a radio show 
called "Crime Watch." Each week, during three hours of air-time donated by the station, 
Krasnoff announces the names, addresses, and crimes of all sex offenders released on 
parole or probation in Louisiana in the previous week. Krasnoff gets the information 
directly from the parole and pardons board.</P>
<P>	Krasnoff's group also monitors offenders after their release. A volunteer, whom 
Krasnoff refers to as "the sex lady," scans newspapers for advertisements placed by 
parolees under the new law. When he saw that some of the ads were "coming out in 
mumbo-jumbo, referring to act numbers and statutes instead of telling people exactly 
what they were charged with," Krasnoff wrote a letter to the department of corrections, 
which promptly instructed parole officers to reject such ads.</P>
<P>	According to William T. Price, the deputy director of the state's adult probation 
and parole division, the state's new sex-offender laws have not prompted violence from 
the public. In a few cases, people moved upon learning that a child molester had come to 
their neighborhood. But, he says, nobody has yet thrown a fire bomb.</P>
<P>	Price does worry that the laws may be too broad, covering not only child 
molestation and forcible rape, but also non-predatory crimes like bigamy. "If you can 
attach the concept of sex to it," says Price, a crime probably falls under the rubric of the 
new laws.</P>
<P>	For all its willingness to publicize the names and addresses of sex offenders, the 
state of Louisiana still guards information about other parolees carefully. Apart from sex 
criminals, the state's probation and parole division refuses to give out the home addresses 
of the convicts it supervises. The concern, says Price, is that some people, such as bill 
collectors, could put the information to unwholesome purposes. "We don't want to get 
into that business," he says.</P>
<P>	In the fall of 1994, residents of Warwick, Rhode Island, a Providence suburbwere 
desperate to publicize the whereabouts of a man named Craig Price. Five years before, 
Price had admitted stabbing to death four of his Warwick neighbors. Because he was 
technically a juvenile when he committed the murders, he was sentenced to a juvenile 
detention center until age 21. Incensed by Price's crime, a Warwick police captain named 
Kevin Collins organized citizens to fight his release. "This guy had butchered four 
people," says Collins, "knowing that when he gets out at 21, he can go out and obtain a 
gun, [or] work in a day-care center."</P>
<P>	Collins decided to keep Craig Price from ever becoming anonymous. He 
recounted Price's story on radio and television shows. He sent press releases to papers 
around the country. When he heard that Price planned to move to Florida upon release, 
Collins hired an airplane to tow a sign over Miami Beach. The banner read, "Killer of 4 
Craig Price Moving Here? No Police Record!" Similar messages floated over Chicago 
and beaches in Los Angeles and New Jersey.</P>
<P>	Once Price is released, Collins says, he will not be able to tell the public where the 
killer lives. "Once he gets out there--like if he moves into your neighborhood," says 
Collins, "if I went around there knocking on doors, I think they're going to come after me 
on a civil-rights violation." Collins says the memory of the man's crimes may be enough 
to keep Price from killing again in Rhode Island. "Hey, my attitude is, he deserves to be a 
prisoner of public opinion."</P>
<H3>Exercising the Right to Know</H3>
<P> Although no Rhode Island statute would prevent Collins 
from publicizing Craig Price's address once the killer is released, doing so would be 
unwise. As a police officer, Collins could wind up in federal court under Title VII of the 
United States Code. Passed in 1964 as part of Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights legislation, 
the law allows individuals to bring civil action against government officials who conspire 
to deprive them of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the 
law liberally, and it is conceivable that Collins could be found to have violated Price's 
right to privacy, a protection some judges believe emanates from the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>	The state's privacy act prohibits government officials from releasing a parolee's 
medical records, or information about his drug or alcohol treatment. But no regulations 
prohibit the state from giving out his home address to citizens who ask. The privacy law 
does not bind Rhode Islanders who do not work for the government. Says James Jerue, 
chairman of the state's parole board, if Craig Price were released on parole in Rhode 
Island, any citizen could find out where he lived. Not that Jerue thinks citizens would try 
to learn. "It has never happened," he says. "No one has ever asked for a home address."</P>
<P>	Citizens have a right to know when potentially dangerous criminals are released 
into their neighborhoods. But they also have an obligation to make the effort required to 
find the information. And there are many ways to get it.</P>
<UL><LI>  In places like Rhode Island, citizens can simply ask the state for the names and 
addresses of parolees.
<LI>In states with strict privacy laws, such as New York, citizens can lobby the legislature 
for legal reform.
<LI>Individuals can ask newspapers to publish the results of every parole hearing in the 
state, as well as the names of every person arrested and convicted for a serious crime. 
Once such information becomes public, it can be spread to a wider audience on 
community bulletin boards and computer services.
<LI>Citizens' groups can apply political pressure to police departments to release the names 
and addresses of those arrested and of those being released from prison into the area.
<LI>  No citizens' group should underestimate the power of a well-placed news story to make 
police departments more accommodating to its requests. If public scrutiny helps to keep 
criminals honest, it can have the same effect on public officials.</UL>
<P>	More than anything, concerned citizens must be willing to spend time and energy 
gathering information on known criminals. Which means they must be nosy. An informed 
community is not necessarily the most private, but it will be the safest.</P>

<H3> A Felon's Perspective (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	It is clear that social-service providers cannot supply all the supervision many ex-
cons need to stay out of trouble. Neighbors can help. Lewis, a 29-year-old native of 
Washington, D.C., has spent a large portion of his life as a professional burglar. Like 
many current and former criminals, he understands that it is vital to know whether 
neighbors have criminal pasts. "People got to know," Lewis says. "If you don't know 
who's living around you, you're trusting everybody. Most of the people that I know, 
including myself, we want everybody to trust us, because once you get trusted you can do 
basically anything you want to do."</P> 
<P>	As a young man, Lewis broke into houses on his own street. Had the neighbors 
known about his criminal tendencies, he says, "it would have never happened, because 
they would have been better prepared. You'd be surprised at the people who leave 
windows open and go to work. Some people are even stupid enough to get drunk around 
you and leave their keys."</P>
<P>	At 17, Lewis was arrested for several burglaries. He was convicted and sent to 
Lorton prison, outside of Washington, first to the juvenile wing, then to the adult facility. 
By the time he got out on parole, three years later, he had not been reformed, but he had 
become considerably wiser: He stopped breaking into his neighbors' houses. "Quite a 
few neighbors" knew about his burglary convictions, he says. "Basically, it was a `we're 
going to wait and see' type of thing. I was watched and that discouraged me from 
anything."</P>
<P>	Instead, Lewis says, he looked in other neighborhoods, especially crowded parts 
of town where neighbors would not recognize him. And he always went on foot. "You 
never drive a different car to a neighborhood because everybody notices it. If people see 
that different car, they'll wait `til you get out of it." Lewis estimates he burgled nearly 50 
houses before being sent back to prison (on drug-dealing charges, not burglary).</P>
<P>	It has been several years since Lewis finished his last term in prison. He is 
married and lives in Prince George's County, Maryland. He says he has no regular job, 
but works on and off for a temporary agency. His current neighbors do not know about 
his burglary convictions, and sometimes Lewis is tempted to steal again. "The urge will 
hit when I'm broke," he says. "Sometimes when it gets a little tight with money and she 
starts bitching, you start thinking what you can do for money. And you think, `I could 
always do what I used to do.' "</P>
<P>	Although Lewis has chosen not to tell his neighbors about his criminal past, he 
does not believe other criminals should have the same choice. "Why not alert people to 
the fact that you got a known criminal in the neighborhood, you got a burglar living next 
door to you?" he asks. "The burglar who lives next door to you will get you sooner than 
you think, especially if you don't know, because he can see you every day, he sees your 
moves every day."</P>

<H3>States Take Action (sidebar)</H3>

<P>Some states require notification of local police when a released convict moves into town, 
including:</P>
<B>Alabama</B>--Those convicted of two or more felonies must register with the town sheriff 
within 24 hours of moving to a new address.</BR>
<B>Florida and Mississippi</B>--All convicted felons must register with the town sheriff within 
24 hours of moving to a new address.<BR>
<B>Minnesota</B>--Only those convicted of certain crimes must register, such as murder and 
child molestation.</BR>
<B>Missouri and Tennessee</B>--Only those on parole need register.<BR>
<B>Nevada</B>--All felons who stay for more than 48 hours must register with the police, as 
must all visiting ex-cons who come to the state five or more times within 30 days.
In a number of other states, community-notification laws apply only to sex offenders. Though 
provisions of last year's federal anti-crime legislation may ultimately require all those 
convicted of sex crimes to register with state authorities, so far only some states keep 
track of sex offenders. They include:<BR>
<B>Arkansas</B>--The staff of a facility that is releasing a habitual child molester must send 
state police the offender's new address.<BR>
<B>California</B>--Citizens will soon be able to call a state-run 900 number to receive 
information about those convicted of child molestation.<BR>
<B>Connecticut</B>--Released sex offenders must register with state law enforcement.<BR>
<B>Delaware</B>--Police may announce a sex offender's release in a newspaper advertisement.<BR>
<B>Georgia</B>--As a condition of parole, chronic sex offenders must notify the sheriff in the 
town to which they move upon release from prison.<BR>
<B>Indiana</B>--Police departments must tell any citizen who asks the names of child molesters 
who live in his or her county.<BR> 
<B>New Jersey</B>--Sex offenders must notify the police of their home addresses every three 
months, and in some cases must continue doing so for life.<BR>
<B>Oregon</B>--When a child molester goes free, the department of corrections may alert 
police, churches, convenience stores, neighbors, businesses, or other places where minors 
congregate.</BR>
<B>Washington</B>--Police may post flyers giving the names, photographs, and addresses of  
chronic sex offenders.<BR>

<title>After the Summit: Preventing the Collapse of Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations - Heritage</title>

<h3>AFTER THE SUMMIT: PREVENTING THE COLLAPSE OF ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATIONS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 463<br>
October 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last week's Arab-Israeli summit in Washington was a foreign policy fiasco. President Bill Clinton claimed that it was a success because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat began to talk to each other again after their negotiating dialogue had been broken off by civil disorders that claimed the lives of 15 Israelis and 59 Palestinians. But talking, by definition, is what happens at a summit. The real test of the Washington summit was whether Clinton could take concrete action to advance the American goal of building a secure and stable Arab-Israeli peace--and here the talks failed miserably. There was no substantive agreement, and the only outcome was procedural--a decision to undertake nonstop negotiations beginning October 6 at the Erez border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was so little agreement that the two sides were unable even to hammer out a joint statement. Instead, at the summit's conclusion, President Clinton read a maddeningly vague statement that failed to condemn the political violence that had derailed the negotiations, despite the fact that such violence--particularly armed attacks by the Palestinian police--violated the September 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord signed at the White House. Moreover, Clinton's statement included a weak and unseemly plea to the violent Palestinian mobs that endanger the fragile peace negotiations, asking them to give the summit participants "more time."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This timid entreaty ignores the fact that the Palestinian civil disorders were not a spontaneous reaction to the September 23 opening of a second exit to an archaeological tunnel in Jerusalem; they were orchestrated by Arafat, who used the official Palestinian television and radio stations to incite his followers. The Palestinian leader charged falsely that the tunnel somehow defiled Muslim holy sites located 250 yards away. Arafat undoubtedly hoped to exploit the ensuing violence to undermine Prime Minister Netanyahu's domestic political support, isolate him abroad, and drive a wedge between Israel and the United States that could help strengthen the Palestinian bargaining position in future negotiations with Israel. This strategy can work only if the outside world buys into it by blaming Israel for Arafat's brinkmanship. Clinton should have made it clear to Arafat that exploiting political violence to gain negotiating leverage is unacceptable and will doom the negotiations if tried again.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Washington summit also dealt a setback to U.S. foreign policy by squandering the prestige and credibility of an American President on a risky, unscripted diplomatic enterprise. The summit's prospects for success were marred by inadequate advance preparation and the lack of a clear negotiating agenda, and its inconclusive results will undermine American policy in the Middle East by leading U.S. allies and adversaries in the region to question the wisdom and skill of American policymakers at the highest levels. This is particularly damaging, coming on the heels of President Clinton's weak response to Saddam Hussein's violation of the Kurdish safe haven in August.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A more prudent response to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis would have been for Secretary of State Warren Christopher to take the lead as a diplomatic troubleshooter, holding presidential involvement in reserve as a last resort. The failure of the Washington summit is likely to undercut Clinton's ability to convene another emergency summit in the future, thereby limiting U.S. options in the event of another crisis in Arab-Israeli relations. In the future, the Clinton Administration should rule out such diplomatic high-wire acts and make every effort to avoid engaging the prestige of the presidency unless some diplomatic progress is assured in advance.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the aftermath of the summit, the U.S. should modify its approach to promoting peace to reflect the fact that negotiations have been severely disrupted, if not destroyed altogether, by the recent political violence. The cornerstone of the Oslo agreement, negotiated by Israel and the PLO in Norway in August 1993, was Palestinian renunciation of the "armed struggle" in return for Israeli recognition and an opportunity to gain gradually increasing authority over an incrementally growing slice of territory. The recent violence, especially the participation of some of the 30,000 Palestinian police, threatens the viability of the Oslo process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ailing peace negotiations need major surgery, not a cosmetic facelift. This urgent operation requires the agreement and close cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government. The U.S. cannot impose a solution, but it must assist the two sides to reach a durable agreement. To do so, the Clinton Administration should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Make bolstering security against terrorism the highest priority.</b> More than 230 Israelis have been killed by terrorists since the September 1993 peace accord, compared with 209 killed in the entire decade before the agreement was signed on the White House lawn. Prime Minister Netanyahu has pledged to continue along the Oslo negotiating track, but seeks to renegotiate parts of the original agreement to enhance Israeli security. The U.S. should sympathize with this approach, especially since the Palestinian police -- presumed at Oslo to be an anti-terrorist force -- have proved unreliable. Washington also should encourage the two sides to negotiate improved security arrangements for the 450 Israeli settlers in Hebron, the last Palestinian city under Israeli control, that provide for Israeli military redeployment within (but not from) that tense city.
<p>
<b><li>Insist that Yasser Arafat suppress terrorism and cease his inflammatory rhetoric. </b>  Arafat's police intermittently crack down on Hamas (the Islamic Resistance Movement) and other terrorist groups opposed to peace negotiations and then seek to co-opt them by releasing their members from prison. If he expects to be treated as a reliable negotiating partner, Arafat must comply consistently and fully with his obligation under the Oslo agreement to halt terrorism, take action to purge his police force of those that fired on Israelis, stop using political violence as a negotiating tactic, and cease his calls for a jihad (holy war).
<p>
<b><li>Stretch out the negotiating timetable.</b> Oslo process established a five-year period of Palestinian self-government that would allow the two sides to build confidence in each other before they resolved the most contentious issues, such as Palestinian statehood, the demarcation of borders, the status of Jerusalem, the future of Israeli settlements, and the question of Palestinian refugees. These thorny issues were not scheduled to be negotiated until the final status talks, slated to start at the beginning of the third year of Palestinian self-government. It was hoped that both sides by then would gain the political flexibility needed to make difficult compromises. However, the experiment in coexistence has turned into a nightmare for Israelis, who have become less willing to take risks for peace.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To salvage the chances for a stable peace, the negotiating deadline for reaching a final status agreement should be stretched out past the current 1999 target date. Final status talks should begin as soon as possible, but the two sides should be freed from deadline pressures to enable them to reach a workable agreement without being rushed. This will give the Palestinian Authority more time to prove that it is willing and able to cooperate with Israel in rooting out terrorism. Moreover, it will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a durable peace. Pressing the two sides to rush to meet the 1999 deadline when most other deadlines set by the Oslo agreement have been missed is unrealistic and could jeopardize the chances for a genuine peace.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. must focus on its long-term goal of helping to build a stable and secure Arab-Israeli peace, and not become bogged down in obsessively advancing a "peace process" that is doomed to failure unless its security flaws are rectified. While Washington should continue to serve as an honest broker in the negotiations, it must bear in mind that Israel is a close ally whose vital security requirements should not be sacrificed for Palestinian promises that too often go unfulfilled.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 118<br>
September 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<title>Give Netanyahu A Chance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>GIVE NETANYAHU A CHANCE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James A. Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 452<br>
June 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Prime Minister-elect Binyamin Netanyahu's stunning victory in Israel's May 29 elections has jolted Washington. The conventional wisdom holds that Netanyahu's election spells trouble for the Arab-Israeli peace process and inevitably will generate increased frictions in Israel's relations with the Palestinians, neighboring Arab states, and the United States. This is not necessarily so. In fact, the Clinton Administration can help make sure that this does not happen by reformulating its peace strategy to adjust to the new situation in Israel.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the prevailing opinion in the American media, which often demonized Netanyahu's Likud Party, the Israeli elections were not a referendum on Arab-Israeli peace. By electing Netanyahu, Israelis did not vote against peace, they voted for security. The Israeli public has grown increasingly embittered in recent months by the deteriorating personal security situation. Sadly, the 217 Israelis killed by terrorists since the September 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accord exceeds the 209 killed in the entire decade before the accord was signed on the White House lawn. Clearly, the peace negotiations launched by the Yitzhak Rabin-Shimon Peres government failed to safeguard Israeli security against terrorist attack. If the prevailing trends had continued, support for the peace talks inside Israel would have eroded to such an extent that they would have been doomed to failure.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Netanyahu pragmatically has pledged to continue the peace negotiations. But instead of obsessively advancing the "peace process," he has spoken of making progress on the "peace and security process."  Netanyahu declared that the Likud would not have signed the 1993 Oslo agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, but he has accepted it as a diplomatic <I>fait accompli</I> that must be respected as long as the Palestinians live up to their commitments under the agreement. He is expected to be much more forceful than his predecessors in insisting on total Palestinian compliance with the interim agreements negotiated thus far. In particular, he has expressed great dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority's failure to crack down systematically on terrorists and to extradite terrorists that have murdered Israelis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precise outlines of Netanyahu's policies will not become clear until he forms a government and drafts a coalition agreement that spells out government policy on critical issues. The Prime Minister-elect hopes to complete this process and present his cabinet to the new parliament when it convenes on June 17. The Likud's 32 parliamentary seats leave it 29 seats short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. This means Netanyahu will have to strike deals with at least four other political parties to bring them into a governing coalition, a political necessity that will substantially shape the policies of his government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the election campaign Netanyahu promised two major changes in policy toward the West Bank and Gaza: He would revive the settlement program frozen by the Rabin-Peres government and he will give the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) full freedom of action in combating terrorism inside autonomous Palestinian areas. Each of these policies could disrupt the negotiations if pursued too vigorously, but if pursued judiciously may become a useful bargaining chip in the final status talks with the Palestinians that began in May.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The first major test of Israeli-Palestinian relations under the new government is likely to come over the question of Israeli military withdrawal from Hebron, the last Palestinian city under direct Israeli control. The Labor government had agreed to withdraw Israeli forces from most of the city, except for an area inhabited by 450 Israeli settlers, by mid-June. Netanyahu had criticized this decision during the election campaign, but stated noncommittally after the election that he had requested a "study" on the issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians are likely to proceed at a more deliberate pace than in the past, Israel's relations with Jordan, another peace partner, may actually improve. Jordan's King Hussein, who defeated Yasser Arafat's PLO in a bloody civil war in 1970, was known to be nervous about the close cooperation between Israel's Labor government and his Palestinian rival, which he feared would come at his expense. King Hussein already has publicly proclaimed support for Netanyahu and expressed confidence that the new Prime Minister will continue Israel's peace efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest change in Israel's foreign policy is likely to come in its strategy toward Syria. Netanyahu has ruled out a military withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, Israeli-occupied territory that dominates the Syrian-Israeli border area. But he has pledged to make diplomatic efforts to reach incremental agreements that could greatly improve Syrian-Israeli relations. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Adjusting U.S. Policy.</b> Despite the Clinton Administration's open efforts to boost Peres's re-election campaign, Netanyahu assured President Clinton after the election that Israeli-American relations are "as stable as a rock."  The relationship between Netanyahu's government and the Clinton Administration probably will pass through an initial honeymoon period that could last through the November U.S. elections. But friction is likely to develop on a number of fronts: the Hebron withdrawal issue, Netanyahu's plans to boost settlement activities, disagreements over security issues, and clashes over peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To minimize tension in bilateral relations and improve diplomatic cooperation on peace and other issues, the Clinton Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Sound out Netanyahu.</b> The Prime Minister-elect has accepted President Clinton's telephone invitation to visit Washington shortly after he forms his governing coalition. During the visit, the Administration should explore with an open mind Netanyahu's suggestions for new approaches to the peace negotiations, strategic cooperation, and other issues. 
<P>
<li><b> Rethink the Administration's approach to Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.</b> The May 29 elections demonstrated that Israelis increasingly are reluctant to take greater security risks in exchange for Palestinian promises that often go unfulfilled. The two-year experiment in coexistence before the commencement of final status negotiations last month was supposed to allow the two sides to build confidence in each other, which would allow both to show more flexibility in the difficult final status talks. But for Israelis the experiment in coexistence has been a nightmare. To salvage the chances for a genuine long-term settlement, the negotiating timetable for the final status agreement should be stretched out past the current 1999 deadline. This would give the Palestinian Authority more time to prove it is willing and able to stamp out terrorism. Moreover, it will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a stable and lasting peace. Pressing the two sides to rush to meet the 1999 deadline, when most other deadlines set up by the September 1993 accord have been missed, is unrealistic and could undermine the chances for a genuine peace. 
<p>
<li><b> Toughen U.S. policy toward Syria.</b> Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad has used his perfunctory negotiations with Israel as a diplomatic figleaf to avoid Western pressure to halt his long-standing support of terrorism. The Administration should end its coddling of Assad and lead an international campaign to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on Damascus until it ends its support for Palestinian, Lebanese, and Turkish terrorists. As long as Syria continues to support such terrorist groups, it is unrealistic to expect it to function as an acceptable negotiating partner at the peace table.
<p>
<li><b> Pressure Yasser Arafat to suppress terrorism.</b> Terrorism is the chief threat to peace. The Clinton Administration should warn Arafat that, if the Palestinian Authority is incapable of halting terrorism, the U.S. will support Israel's right to self-defense in the event that Netanyahu orders the IDF to strike at terrorists in the autonomous areas. Moreover, Washington should warn Arafat that it will halt its $100 million per year in foreign aid if the Palestinian Authority continues to shirk its commitment to suppress terrorism.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to what passes for conventional wisdom in Washington, Prime Minister Netanyahu will be a pragmatic leader with a realistic foreign policy. Unlike the Peres and Clinton Administrations, which have made the peace process an end in itself, Netanyahu sees peace negotiations as a means to an end -- building a stable and genuine peace based on hardheaded security arrangements.

<title>To Promote Israel-PLO Peace, Press Arafat to Crack Down on Terrorism -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TO PROMOTE ISRAEL-PLO PEACE, PRESS ARAFAT TO CRACK DOWN ON TERRORISM</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 260<br>
September 26, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 963, "Beyond the Israeli-PLO Peace Agreement:  The U.S. Role in Consolidating Peace," October 31, 1993.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
	The interim Israeli-Palestinian agreement to be signed at the White House on September 28 is the product of grueling negotiations that ultimately may be doomed to fail. Israelis, who have taken the biggest risks in the negotiations and made the only concrete concessions, have become increasingly disillusioned with the deal they have struck with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. Arafat has failed to meet his commitment to halt Palestinian terrorism and instead has sought a political truce with Hamas, the radical Islamic movement violently opposed to peace with Israel. Palestinians, whose expectations have been raised by Arafat's over-selling of the negotiations, have been disappointed by Arafat's capricious leadership, his construction of a repressive regime riddled with corruption, cronyism, and inefficiency, and the continued fall in Palestinian living standards due to security-motivated closures of the border, which have deprived them of trade and jobs in Israel.
<p>
	The 460-page document to be signed at the White House extends Palestinian self-rule, already established in Gaza and Jericho, to include about 30 percent of the West Bank and most of the Palestinian population. It fleshes out the vague guidelines set forth in the September 1993 Declaration of Principles for interim Palestinian self-rule until a final settlement is negotiated and takes effect in May 1999. Although the full details of the agreement will not be made public until after the Israeli Cabinet votes on its approval, it is known to include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from six Palestinian cities and over 400 villages, along with the transfer of authority to Palestinian police forces in these areas within six months after the agreement is signed. Israeli security forces are to retain control of Israeli settlements, military bases, and the roads that connect them, as well as a zone in the city of Hebron, where 400 Israeli settlers live in close proximity to 120,000 Palestinians.
<p>
	After the Israeli troop redeployment, elections are to be held for a Palestinian Council of 82 members and a chief executive. The Council will assume many of the powers of a sovereign government, excluding the conduct of foreign affairs, external defense, and control of its borders with Egypt and Jordan, its airspace, or its use of communications wavelengths. It will have the right to establish courts, but those courts will lack jurisdiction over Israeli citizens, settlements, or military bases. Israel agreed to release a significant number of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in three stages. Arafat agreed to revoke provisions in the Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call for the destruction of Israel. He had pledged to do so two years ago but did not follow through; this time, a deadline is set:  within two months of the inauguration of the Palestinian Council.
<p>
	This week's White House signing ceremony is likely to be a sober affair, in contrast to the euphoria that enveloped the White House on September 13, 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat signed the Declaration of Principles that outlined a framework and a timetable for a negotiated peace. Two years ago, the White House festivities celebrated a political wedding of sorts. Arafat and Rabin, after a breathless courtship, for better or worse had joined their political fortunes. Now the honeymoon is over. This week's ceremony more closely resembles the early stages of divorce proceedings between the Israelis and Palestinians, with Arafat seeking Palestinian statehood while Rabin seeks "separation."  It sets the stage for protracted and bitter negotiations on the final status of long-disputed territory that Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
<p>
	The mood at the White House also is likely to be dampened by the knowledge that the thorniest issues in dispute have been postponed until negotiations on final status issues begin in May 1996. These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The question of Palestinian statehood.</b> Arafat insists that he will gain a Palestinian state, while Israel opposes such a solution due to security concerns.
<p>
<li><b>The demarcation of borders.</b> The PLO demands the return of all territory that Israel captured in the 1967 war, while Israel seeks some modifications of the 1967 border as necessary to assure Israeli security.
<p>
<li><b>Security arrangements.</b> Israel seeks early warning stations and military bases along the Jordan River and West Bank ridge lines, restrictions on the size and armament of Palestinian security forces, and undisputed control of Palestinian airspace, among other security precautions.
<p>
<li><b>The status of Jerusalem.</b> The PLO seeks to gain sovereignty over East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1967, while Israel insists that Jerusalem is its "indivisible and eternal capital."
<p>
<li><b>The future of Israeli settlements.</b> The PLO seeks to expel Israelis from the territories occupied in 1967, while Israel opposes the removal of its 120,000 settlers.
<p>
<li><b>The question of Palestinian refugees.</b> Israel seeks to minimize the number of Palestinians that will be allowed to return to the West Bank and Gaza and opposes the return of Palestinians to Israel. The PLO wants to maximize the number of returning refugees and gain compensation for those who lost property or are not permitted to return.
<p>
<li><b>The allocation of scarce water resources.</b> Israel draws approximately one-third of its water supplies from the territories.
</ul><p>
	The theory behind the two-stage negotiating process was that the two sides would conduct a two-year experiment in coexistence that would allow them to build confidence in each other and demonstrate good faith. It was hoped that this would give each side greater flexibility when it came time to address the most contentious issues. But the experiment in coexistence has been a nightmare. Continued terrorist attacks, particularly the use of car bombs against civilians inside Israel, have undermined Israeli support for peace negotiations and fanned distrust of Arafat's PLO. Even the diminishing number of Israelis who believe that Arafat is sincere in his disavowal of terrorism have come to question the value of an agreement with a weak leader who is unable to deliver on his promises. If unchecked, terrorism and the resulting erosion of Israeli support for the negotiations soon will make a final status settlement unreachable, if it is not so already.
<p>
	To help consolidate a genuine and lasting Arab-Israeli peace that will advance U.S. national interests, Washington should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Maximize pressure on Arafat to crack down on terrorism.</b> Terrorism is the chief threat to peace, yet the U.S. has not done as much as it can to press Arafat to abide by his commitment under the Declaration of Principles to halt terrorism. Part of the problem is that the U.S. has not fully used the leverage afforded by its 1993 pledge to provide the Palestinians with $500 million over five years as a reward for negotiating peace. Under the terms of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA), which set aside prohibitions against U.S. government funding for the PLO, the executive branch must certify that the PLO has lived up to its commitments, including a halt of terrorism, before the MEPFA is periodically renewed. The State Department's compliance reports have been a "whitewash," according to House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY). This has allowed the MEPFA to become little more than an entitlement program. Instead of allowing the Clinton Administration to judge PLO compliance, Congress should strengthen congressional oversight over the disbursement of scarce aid resources and judge PLO compliance with its commitments for itself. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) and Representative Michael Forbes (R-NY) have introduced legislation, the Middle East Peace Compliance Act, to do just that. This would be a step in the right direction that would give the PLO increased incentives to abide by its commitment to halt terrorism.
<p>
<li><b>Encourage the two sides to negotiate with each other, not with Washington.</b> The Clinton Administration should resist the temptation to leap into diplomatic action every time the two sides reach a negotiating impasse. This ultimately retards negotiating progress as the parties become increasingly dependent on American intervention.
<P>
<li><b>Let the two sides stretch out the negotiating timetable to allow a realistic chance of peace.</b> The target deadlines set by the Declaration of Principles have been missed repeatedly in the interim negotiations. This week's signing has come more than a year later than proposed by that overly optimistic agreement. Given the much more difficult nature of the issues remaining to be resolved, it is unrealistic to expect that the May 1999 deadline for a final settlement will be met. It will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a genuine peace. The U.S. therefore should not press the two sides to rush to meet arbitrary negotiating deadlines that could undermine the chances of a lasting peace.

<BR><FONT SIZE=7>Clinton seeks to please<BR>gays and moderates</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%>By Paul Bedard<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>


<BR><DD>President Clinton is wooing homosexual voters and AIDS activists, who were angered by his handling of their issues earlier in his term, by making new promises to consider expanded civil rights - including same-sex &quot;marriages.&quot;

<BR><DD>Capitalizing on a top issue in the community, Marsha Scott, Mr. Clinton's liaison to homosexual activists, is seeking suggestions on what position the president should take on same-sex marriages.

<BR><DD>In Boston recently, Miss Scott told a homosexual group, &quot;We [need] to find ways to ensure that those of you in these loving, long-term and committed relationships can enjoy all the same benefits that [heterosexual couples] are entitled to under the law.&quot;

<BR><DD>She added that using same-sex marriages may not be the right &quot;vehicle&quot; now but said, &quot;I'm going to argue that we broaden the context and look at the rights that gays and lesbians have ... and where those rights are denied.&quot;

<BR><DD>Asked about Miss Scott's little-noticed statements, a senior administration official said homosexual marriage is &quot;not something we intend to espouse.&quot;

<BR><DD>The official said that the White House will leave it to states to decide the issue, and that Mr. Clinton wants to do &quot;everything we can to support&quot; traditional marriages between heterosexuals.

<BR><DD>But the aide added: &quot;The president is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether certain basic benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to remain sensitive to the traditional values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination.&quot;

<BR><DD>Mr. Clinton, said the official, is &quot;personally&quot; opposed to homosexual marriages.

<BR><DD>Opponents of Mr. Clinton, however, noted that he also &quot;objected&quot; to late-term partial-birth abortions but vetoed a ban on the procedure.

<BR><DD>Conservative and liberal critics of the president complained about the aide's comments, which they said were designed merely to solicit support for the president. Miss Scott did not return a reporter's phone call.

<BR><DD>Steve Michael, a third-party presidential candidate supported by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said &quot;they're making more empty promises.&quot;

<BR><DD>Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said, &quot;The president is between a rock and a hard place, because he knows embracing same-sex marriage would alienate most voters who view him as a moderate.&quot;

<BR><DD>In an interview with Windows, New England's largest homosexual newspaper, Miss Scott said that in a Dole-Clinton race, &quot;I think you have extremely clear choices. You are either at the political table with a Clinton administration, or there is not even a door for you to get to the table.&quot;

<h3>Issues '96:  FLAT OUT SEND THEM HOME</h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p> Election season's traditional kickoffs in Iowa and New 
Hampshire are within sight, so now might be a good time to look at the definitive issues 
of the upcoming election.  1994 was the year of downsizing, and, to an extent, 1992 was 
the year of the balanced budget.  On Wednesday, Representative Bill McCollum of 
Florida said this campaign would revolve around the flat tax and term limits.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My next two columns will try to give you new insights into 
these two issues.  We know why we support term limits, but we don't always have the 
answers to our opponents' arguments.  So here are some questions to anticipate for the 
upcoming year and our answers to them.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The system already has a term limits provision -- it is called the election! 
</b> 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citizens can vote incumbents out of office, but 
challengers to incumbents face an uphill battle from the start.  Do you want to take on the 
name recognition, the franking privileges, the special interest support, and the fundraising 
capabilities of an incumbent?  	Probably not, and neither do a majority of qualified 
candidates.  Incumbents who choose to seek reelection almost always win (about 90% an 
election), so career legislators can stay in office as long as they choose.
 <p><ul>
<li><b>Term Limits is not the issue --  what we need is real campaign finance 
reform!</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Absolutely, but remember the PAC system was a 
reform measure in the first place enacted in the `70s that has led many to believe it is 
more of a problem than a solution.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	At a term limits conference on Wednesday, Senator 
Fred Thompson of Tennessee called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform 
vehicle."  Even if  lobbyists and congressmen are unwilling to restructure the financial 
side of campaigns, term limits offer a viable alternative.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After winning reelection Senators would not have to 
worry, as Thompson said, about "raising another dime."  The result would be more 
challenger vs. challenger races which would decrease the cost to run for elected office as 
well as the influence of PACs.
<p><ul>
<li><b>If we enact term limits, all we do is give more power to Congressional 
staff.</b>
 </ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	An average staff member on the Hill lasts only 
about 5 to 6 years according to a Heritage study, the Hill staff takes direction from 
Congressman, not the other way around. 
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to a majority of the Republican freshman 
that I have spoken to, they hired staff that was untrained in the ways of DC in an effort to 
limit the old-style perk system.  Most congressmen prefer to have staff members that 
think and support the views of the congressman and the district.  
<p><ul>
<li><b>In the past, term limits has been a minor issue - Why is this the year of term 
limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The public opinion polls show up to 80% of citizens 
supporting some sort of term limits legislation.  That overwhelming support is bolstered 
by a growing group of organizations, like US Term Limits and Americans Back in 
Change, that on a grass-roots level are pushing for national and local reform.  
<p>
	&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This year was the first year in which the 
Congressman actually voted on term limits.  Although talked about for years, this is the 
first election year that Congressman can be held accountable on the issue of term limits 
based on actual floor votes. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Why term limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Term limits are an effort to make Congressman 
realize that they are going to Washington temporarily, not making a career move.  We 
need Congressman who come to Washington with the citizen-legislator mentality  -  
"Let's get some things done and then get back home to our families."

<P>
AMERICA IS VULNERABLE TO MISSILE ATTACK
<P>
By Edwin Feulner
<P>
 President Clinton may be willing to close the street in front
of the White House to guard against fence climbers and potential
truck bombers. But he resolutely sticks his head in the sand when
it comes to the need to defend America against possible missile
attack.
<P>
 Recently, one of the president's top national security advisors
told Congress, in effect, &quot;don't worry, be happy,&quot; because
there isn't any nuclear threat now and probably won't be one for
many years to come. Thanks, I feel so much safer.
<P>
 Apparently, if Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Jan Lodal is
to be believed, the administration's policy is to build a missile-defense
system only after some rogue regime like North Korea or Iraq has
in its possession ballistic missiles capable of striking Portland,
Maine, Ogden, Utah, or some other U.S. town or city. 
<P>
 And even then, Lodal told lawmakers, according to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty -- a pact signed with the now defunct Soviet
Union -- America could only erect &quot;a limited defense.&quot;
And by the way, he added, the ABM pact also means we would have
to get Russia's permission before we start building!
<P>
 The fact is that the threat of a ballistic missile attack against
America's cities could become all too terrifyingly real very soon.
And, presently, America is undefended. 
<P>
 Just last year the Pentagon's top intelligence experts told Congress
for the first time that North Korea is developing a missile called
the &quot;Taepo Dong 2,&quot; with a range of  up to 6,000 miles,
which means it could strike New York or Boston.
<P>
 Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria -- not exactly known for their love
of America -- also are working on nuclear weapons and the rockets
to &quot;deliver&quot; them.
<P>
 The potential threat is real -- and complicated further by the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union. Nobody knows for certain
that disaffected members of the former Soviet Red Army won't sell
some rogue nation or terrorist group some of the 1,300-plus ballistic
missiles now &quot;controlled&quot; by Russia. All it takes is
one.
<P>
 The People's Republic of China has an estimated 100 ballistic
missiles. Its CSS-2, with a range of 1,860 miles, was recently
sold to Saudi Arabia. Fortunately, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally
-- but can President Clinton guarantee that the next CSS-2 buyer
will not be a Saddam Hussein? In a few years, the list of nations
capable of threatening the United States and its allies with ballistic
missiles is likely to expand to 20 or more. How long before somebody
pushes the button?
<P>
 Most Americans have no idea that if America's leaders decided
to do so, we could erect an effective missile-defense system within
five years, capable of protecting the entire United States at
a cost of only $4 billion to $5 billion.
<P>
 The United States should erect defenses against ballistic missiles
regardless of whether it &quot;violates&quot; the ABM Treaty,
or what the Russians think about it. America has a sovereign right
to defend herself. She should do so, and quit pretending the threats
aren't really out there. 
<P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/15/96</P><H1>Fostering a new west that respects old values</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.  Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives. They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and bring with them an utterly different value system for the land.  A value system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities. </P>

<P>To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation.  They demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values.  Many locals are resentful.   </P>

<P>     Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation and cooperation.  Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard labor that traditional Western jobs require.  And long-time residents need to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers.  Both must recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.   </P>

<P>     Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and values that have long defined the West.  Here's a story from a recent trip to <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State University</A>, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames the debate for me.  I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.</P>

<P>         I used to work in the woods.  Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and Idaho.  I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific Northwest, and  in 1977, I finally got the chance.  On sabbatical leave from my regular university post,  I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State University.  This left plenty of time to work in the woods.   </P>

<P>    Nearly 20 years later  I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a few days of meetings.  Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks and other signs of fundamental change.  While Ramona worked with her fellow academics, I rode my bike.  One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber.  I wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and maintained.  In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner.   Also, I needed a new saw.</P>

<P>     The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.  I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop.  It spent its declining years on our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood.  That's an easy life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.  </P>

<P>Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy.  It's hard-core, a good place to find recipes for spotted owl.  My Lycra was on trespass in corked-boot territory.  Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust was the same.  The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter.  He looked up from his work as I entered.  </P>

<P>     &quot;Hi, Ken,&quot; I said.  &quot;Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around 1977?  Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days a week?  You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd known he was professor.&quot;  I took off my Bolles.</P>

<P>     &quot;Damn! Hi, John.&quot; He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand.  We exchanged news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong reasons.  &quot;With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees,&quot; he said. &quot;Less wood more saws.  Not many pros in the woods anymore.&quot;  He is looking towards  the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years.  The changing values of the new West aren't for Ken.</P>

<P>     &quot;Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out.  Will you send me a new one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me,&quot; I said, &quot;but I have a Visa card.&quot;</P>

<P>     &quot;Hell, don't bother.  Just send me a check when you get home.&quot;</P>

<P>     The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:</P>

<P><CENTER>
LEBANON<BR>
Saw Shop Lebanon,<BR>
Oregon</CENTER></P>

<P>I put it on to finish writing this essay.  And I thought about trust-about how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust.  Twenty years and a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work honorably done. </P>

<P>     I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old.  Trust that comes from working together is high on my list.  Its presence in my own life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.  </P>

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>
RUSTY


<p>Sorry -- this is going to have to be a short one. I've been in the Oval Office with Bill, Mrs. William J. Clinton, Bob Rubin, and Dick Morris. We were talking strategy for the coming budget battle, and I'm waiting for the meeting to resume. For the first time in months, we're feeling confident and ready to go to war!

<p> Mrs. WJC and Dick Morris have put Bill on a pretty stringent diet -- high fiber, low fat. As you must know, Rusty, ever since my New York Times bestseller Earth in the Balance (for which, by the way, I was paid a moderate advance and had my contract vetted by the Senate Ethics Committee -- just so you know), they've been clamoring for another Al Gore manuscript. Just last week I finalized it. It's a compilation of all of the changes and streamlining that we've done since my revolutionary ``Re-Inventing Government'' proposals. Let me tell you, I sweated over those 43 pages. But in the end it was worth it -- I smell another hit! 
<p>
And Tipper had a cute idea: put a picture of Bill five months ago on the front cover -- you know, puffy-faced, red-nosed, cottony-eyed, kind of a ``government before the Gore plan'' photo; and on the back cover, put a photo of the leaner, trimmer Bill as a ``government after the Gore plan'' photo. So now we're in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for the leaner and trimmer Bill to emerge. 
<p>
In this meeting, anyway, he's certainly holding his own. I recommended that we make no concessions, no compromises. He nodded in agreement.
<p>
``Absolutely,'' he said. ``I think there comes a time when we just say, 'Hey, there are some things that we believe in, some things we will absolutely not compromise on.'''
<p>
``Great!'' I said.Bill looked plaintively at Mrs. WJC. She nodded to Dick Morris. Dick reached into a pocket and removed a jumbo Snickers bar. Bill tore into it.
<p>
``Gosh,'' I said, ``that's a peculiar diet regimen.''
<p>
``Yeah, well . . .'' mumbled Bill, mouth full. He turned to Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. ``I raised taxes too much, didn't I?'' he asked.
<p>
Bob was about to reply, when Dick Morris snatched away what remained of the Snickers bar. Mrs. WJC took out a short ruler, and with amazing speed snapped it down hard on Bill's hand.
<p>
``Ow!'' he cried.
<p>
``There's more where that came from,'' she said.
<p>
I just looked out the window, embarrassed. You know me, Rusty: I say, ``Let Clinton be Clinton.''
<p>
Bob Rubin leaned forward and spoke, almost in a whisper. ``Mr. President, do you really think you raised my taxes too much?''
<p>
Bill was silent for a moment. Bob opened up his case and took out a large McDonald's bag. ``Look, Mr. President. Look what I've got! A Big Mac -- '' Bob removed the plastic box -- I made a mental note to tell him that it will take our precious environment 15,000,000,000 years to digest the box that contains a hamburger that will take him only 15 minutes to digest -- and Bob began to eat the Big Mac. He reached into the bag and pulled out another one.
<p>
``Well, lookee here! Another Big Mac, all warm and gooey. Who will help me eat this, I wonder?''
<p>Bill answered in a tiny voice, ``I will.''
<p>
Mrs. WJC got into the act. ``But why should he give it to you? You raised his taxes too much.''
<p>
``No I didn't.''
<p>
``I CAN'T HEAR YOU!''
<p>
``No I didn't!''
<p>
Bob tossed Bill the second Big Mac. Paper rustled, lettuce flew, special sauce splattered -- the whole thing was gone in an eyeblink.
<p>
The intercom buzzed. ``Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich on conference call, Mr. President.''
<p>
Bill reached for the phone. Mrs. WJC waved her ruler. Dick Morris produced a large pepperoni pizza.
<p>
``Hello, Senator, Mr. Speaker,'' Bill said. ``I must tell you that I'm very disappointed in your budget bill. I think it declares war on the poor and underprivileged, it maintains a generous welfare for businesses and lobbyists, and I plan to veto it.''
<p>He paused for a moment, while Dole and Gingrich spoke. After a moment or two, Mrs. WJC put away her ruler, and Dick Morris put the pizza down on the credenza.
<p>
Bill cleared his throat. ``Actually, Newt,'' he said, ``I see your point. And Senator, in a way I agree with you, too. Maybe if we all sit down -- ''
<p>
Mrs. WJC yanked the phone from the wall. Dick Morris tossed the pizza aside and asked if Bob and I would excuse them. As we crept out, a few aides wheeled in a large caterer's steam table, laden with pies, ribs, butte red corn, and a suckling pig.
<p>
I never realized that letting Clinton be Clinton would be so fattening.

<TITLE>Fishing Community Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/14/96</P><H1>Economic health of fisher key to health of the fishery</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> 	Public policy failures can take their toll on economic efficiency, ecological integrity, and even human lives.  These failures are endemic to fisheries commons the world over.  Recent issues of Field and Stream, Scientific American, and National Geographic all featured stories about the dire straits of our fisheries.</P>

<P>	Now the Bering Sea brings tragic news of a third outcome of poor policy: dead fishermen. The seven crewmembers of the Seattle-based Pacesetter were safety conscious.  They fell victim to callous policies which unnecessarily endanger lives of fishermen.  The Alaskan crab fishery's open-access nature encourages a mad scramble for catches in excess of sustainable yield.  The scramble is &quot;mad&quot; not only because it's exceedingly dangerous but because society is left worse off whether the risky fishermen succeed or fail.  The system rewards overfishing, and it biases how and when to fish - even if fishermen die in the attempt. </P>

<P>	Peaceful government policies kill people all the time (e.g. CAFE standards which trade blood for oil).  Seldom are they so obvious and direct as in the fishery.  When lost lives are compounded with squandered resources and fears of a global fishery crash, even politicians might place public interest above parochial advantage.</P>

<P>	The tragedy of the fisheries commons became apparent after the 1960s, when world fish stocks collapsed under increasing fishing pressure.  Reform proposals include banishing foreign fishing fleets, quotas, requiring primitive fishing techniques, and satellite surveillance.  By examining the successes and failures of various efforts, we see what makes institutions succeed or fail.</P>

<P>	They usually fail for one reason:  appropriate responsibility for conservation lies not with beneficiaries -- fishery communities.</P>

<P>	There are many examples of bureaucrats regulating from afar, legislators ruling from on high, and monitors watching from a distance.  Remote institutions neglect local conditions.  When central planners set rules, quotas, and limits, alien practices trump local traditions and customs.  </P>

<P>	Distant legislators, central planners, and bureaucrats rarely manage effectively.  Regulations have adverse consequences, quotas lead to waste, and limits are broken.  Policing and sanctioning of fishermen by outsiders is often misguided or absent.  Low-cost means of monitoring and resolving conflicts can't be provided by underfunded state policemen and international courts.  Local fishermen too easily subvert regulations, and foreigners make off with whatever fish they can while filling the coffers afar.  Alien systems generally fail.</P>

<P>	But some got it right.  In Alanya, Turkey, a fishing village evolved an ingenious solution to their fishery in jeopardy of overfishing.  By drawing lots for fishing locations at the beginning of each season, and then rotating to a new position each day, the number of fishermen in each spot is controlled.  If anyone crosses into another's site, the fisherman there will certainly notice and has incentive to report it.  No outside enforcer is required.  Every fisherman's vested interest in their 'spot of the day' provides incentives to monitor.  Limited entry and effective enforcement are low cost, stable, and local.</P>

<P>	In the Philippines, reef fishermen using explosives and cyanide to capture exotic fish have sewn the seeds of the ecosystem's destruction by both overfishing and killing the coral reef.  Establishing offshore marine sanctuaries, where explosives and cyanide are prohibited, has reversed the tide.  Fishermen are behaving responsibly, and empty nets are starting to fill.  Illegal night fishing by foreign fleets jeopardizes the rebounding fish sanctuaries.  Local communities' authority to protect their resources must carry force and respect. </P>

<P>	Managers of the South Pacific fisheries are widely credited with success.  Vast ocean stretches are dotted with tiny island nations whose national incomes are dwarfed by the foreign companies fishing their waters.  But those nations, against the odds, have formed an institution from the ground up.  They implemented an integrated and coordinated management approach and avoided overcapitalization, wasteful regulation, and international conflict.</P>

<P>	These cases provide valuable lessons.  The stories of communities in Turkey, the Philippines, and the South Pacific, teach us that those with long-term vested interests in fishery viability usually act responsibly.  People with a stake in the future, won't act like there's no tomorrow.  In contrast, open-access fisheries invite disruptive outsiders with little incentive for sustainable behavior.  That is why enduring institutions tend to flow from the community level.  Fishing villages recognize the importance of preserving this resource.  Their very livelihoods depend on it.</P>

<P>	Successful reform links the economic health of the fishermen and managers with the biological health of the fishery.  The fishermen and the fish both lose out if decisions about when, where, and how to fish are made by those not held accountable.  Fishermen know more about local conditions and have stronger incentives to improve them.  Bureaucrats and politicians don't benefit from a healthy fishery the way a fishing community does.  </P>

<P>	We can apply the important lessons of successful institutions to prevent future tragedies.  Reforms can't bring back the Pacesetter.  But their sacrifice might motivate responsible reform.  This would be a great tribute to good men lost.</P>

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

<h2><i>Convention Policy Watch<br>
Day 1</I></h2><br>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
Monday,  August 12, 1996
</center>
<P>
     Day 1 at the Republican National Convention, and I can assure you that there is a flurry of activity in and around the floor, around San Diego, and at just about every event hosting Members of Congress, state delegations, a variety of Governors, and every other VIP. What's interesting is seeing events unfold, and
then watching the convention coverage to see what the "spin" happens to be... Yesterday when I visited
with Vice President Quayle and other former colleagues, I learned that the "spin" in which the media had
the most interest was what happens now to VP Quayle now that Jack Kemp is the Republican VP
candidate. The question was: Does Quayle have a future as President? Has he been supplanted as the
future contender of the Republican Party? 
<p>
Perhaps the media should stop trying to find examples of future friction among the Republicans and focus on the issues the Republicans are trying to discuss -- hope, opportunity and economic prosperity for all Americans Any thoughts? I'll be back tomorrow to follow up.

<TITLE>Hooters Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>1/17/96</P><H1>Perverse Consequences (P.C.) of the Nanny State</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>



<P>	The feuding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hooters chain of restaurants results from government overstepping its bounds.  Government has made &quot;Hooters&quot; a household name by stimulating confrontations between market forces and those who abhor sexism and their allies in the Nanny State.</P>

<P>	People become hot and bothered over Hooters simply because &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; leave so little to the imagination.  Thus, the EEOC has targeted them.  The very thought that a business could provide an opportunity for waitresses to serve Buffalo wings with a side order of sex appeal infuriates the P.C. crowd at the EEOC.  How can the politically incorrect restaurant that provides &quot;Bunnies for Bubbas&quot; be allowed to operate?  The EEOC's calling is to bring enlightened social engineering to the masses.  Hooters' success demands their special attention.</P>

<P>	And that's precisely what happened.  No disgruntled male job applicant filed a grievance prior to the controversy.  But Hooters' very existence irritates 'Nanny State' regulators at the EEOC.  So the EEOC initiated its own three-year investigation.</P>

<P>	At an Indianapolis Hooters, for example, waitresses routinely earn from $425 to $600 for their 20-hour work week.  And in the last three years, this Hooters has tossed out a total of five people for offensive language.  And once, only once, a man inappropriately touched a Hooters Girl and spent two weeks in jail for assault.  Look, enjoy, but behave yourself.  The system seems to work.</P>

<P>	The Reno Hooters provides another excellent example.  This restaurant is a bastion of conservatism in a city ruled by casinos, showgirls, and genuinely scantily-clad cocktail waitresses.  But the EEOC is scrutinizing Hooters, not Caesar's Palace.  This is because the law recognizes that some positions are intrinsically gender-biased.  Cowgirls and showgirls are girls, Lady Macbeth is a lady, and women's restroom attendants are women.</P>

<P>	But Hooters Girls can be boys, according to EEOC investigators.  They concluded that Hooters is just a restaurant.  In their estimation, men can fill a Hooters' tank top and serve appetizers just as well as women.  Hence, the EEOC fines Hooters $22 million, mandates that 40% of Hooters Girls be men, and demands that Hooters provide scholarships and sensitivity training to benefit men.  What country are we living in? </P>

<P>	Some people support the EEOC's ruling, some would leaveHooters alone, and others would simply wipe Hooters and its 13,000 employees off the map for its insult to politically correct sensitivities.  Ironically, regardless of one's feelings about Hooters, the EEOC is doing a great disservice to everyone.  Here's how.</P>

<P>	EEOC rulings penalize Hooters.  Hooters responds by rejecting the EEOC determination that they are merely a restaurant.  Hooters asserts, and is prepared to vigorously defend, that their primary mission is &quot;providing vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;  The EEOC transforms the food and drink into side dishes.  The Hooters Girls must be the main attraction.  Only then can Hooters justify its hiring practice.</P>

<P>	That's Hooters' escape route.  When the EEOC forbids Hooters Girls from using sex appeal to sell food, then Hooters must prove that they are using sex appeal to sell sex.  The EEOC transforms Hooters from a gimmicky restaurant into a flesh-peddling bar.  The law protects the hiring practice of strip clubs, and Hooters can find sanctuary in that status.</P>

<P>	Thus, as usual, the Nanny State's efforts backfire.  Shielding the prudes and politically correct who cannot tolerate establishments like Hooters pushes Hooters even farther down a scurrilous path that further debases America. </P>

<P>	It is a familiar and predictable result.  Prohibiting some behavior causes perverse and unintended outcomes.  Coercing Hooters to fall into line with the Nanny State's singular vision of how to serve beer will do two things: (1) rob a great many people of benefits as employees, managers, and customers of Hooters; and (2) force Hooters to make selling sex its first priority.  </P>

<P>	The EEOC and the Nanny State would do well to learn an important lesson from the queen of all nannies, Mary Poppins, who sang, &quot;Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot;  Incentives make the unpalatable palatable.  This is how Hooters uses Hooter Girls to make their burgers and wings appetizing.  In the restaurant business, as in the environmental business, market forces encourage entrepreneurs to innovate enterprises that meet the market test.  Whereas coercion is counterproductive, we should recognize that market incentives often provide the best means to coordinate social actions.  Even when we find the result distasteful, the result is usually preferable to coercion.</P>

<P>	The fundamental problem with prohibiting Hooters Girls is that people want them and other people want to become them.  The managers support them.  The clientele rewards them with their hard-earned money.  And the Girls clearly prefer this work to other work.  With such powerful advantages, Hooters won't swallow the EEOC's 'medicine' without a fight.  By defying these incentives, the EEOC's command-and-control approach yields harmful and perverse results.  This is evidenced by Hooters' newfound emphasis on &quot;vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;</P>

<P>	Hooters maintains 175 restaurants in 38 states and is growing.  It is no wonder that the EEOC, an artifact of the Nanny State, cannot stand to see success based on individual liberty and sexist behavior.</P>

<title>"Liberals" fund Institute programs</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<H2>Probe shows alumni of leftist academic bastions 
donate in droves to the Leadership Institute
</H2></center>
<P>
<BR>
<B>	BY BRETT BUICK</B>
<P>
	Believe it or not.
<BR>
<DD>	A Building Leadership special investigation reveals that elements of the liberal establishment are secretly financing the Leadership Institute.<BR>
<DD>	A mystified Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute, initially expressed shock at the disclosure. "I don't understand it," he said.  "I've been fighting liberals for years.  It's hard to believe they've been supporting the Institute."
<DD>	Kevin Gentry, executive vice president of the Leadership Institute, was characteristically more terse: "Impossible."
<DD>	But an analysis of responses to a recent survey of Leadership Institute supporters reveals that many of them attended infamous bastions of trendy academic leftism like Harvard, Yale, the University of Michigan and Dartmouth.
<DD>	The establishment influence is so strong that the <a href= "alum.html"> Leadership Institute ranking </a> parallels the well-known U.S. News and World Report ranking of America's top 25 universities.
<DD>	One of the biggest surprises of the survey is that Harvard and Yale  topped the charts as alma maters of respondents, with twenty-five each.  The University of Michigan (21) was next.  Purdue (16), MIT (15), Stanford (15)  and Cornell (14) rounded out the top seven.  
<DD>	Such results prompt the question of how so many Institute donorsactually conservative, not liberalmanaged to survive the pervasive liberal atmosphere of their campuses.   
<DD>	Columnist William F. Buckley, who attended Yale University, once said he would rather be governed by the first one thousand names of the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard.  If Buckley knew Harvard and Yale topped the charts in producing Leadership Institute supporters, he'd probably be as stunned as Morton.
<DD>	William Page, an Institute supporter and Harvard alumnus, sees academics' lack of hands on, real-world experience as a reason for their liberalism.  "Much time is wasted by people talking who haven't been in the trenches," he said.
<DD>	Other Institute supporters suggest pervasive liberalism at well-known campuses is a relatively recent phenomenon, and that eastern establishment schools weren't as liberal in the past.
<DD>	One long-time Institute supporter, Edward L. Adams, sees the sixties as the cause of the schools' liberal lurch.  He observed, "My alma mater, the University of Michigan, gave away all kinds of things to radicals."  However, Adams does see hope: "Through the work of the Leadership Institute, liberal schools may be coming back [toward conservative philosophy]."
<DD>	Another possible explanation for the conservative remnant is that many Leadership Institute supporters attended college during and after the World War II period, in a more serious academic environment.  Purdue graduate and Institute supporter Daniel Worth said, "Being at college during the war left us with no time to worry about political correctness."
<DD>	One reassuring result of the surveys is that liberal strongholds weren't the only institutions to educate Leadership Institute supporters.  The U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis (11) and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (10) both made the top 20.  
<DD>	The Midwest heartland made a very strong showing, with the universities of Illinois (13), Minnesota (12) and Northwestern (12) joining Purdue and Michigan.
<DD>	While the East Coast and Midwest dominated the list, the West Coast was also represented, by Stanford, the University of Southern California (13) and UCLA (10).
<DD>	The South was underrepresented, with only the University of Texas (9) making the cut, but the region still demonstrated its strength, with several schools falling just short of the list.
<DD>	As the South rises again in the next century, however, the top rankings may change.In all, there were 317 alma maters listed.  Supporters returned  839 surveys.
Institute supporters were divided on whether today's youth should attend traditional leading institutions or turn to rising conservative schools like Hillsdale College.
<DD>	However, the supporters would probably all agree with Mr. Page: "Wherever you go, watch out for people with short left legs."

<h3>WASHINGTON'S SPENDING ON SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
 For all of Washington's new-found &quot;cost consciousness,&quot;
you'd be amazed how easy it is for special-interest groups to
find some taxpayer-funded &quot;money faucet&quot; -- turned on
by the last Congress -- that hasn't been turned off yet. You just
have to know where to look for them.
<P>
 And the threat of having your funding cut off or reduced can
really motivate you to look. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, when House Speaker Newt Gingrich eliminated
Congress' 28 special-interest caucuses -- the Congressional Black
Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, Textile Caucus, Steel Caucus, Arts Caucus,
etc. -- many of the groups began poking around for other ways
to get at your money. And many struck paydirt.
<P>
 Take, for example, the Black Caucus, which has its own foundation,
the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF). How does it
plan to continue its activities now that it can no longer do so
with your money?
<P>
 With your money. The Black Caucus Foundation currently is seeking
 $900,000 in private donations to match a $900,000 grant it's
expecting from the U.S. Commerce Department. The money allegedly
will be used to link members of the Black Caucus to &quot;the
5000+ African-American city, state and county legislators and
officials, and African-American public policy organizations, to
provide information produced by the CBCF, other policy organizations,
and pertinent information produced on Capitol Hill that impacts
the delivery of service at the local government level.&quot; 
<P>
 That's Washingtonese for saying  that &quot;government money
will be channeled through the CBCF in order to link members of
the Black Caucus with their political constituency,&quot; to quote
my friend John P. Walters in a report by his New Citizenship Project.
How does CBCF plan to establish this link? Why, through the Internet.
That's where Commerce comes in.
<P>
 The Commerce Department runs a program called the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP), as
part of Vice President Al Gore's attempt to have government micro-manage
the &quot;information superhighway.&quot; One of the Clinton administration's
main goals in establishing TIIAP was to develop a telecommunications
component for the Clinton health-care plan. That plan didn't pan
out, but this didn't stop the government from giving out $24.4
million in TIIAP grants in 1994. Nor did it stop the 103rd Congress
from appropriating $64 million for TIIAP for 1995, or the administration
from requesting $99.9 million for 1996. 
<P>
 Somebody left the money faucet running. This &quot;cyberpork&quot;
program has yet to be targeted for extinction by the GOP Congress.
And the special interests are rushing in to lap up the runoff.
This is just one example, there are many others.
<P>
 Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not against there being a Congressional
Black Caucus, or any other kind of special-interest caucus. I
just question whether taxpayers should have to pay for them. 
<P>
 And just so you know I'm willing to put my money where my mouth
is, bear in mind that early in my Washington career I served as
staff director for the House Republican Study Committee. We did
a lot of good work, and the committee's efforts over the years
were instrumental in providing intellectual fodder for the conservative
takeover of Congress last November. 
<P>
 With my blessing, and in all fairness, Speaker Gingrich and the
new Congress cut off funding for the Study Committee -- along
with the 27 other special-interest caucuses -- and it was disbanded.
<P>
 Do you think that one went looking for government handouts?
<P>
