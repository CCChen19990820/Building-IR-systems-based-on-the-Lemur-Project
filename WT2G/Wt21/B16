<h2>Orphanages</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Orphanages filled a vital need in America for more than a   
hundred years -- until meddling do-gooders decided that   
these benevolent institutions were somehow inhumane! 
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In the colonial era small children without parents were taken   
in by relatives or cared for informally by neighbors; older   
children were indentured to a master who would teach them a   
trade," observes Marvin Olasky in the May issue of   
Philanthropy, Culture & Society, published by the Capital   
Research Center. "Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was   
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's   
home for training or education; all who had hands capable of   
work were expected to use them at an early age." As of 1800,   
there were no more than seven institutions in America for   
parentless children.  
  <p>
"The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of   
the nineteenth century largely in connection with an   
outpouring of evangelical benevolence," says Olasky. "Every   
epidemic . . . created orphans and new orphanage efforts; by   
1850 there were between 71 and 77. Individual and church   
contributions paid most of the cost, but it was not-unusual to   
have -municipalities pay up to a third, and for expenses to be   
held down through some work by the orphans themselves.   
The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and   
the supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880. Character as   
well as quantity changed, however," says Olasky, noting that   
"in the late 1800s children of destitute single parents   
increasingly found their way to orphanages."  
  <p>
What was life like in these institutions? "Orphanage directors   
during the second half of the nineteenth century saw their   
mission as not merely furnishing basic material needs but   
creating model American citizens," says Olasky. "They tried   
to instill virtues such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and   
to create a capacity for hard work; they believed in busy daily   
routines and strict discipline."  
  <p>
By 1910, there were more than 100,000 children in American   
orphanages. "The word 'orphanage' itself became a   
misnomer," says Olasky, "as children of parents who were   
still living but had problems with finances or alcohol found   
the institutions safer and better than life at home. Yet, even   
though the quality of care was evident to observers, reporting   
of orphanages started to turn negative in tone. Much of the   
criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying [these   
benevolent institutions] as materially satisfactory but   
psychologically inhumane."  
 <p> 
As often happens, yellow journalism set the stage for   
government intervention. "Two White House Conferences on   
the Care of Dependent Children, in 1909 and 1919, bent in an   
anti-orphanage direction," observes Olasky; they concluded   
that "single mothers were to receive financial aid so children   
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely   
abandoned should be placed in foster care." It was not long   
before states took over the task that orphanages had   
performed. Marvin Olasky argues that children were better   
off before the government started running their lives.

<h2>Charity</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Man does not live by bread alone. Why, then, does our   
welfare system offer nothing more? 
</I></Blockquote><P>

In the March issue of Philanthropy, Culture & Society,   
Marvin Olasky argues that "we must go beyond   
sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right way,   
the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until   
recent decades." Olasky says "the reason why government   
welfare programs must be transformed is not that they are too   
expensive. The real problem is that they are too stingy about   
doing what is truly important: treating people as human   
beings made in God's image, not as animals to be fed, caged,   
and occasionally petted." He asserts that "private programs   
can do a better job if they are challenging, personal, and   
spiritual."  
  <p>
So, what did our forebears do differently? "During the l9th   
century, before the federal government ever got involved, a   
war on poverty much more successful than our own was   
waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable   
agencies and religious groups around the country," observes   
Olasky. He concedes that "poverty fighters a century ago did   
not abolish poverty," but insists that "they witnessed a   
movement out of poverty by millions of people." Attitudes   
were different in those days, among beneficiaries as well as   
benefactors. "The optimism prevalent then contrasts sharply   
with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism   
among the better-off that is so common now," says Olasky.   
Our forebears "knew that the literal meaning of compassion   
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement   
with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving money to   
them."  
  <p>
Olasky contends that 19th-century Americans "knew that   
people should be challenged. When an able-bodied man came   
to a homeless shelter, he often was asked to chop wood for   
two hours or to whitewash a building. In that way he could   
provide part of his own support and also help those unable to   
chop. They knew . . . that even the most rundown person is   
not just a taker; he can also be a giver. They knew that   
everyone is made in God's image and is capable of helping."  
  <p>
America has paid a terrible toll for its forgetfulness. "We've   
forgotten America's past successes in poverty-fighting," says   
Olasky. "The result has been not just the waste of billions of   
dollars each year, but the death of part of the American   
dream." Welfare, says Olasky, "kills dreams." Not only "the   
dreams of poor individuals who gradually become used to   
dependency," but also "the dreams of children who grow up   
without fathers," and countless other dreams that coercive   
measures cannot fulfill.  
  <p>
Olasky reports that "across America people of many faiths,   
income levels, and races are refusing to give up on the dream   
of effective compassion. More people are capturing the   
understanding that the major flaw of the modern welfare state   
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives   
the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone."

<h2>Welfare Reform/CA & IL</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
With Congress talking about bloc-granting welfare money    
back to the states, some good ideas are starting to circulate.
</I></Blockquote><P>

There are nearly three million Californians receiving Aid to    
Families with Dependent Children (known as AFDC),    
roughly two million of whom have been on the dole for more    
than two years. "To a large extent, California's history of high    
AFDC benefits is responsible for the entrenched cycle of    
poverty that many now decry," say Sally Pipes and Katherine    
Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. A    
new proposal by the California Department of Social    
Services is designed to break that "cycle of poverty" by    
substantially reducing benefits.   
   <p>
"Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment    
set," say Pipes and Post in the May issue of Alternatives in    
Philanthropy, published by the Capital Research Center.    
"Welfare would not pay more than work." This "flat grant"    
would not be affected by "any increase in the number of    
adults or children in the household." Benefits would be    
available for a limited time only. "The grant would eliminate    
eligibility requirements that make aid available only when    
one parent is deceased, disabled, missing, or unemployed,"    
say Pipes and Post. "Eligibility would instead be based on a    
simple income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a    
child under 18 years of age."   
   <p>
In spite of these promising proposals, California has been    
"fundamentally unable to respond to the particularities of    
individual cases. Herein lies an opportunity for philanthropic    
alternatives," say Pipes and Post, who like to stress "the    
importance of private efforts that are successfully addressing    
the critical and massive problem of repairing the damage    
done by the welfare state. Private programs offer powerful,    
individual-oriented approaches that no government initiative    
can match."   
   <p>
Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute in Palatine, Illinois    
argues that welfare reforms in his state don't go far enough,    
and consist mainly of "throwing good money after bad and    
reshuffling bureaucracies." .In 1994, the state's Governor    
proposed "a $5 billion-a-year state-run health maintenance    
organization." In 1996, the Governor proposed "creating a    
welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level    
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and    
programs."   
   <p>
Bast argues that different reforms "could generate much    
greater benefits more quickly." He calls for "health-care    
vouchers that would give the needy a wider choice of medical    
providers and insurers." He proposes that the care of abused    
and neglected children be turned over "to private agencies    
that have a better track record of placing children into safe    
and stable homes." And he suggests that AFDC payments be    
limited to two years and that the state "remove from the rolls    
all those who fail to report to state offices when told to do so"    
for job training and referrals.   
   <p>
The great thing about America is that our 50 states give us    
the chance to address problems in different ways. Welfare is    
a big problem, and we need all the good ideas we can get.

<h2>Welfare Reform/IA &SC</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Iowa and South Carolina offer two examples of innovative   
welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform   
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-  
sufficient,'' reports Amy Frantz of the Public Interest Institute   
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Writing in the May issue of   
Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the Capital   
Research Center, Frantz relates that Aid to Families with   
Dependent Children (known as AFDC) "was replaced with   
the Family Investment Program [which] provides cash   
benefits to participants based on their assets, income, and   
family size." Participants in the program "must sign a   
contract, called the Family Investment Agreement, in which   
they promise to participate in Iowa's employment program,   
Promise Jobs." The program provides such services as   
"education and job training, resume writing, and [instruction   
in] interviewing techniques."  
  <p>
Participants in the Family Investment Program "must agree to   
meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency,'' says Frantz.   
"Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement   
must enter a Limited Benefit Plan. This pays reduced benefits   
for three months, then terminates all benefits." Under-aged   
parents who have not yet finished high school "must pursue   
their diplomas to receive benefits."  
  <p>
Frantz reports that "Iowa has also created programs that   
allow private organizations to help those in the Family   
Investment Program." Individual Development Accounts, for   
example, "are held by low-income individuals and can be   
used for post-secondary education, the purchase of a home, or   
starting a small business," says Frantz. "In addition to funds   
that individuals contribute to [these accounts], community-  
based organizations can provide matching funds."  
  <p>
Also in the May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Mike   
Hubbard of the South Carolina Policy Council Education   
Foundation in Columbia reports that South Carolina "has   
joined a growing number of states that have enacted major   
welfare reform. Last year, the General Assembly passed the   
Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina   
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from   
distributing welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find   
jobs." The state must obtain "waivers from certain federal   
laws and regulations," however, before it can implement   
some of the proposed reforms. "Unfortunately," says   
Hubbard, "the Clinton administration is fighting the state   
over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform."  
  <p>
The Family Independence Act redefines success for state   
agencies as "a shrinking caseload and an increase in the   
number of recipients placed in jobs," Hubbard continues.   
"Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months," and new   
applicants for welfare must "prove they have been looking   
for work." South Carolina goes to great lengths to facilitate   
that job search. "The state helps recipients relocate to areas   
with better job opportunities," for example, and offers   
employers "a tax credit for hiring and maintaining   
recipients." The program is practical rather than sentimental,   
however. "Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or   
guardian," says Hubbard, and fathers who fail to pay child   
support have their drivers licenses and other sporting and   
professional licenses revoked.

<h2>Welfare Reform/GA & OH</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Georgia and Ohio offer two examples of how states are  
moving toward welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in  
recent years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and  
contain too many exceptions to be truly effective," contends  
Kelly McCutchen of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation in  
Atlanta. Nevertheless, they have had an effect, combining  
with a bustling economy to reduce the welfare rolls by 6,000  
families in a single year. 
 <p>
"Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare  
system is the state's illegitimacy rate," says McCutchen in the  
May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the  
Capital Research Center. The state began to address this  
problem in 1994 by denying cash benefits "to unwed teen  
mothers who choose to live on their own," notes McCutchen.  
"The following year, the number of teen mothers living  
independently dropped by 50 percent." In 1996, the state  
stopped its perverse practice of increasing benefits "to  
welfare recipients who have additional children." 
 <p>
The state should not encourage illegitimacy, nor should it  
subsidize indolence. "Able-bodied welfare recipients who  
quit or refuse to take full-time jobs face a reduction in  
benefits,'' says McCutchen. Under the state's latest initiative,  
called Work First, Georgia is "advising social workers that  
finding jobs for recipients is their number-one objective. It is  
also offering businesses tax credits and subsidies, giving  
them an incentive to hire and train welfare recipients." 
 <p>
McCutchen argues that there are "three key elements of  
welfare reform." The first is establishment of paternity. "The  
state," she says, "must send a clear message to teenage boys  
that they will be held financially responsible for any children  
they engender." The second key element of welfare reform is  
benefit reduction. "Welfare recipients should not be better off  
than those who work," she says. The third element is a work  
requirement. "Welfare recipients must not be allowed to stay  
at home and collect benefits." The ultimate objective of  
welfare reform, however, is to get community-based  
organizations back in the driver's seat. "When government  
moved into social welfare," notes McCutchen, "other  
institutions -- families, businesses, churches, and charities --  
were shunted aside. They must once again assume primary  
roles." 
<p> 
In the same issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Samuel  
Staley and Douglas Hyne of the Buckeye Institute for Public  
Policy Solutions in Dayton report that General Assistance in  
Ohio "began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in  
1995. This has already saved the state $900 million," they  
observe. Ohio has also implemented a program called JOBS,  
which stands for Job Opportunities and Basic Skills. The  
program "requires a large number of welfare recipients to  
enroll in job-training programs. Refusal to participate results  
in a loss of welfare benefits,'' say Staley and Hyne.  
"Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts  
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for  
employment, Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are  
considered some of the toughest in the nation."

<h2>Anticipating "The Pacific Century"</h2>

     It's become faddish in our lifetimes to name each decade
     according to its defining characteristic. One presumptuous
     prognosticator has preempted this process by naming an entire
     century, before it begins.
<p>
     "During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has
     shifted," observes Jesse Helms. "And it will continue to move
     eastward away from Europe, toward Asia," says the senior Senator
     from North Carolina, "because, as the nations of Eastern Europe
     and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to
     break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking
     care of business at home." This historic shift will usher in what
     Helms calls "The Pacific Century."
<p>
     How will this affect America? It should redound to our benefit.
     "The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40
     percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has
     outpaced trade across the Atlantic," says Helms. "Thankfully for
     the United States -- though the political and economic center of
     gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we
     remain uniquely positioned . . . at the center. The United States
     thus remains the world's anchor."
<p>
     Senator Helms warns, however, that the United States "cannot be
     the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the
     world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the
     world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of
     the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and
     military might and right, an example towards which all others
     aspire."
<p>
     Current U.S. leadership is not setting that example. "In just a
     few short years, the Clinton administration has managed to warp
     U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United
     States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula.
     Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling
     ourselves down the road to irrelevance," says Helms. "In China,
     the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for
     dealing with areas of key interest to the United States. On the
     Korean peninsula, this administration has given lip service to
     our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North
     Koreans." Helms says the U.S. must preserve "its role in the
     dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and
     we must stand up for them."
<p>
     It is in America's best interests to "maintain open and peaceful
     shipping waters for trade" in the Pacific, says Helms. It is
     vitally important that we "maintain a strategic balance among
     China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia." It
     behooves us to "push for more open, less regulated markets for
     U.S. goods and services," and to "show the nations in the region
     that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and
     multilateral agreements." Helms stresses that we should
     "strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in
     the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather
     than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market
     share."

<h2>Big Government Destined For Ashbin</h2>


     Containing the threat, refuting the notion that its triumph was
     inevitable, seizing the moral high ground, defunding the enemy --
     these tactics toppled the Soviet empire and won the Cold War.
     They could also put an end to Big Government in America.
<p>
     "The old Republican coalition of northerners, big business,
     farmers, and professionals has given way to a modern Republican
     coalition of individuals and groups who share a common goal: They
     all want to be left alone by the government," says Grover
     Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in the May issue of
     Imprimis, the monthly publication of Hillsdale College. This
     "Leave Us Alone" coalition consists of taxpayers, property
     owners, small businessmen, gun owners, home schoolers, and other
     pro-family, traditional values conservatives -- all of whom want
     government out of their pockets and off their backs.
<p>
     "The Left as embodied in the Democratic Party is a 'Takings'
     coalition," says Norquist, "made up of groups that want the
     government to take things -- usually money -- from other
     Americans and give it to them. This coalition includes government
     workers, unions, government contractors, corrupt big-city
     machines, federal grant recipients, left-wing intellectuals, and
     both wings of the `dependency lobby' (those locked into welfare
     dependency and those who earn a handsome living managing that
     deliberately never-ending dependency)." This coalition is also
     home to "the radical utopians who wish to use the power of the
     state to restructure society. They include the radical leaders of
     the feminist, homosexual, environmentalist, and animal rights
     movements."
<p>
     The "Takings" coalition is shrinking. The "Leave Us Alone"
     coalition, on the other hand, continues to grow, built, as it is,
     "around a single political principle consistent with American
     history and tradition -- that government should be limited and
     the people free." Norquist says this coalition has "embarked
     consciously on a four-part strategy to defeat the Washington
     establishment and the old Democratic majority. It is the same
     strategy that successfully broke the back of the Soviet empire."
<p>
     As it applies to Big Government in America, containment means
     firm opposition to tax increases. Norquist notes that more and
     more of our elected representatives are getting on the tax-ban
     bandwagon. As for inevitability, it's not the triumph of
     socialism that looms before us, but "devolution of power to the
     states, a private Social Security system, school choice, and
     welfare reform." The Right succeeded in seizing the moral high
     ground with "principled opposition to the welfare state's
     destruction of lives." Defunding the enemy is all that remains.
     "Conservatives," Norquist observes, "are beginning to cut off the
     flow of tax-payer funds and coerced labor union dues to the
     Left."
<p>
     "Freedom is on the march around the globe," says Norquist. "There
     is a great deal of work to be done, but the imperial city of
     Washington will fall to the forces of freedom just as Moscow did.
     It is as hollow, as brittle, and as bereft of self-confidence.
     The 'Leave Us Alone' coalition is growing, and it is fighting on
     the winning side of history."

<title>Duplantier: Colorado's Amendment 2 -- 7/8/96</title>
</head>

July 8, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>Colorado's Amendment 2</h2>

<i>The Constitution of the United States says nothing about homosexuality. 
Under the 10th Amendment, therefore, any efforts to regulate 
manifestations of this conduct should be within the province of the states 
and the people.</i>
<p>
In his vigorous dissent from the Supreme Court's recent decision 
overturning Colorado's Amendment 2, Justice Antonin Scalia described 
the statewide ban on laws providing special treatment for homosexuals as 
"a modest attempt . . . to preserve traditional sexual mores against the 
efforts of a politically powerful minority." Scalia argued that the Court's 
ruling contradicts its own 1986 decision upholding Georgia's anti-
sodomy law "and places the prestige of this institution behind the 
proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial 
or religious bias."
<p>
The High Court ignored the question of "whether there was a legitimate 
rational basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment -- for the 
prohibition of special protection for homosexuals. It is unsurprising that 
the Court avoids discussion of this question," says Scalia, "since the 
answer is so obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue," he says, 
"is not even mentioned in the court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick, we 
held that the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all states had 
done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years -- making 
homosexual conduct a crime." Scalia points out the obvious 
contradiction: "If it is constitutionally permissible for a state to make 
homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for 
a state to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct."
<p>
Scalia argues that nothing in the Constitution "prohibits what Colorado 
has done here. But the case for Colorado is much stronger than that. What 
it has done is not only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable." He 
recalls how three Colorado cities "enacted ordinances that listed 'sexual 
orientation' as an impermissible ground for discrimination, equating the 
moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and religious 
bigotry." Conceding that "homosexuals are as entitled to use the legal 
system for reinforcement of their moral sentiments as are the rest of 
society," Scalia insists nevertheless that "they are subject to being 
countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as well. That is where 
Amendment 2 came in. It put directly, to all the citizens of the state, the 
question: Should homosexuality be given special protection? They 
answered no."
<p>
Scalia contends that the Supreme Court decision overturning Colorado's 
Amendment 2 "has no foundation in American constitutional law, and 
barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely 
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any 
substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. 
Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the 
sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an 
appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans 
have employed before. Striking it down is an act not of judicial judgment, 
but of political will."

<h2>
Property Rights
</h2>

<i>"Property is power. If the government owned or controlled all the 
property, it would possess all the power."</i>
<p>
The League of Private Property Voters periodically releases an index 
recording Congressional votes relating to property rights and rating our 
elected representatives according to their respect for private property. 
"There was a major change in Congress in 1994 and private property 
rights continued to grow as a major political issue during the first half of 
the 104th Congress," reports the League. "Consequently, more and more 
politicians climbed on the bandwagon and proclaimed steadfast support 
of property rights." In their 1995-96 Private Property Vote Index, 
recording 15 House votes and 10 Senate votes, the League documents "a 
dramatic improvement in the House of Representatives, with a modest 
gain in the Senate in the 104th Congress. Private property rights were a 
significant part of the Contract With America in the House," the League 
explains. "However, the Senate slowed progress down significantly."
<p>
The change of party control in Congress brought "many more private 
property advocates into committee chairmanships and other positions of 
power. However, there was a powerful split between Western private 
property advocates and Eastern representatives, who generally have a 
lower awareness of the vital nature of private property rights." The 
League reports that the House and Senate passed bills restricting the use 
of unfunded mandates, thereby slowing "the massive increase in Federal 
regulations which invariably lead to 'taking' private property rights. But 
in the area of regulatory reform, risk assessment, private property rights, 
and wetlands compensation, fast House action was faced with a stonewall 
in the Senate." The League contends that there is "a groundswell of 
support to reform the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 wetlands 
regulations," but warns that "the Green advocacy groups have mounted a 
well-financed counter offensive with great success."
<p>
The League argues that "secure and enforceable property rights are 
necessary for civil order. When property ownership becomes vague and 
unsettled, strife and social breakdown soon follow." The League notes 
that "our free market economy is based on secure and enforceable 
property rights." They point out that "private property is what allows 
people to pursue their own goals, independent of the state or society." 
Contrary to what many people think, private property rights are also 
necessary for the protection of the environment. "When people own 
resources in common, they take as much as they can as quickly as they 
can," the League observes. "Many of the professional environmental 
pressure groups often deny the crucial role of property rights in 
protecting the environment. That is because political power means more 
to them than the health of the environment."
<p>
The League points out that "our system of limited government, including 
our constitutional rights, survives because of the widespread ownership 
of property." If it were not for this widespread ownership, "our 
constitutional rights would become mere paper rights, unenforceable 
against an all-powerful government. That is why the protection of private 
property rights should concern all Americans, whether they own property 
or not."

<title>Duplantier: On-The-Job Training -- 7/12/96</title>

<h2>
On-The-Job Training
</h2>

<i>The experience a person gains on the job is often worth far more than 
the wages he receives.</i>
<p>
"Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous 
executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and 
employees," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation in the June 
issue of Policy Review. "Others say that inexorable economic and social 
trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects 
for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education." 
There is general agreement, however, "that America must raise the 
educational levels of its workers. But would-be reformers," says Hood, 
"often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is 
neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the 
education and training workers receive from their employers or in the 
private marketplace."
<p>
Almost every workplace in America offers endless opportunities for 
"lifelong learning." All that's needed is the gumption to take advantage of 
them. "Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving 
strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job," says 
Hood. "Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many 
businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long 
run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher 
wages." Hood reports that "about 50 million workers received some kind 
of formal training" in 1995, at a cost to their employers of more than $50 
billion. Throw in another $300 billion in informal training, and you've 
got a sizable investment in the American worker.
<p>
This is a win-win situation for employers and employees. "Workers who 
become more skilled in their jobs are more productive," observes Hood. 
"Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce 
turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more 
valuable at the firm where they were acquired." College graduates who 
rest on their laurels often find themselves earning less than "workers 
without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training 
for their jobs."
<p>
Of course, employees who lack a basic education and a decent work ethic 
are not likely to benefit no matter how much money is spent on them. 
"Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or 
no marketable skills," says Hood. "The problem is one of wasted 
resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but 
often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training 
later on. Government sponsored job-training programs have consistently 
posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they 
spent."
<p>
John Hood argues that "federal and state subsidies encourage students to 
pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally 
guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to 
enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time 
students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and 
university classes," he suggests, "might be better spent finding an 
employer that teaches useful skills."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part I
</h2>

<i>1994 was a watershed year for Republicans, but that dramatic 
Congressional election may have less impact than the changes made on 
the state level.</i>
<p>
"Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has 
focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats 
in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, 
the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time 
in 40 years," observes Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. 
"Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance 
in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats 
(with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 
Democrats."
<p>
Norquist acknowledges the tremendous impact on national politics of this 
party realignment, but insists, nevertheless, that Washington is not where 
the action is. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist argues 
that "the intense focus on Washington DC has obscured the conservative 
revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state 
capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the 
Beltway," he contends. "Conservative reforms at the state level make 
similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. 
The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march 
ahead even if the revolution in Washington stalls."
<p>
Norquist contends that "the 1994 shift in partisan control was more 
pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans 
won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in 
their column from 19 to 30," he reports. The vast majority of Americans 
"now live in states with Republican governors." This historic, 
comprehensive realignment "affects the content of the policy debate in at 
least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more 
autonomy," says Norquist. "Second, a Republican Congress is more 
likely to fulfill its commitment to 'devolution' knowing that ideologically 
sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states."
<p>
The example of reform-minded Governors, who practice what they 
preach about cutting big government, may be just what our Congressmen 
need to help them stick to their guns. "In Washington, political reform 
has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen," 
observes Grover Norquist. "Of the Contract with America's 10 specific 
items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in 
the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, 
which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon 
business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, 
regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down 
or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, 
and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto."
<p>
The states are having more success. "The new generation of Republican 
governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform 
agenda," says Norquist, "from tax cuts to tort reform."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part II
</h2>

<i>Don't be frustrated by the slow pace of political reform in our nation 's 
capital. Take heart in the dramatic progress being made by our sovereign 
states.</i>
<p>
"In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child 
tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with 
Republican governors cut taxes," reports Grover Norquist of Americans 
for Tax Reform. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist 
notes that, last year, "12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest 
Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While 
Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous 
stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides."
<p>
Tax reform and tort reform are just two of the many historic changes now 
occurring throughout these United States. "The latest Republican anti-
crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate 
has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House," says 
Norquist. "Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting 
'truth-in-sentencing' laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentences. " A majority of states have also passed 
legislation allowing for the carrying of concealed handguns.
<p>
The states are not waiting for Washington to reform welfare and health 
care, either. "Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-
reform bill," says Norquist, "Republican governors continue to 
experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of 
welfare." Clinton may have vetoed Medicare reform and Medical Savings 
Accounts, but five Republican governors "shepherded Medical Savings 
Accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based 
health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and 
insurance premiums," says Norquist, "contributing substantially to the 
debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, 
when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will 
already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it."
<p>
The states are also outpacing Congress in providing protection for 
property rights. "In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution 
is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of 
private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by 
government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course," notes 
Norquist, but that hasn't stopped the states from pushing ahead. 
"Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the 
property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted 
legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way."
<p>
Our sovereign states seem to be asserting themselves once again. This 
bodes well for America. "All the Republican governors are traveling in 
the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special 
interests of the old establishment order," says Grover Norquist. They've 
declared war on the welfare state, and they're not taking any prisoners.

<h2>
Gambling
</h2>

<i>"Roughly three-quarters of all Americans now gamble -- and they have 
an abundance of venues from which to try their luck. Presently 48 of the 
50 states allow one or more forms of legalized gambling."</i>
<p>
"More and more state governments have seized upon legalized gambling 
as a revenue-generating gold mine -- a voluntary tax willingly paid out by 
citizens enamored with visions of quick riches," says Robert Reno of 
Focus on the Family. "This development has reversed government's 
historic position as a gambling regulator. Instead, state governments are 
now pouring resources into promotion and marketing, attempting to 
induce citizens to gamble." Once hooked on the tamer forms of gaming, 
state governments soon lose their resistance to the more intense forms. "A 
state's initial foray into the gambling arena is frequently via a lottery," 
notes Reno. "After an initial flurry of activity, revenues from the lottery 
begin to decline. However, the state becomes increasingly dependent on 
gambling revenues, and therefore must offer other, more attractive, ways 
to entice citizens to part with their money." Reno points out that, "by 
introducing the lottery, government also expands the potential market for 
other gambling ventures." Research shows that "gambling participation 
rates increased sharply as states increased the number of forms of 
gambling allowed."
<p>
Politicians make a lot of extravagant promises to justify the legalization 
of gambling, but somehow the promises don't pan out. "Gambling 
proponents in government frequently justify their stance by noting that a 
significant portion of the proceeds are earmarked for education, public 
works, or other such projects intended to benefit communities," observes 
Robert Reno. "However, they often fail to mention both the unreliability 
of gambling as a revenue source . . . and the fact that diverting gambling 
funds to such projects often yields little, if any, net gain in funding for 
those projects."
<p>
Reno confirms that "the introduction of gambling on a widespread basis 
correlates with a marked increase in crime." For one thing, "gambling 
tends to attract a criminal element." For another, problem gamblers 
frequently "turn to crime to finance their involvement." Researcher 
Robert Reno notes that "one of the alleged benefits often cited by 
proponents of legalized gambling" is that it allows state governments to 
"undercut illegal gambling and thus hinder organized crime." Au 
contraire! "By enlarging the pool of bettors and, at the same time, 
reducing gambling's stigma," says Reno, "the state actually creates an 
increased market for illegal gambling activities."
<p>
Gambling is not the economic godsend the hucksters would have us 
believe. In fact, says Robert Reno, "the net economic effects are often 
negative." That's because "gambling-related jobs tend to be low-paying; 
other businesses suffer from the introduction of gambling; and gambling 
is associated with a host of costly social problems." What does gambling 
really offer? "A legacy of broken families and shattered lives," says 
Reno, "not to mention a price tag to society that runs into the billions of 
dollars. The government's present infatuation with and promotion of 
gambling," he concludes, "is unconscionable in light of the devastation."

<h2>
America's Future's Record
</h2>

<i>America's future depends on Americans who believe in America. That's 
why America's Future was founded fifty years ago!</i>
<p>
When America's Future was founded, fifty years ago, the Second World 
War had just concluded and the United Nations had just been born. The 
Cold War had not yet begun, and neither had the conservative movement. 
Fifty years ago, there were only a handful of conservative, 
constitutionalist, free-market-oriented organizations and publications. But 
the number of liberal, leftist, and crypt )communist groups in America 
numbered more than a thousand.
<p>
Our nation was in transition in 1946, and our enemies were well-
organized. Stouthearted individuals and intrepid organizations were 
needed to defend the American way of life. And so, on April 24, 1946, 
America's Future, a nonprofit educational organization, was founded in 
New York City by a group of businessmen dedicated to the preservation 
of two great fundamental American principles: the competitive, private 
enterprise system that has made our country strong and prosperous, and 
the constitutional form of government that has kept us free from the 
tyranny of dictators or factions.
<p>
From the very beginning, America's Future concentrated its educational 
efforts on the proverbial man-on-the-fence, the uncommitted millions, 
students eager to learn about their country and its traditions, educators 
and ministers (who are the prime targets of the collectivists), parents 
concerned about the future of their children, workers who have benefited 
from the free enterprise system, and voters who control the destiny of our 
nation. Beginning in 1946, America's Future sponsored and produced 
over the ABC Radio Network a Sunday afternoon commentary featuring 
Congressman Samuel Pettengill, a renowned constitutionalist. We also 
began publishing and distributing pro-American books, pamphlets, and 
reprints (now numbering in the millions).
<p>
In the 1950s, one of the country's most influential print and broadcast 
commentators, John T. Flynn, joined forces with America's Future. Flynn 
was a frequent contributor to prestigious national magazines; and his 
book, The Road Ahead, which showed how socialism was creeping 
across England and the United States, sold more than one million copies. 
Flynn pulled no punches. He went behind the headlines to explain the 
real significance of events and personalities. He attacked Big 
Government and Big Business with equal vigor, always from the 
perspective of an unwavering, unapologetic Americanism. His 
commentaries for America's Future, aptly named "Behind The 
Headlines," were soon being broadcast on more than 300 radio stations in 
the Mutual Broadcasting System. Commentaries by Flynn were also 
distributed to thousands of newspapers across the country, with an 
estimated readership of twenty million.
<p>
That's how America's Future began, fifty years ago. Today, with the vast 
majority of Americans now identifying themselves as conservatives and 
the liberal welfare state discredited, we like to think that we can claim 
some of the credit, and we invite you to join us in celebrating the Golden 
Anniversary of America's Future.

<h2>
John T. Flynn on Socialism
</h2>

<i>The former managing editor of the New York Globe, John T. Flynn was 
a frequent contributor to America's most prestigious magazines, the best-
selling author of several books on the evils of socialism, and the 
originator of our Behind The Headlines commentaries.</i>
<p>
"A socialist society cannot be organized and conducted by the federal 
government under our Constitution," wrote John T. Flynn in his book 
called The Decline of the American Republic, And How to Rebuild It, 
republished in condensed form in 1957 in America's Future's All-
American Book Digest. "There is not one sentence in the Constitution," 
said Flynn, "that would authorize the federal government to socialize our 
medical facilities, to regulate or finance our schools, to engage in 
industrial or mercantile enterprise, or to carry on any of that multitude of 
activities which have, as a matter of record, brought the federal 
government into almost every kind of business in one degree or another. 
The great limitations on the federal government; were specifically set 
down in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn pointed out that the Constitution was designed "to bring into 
existence a government that possessed all the powers necessary to defend 
the nation from foreign enemies and to guarantee to all the citizens 
certain great fundamental rights of freemen, and to leave to the states -- 
the several small republics -- the powers essential to the government of a 
free people." The Constitution thus stood as an insurmountable barrier to 
power-hungry socialists -until Franklin Delano Roosevelt acceded to the 
presidency. "Despite all the endless care exercised by the framers of the 
Constitution, and the judgments of the Courts for 148 years," Flynn 
lamented, "the revolutionary elements in the United States found a way in 
which to complete their perversion and subversion of the Constitution 
without submitting these radical changes to the states [which were] the 
only authority empowered to make changes in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn explained how this was accomplished: "The Supreme Court is 
empowered, under the Constitution, to 'interpret' the meaning of the 
Constitution where questions of judicial differences appear," he observed. 
"It had, according to its time-honored practice, interpreted the 
Constitution to mean what its framers wanted it to mean. There was, 
therefore, but one course open to the revolutionary cabal in Washington. 
It was a plan to change the Constitution, literally to wreck the whole 
fundamental structure of the American government . . . by judicial 
interpretation."
<p>
And so, the safeguards were discarded, and America got its taste of 
socialism. "The vast and compulsive apparatus of government had been 
dismembered by our forefathers and its various parts entrusted to a 
variety of agencies," observed John T. Flynn, to ensure that our federal 
government would never have "sufficient power to oppress the citizen." 
But the power that our Founding Fathers so wisely divided was 
recombined "by the decisions of a group of judges who were put on the 
bench in a revolutionary maneuver to give to words in the Constitution 
wholly new meanings."

<title>Duplantier: World Heritage Areas -- 8/8/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a><br>
August 8, 1996</i><br><p>
<h2>WORLD HERITAGE AREAS</h2>

<i>Did you know that the United Nations has sovereign control over 
Yellowstone Park? That's right, the UN, for all practical purposes, owns 
Yellowstone National Park!</i>
<p>
World-famous Yellowstone Park in Montana was visited by UN officials 
last fall, but they weren't there on vacation! Tom Deweese of the 
American Policy Center reports that these internationalist bureaucrats 
were "inspecting a site for a proposed gold mine . . . located on property 
outside of the Yellowstone National Park boundaries." In a recent issue of 
his group's newsletter, called Insider's Report, Deweese revealed what 
these world-governing wannabes were up to. "Radical environmentalists 
who oppose the mine development deliberately brought the UN into the 
debate in an attempt to stop it," he explained. "The decision of the UN 
site inspectors will determine if the mine may be developed. Their 
decision will end the debate."<p>

You heard correctly. This isn't some paranoid, futuristic fantasy. It's real, 
and it's happening right now. The UN is deciding whether or not 
American citizens have the right to put their own property to productive 
use. "What does the United Nations have to do with determining how 
land is used inside United States territory?" you ask. Deweese provides 
the shocking answer. "The United Nations," he says, "has sovereign 
control of Yellowstone Park."<p>

According to Deweese, radical environmentalists "invoked a little known 
treaty called the World Heritage Convention in order to involve the 
United Nations in an internal United States dispute. Jimmy Carter, in 
1978, signed the treaty and thereby designated Yellowstone a World 
Heritage Site. Now the United Nations has ultimate say in what happens 
to the park." Though not on park land, the site of the proposed mine 
happens to fall into the treaty-mandated "buffer zone."<p>

"There are several more World Heritage Sites within U.S. borders," 
observes Deweese. And, if you're not scandalized already, you will be, 
when you hear what two of them are: the Statue of Liberty in New York 
harbor and Independence Hall in Philadelphia! "That's right," says 
Deweese; "the United Nations controls the spot where America's 
Founding Fathers created our nation." In other words, authority over the 
two most famous symbols of our freedom has been ceded to an 
organization that seeks to destroy that freedom.<p>

"The World Heritage Convention is just one of a series of treaties that the 
United States has signed in the past few decades that grant control to the 
United Nations over U.S. law," Deweese points out. "Most of these 
treaties now have programs already in place to grab U.S. soil. And son e 
of these programs are much worse than just taking our nation's 
landmarks. Some have targeted all of the private property in the nation. 
That means your home." Perhaps the worst offender is the UN 
Convention on Biological Diversity, which, Tom Deweese charges, "lays 
down the plans for a 'reversal' of the process of civilization, ultimately 
overseeing the herding of people into pre-selected, isolated enclaves, 
while the rest of America becomes vast wilderness."<p>

F. R. Duplantier</a><br>    
August 9, 1996</i><br><p> 
<h2> PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
<i>"The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on 
to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered 
Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act, or to effect 
some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains 
property owners from using their property as they wish. "</i>
<p>
"Although the United States was founded on the principle that 
government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on 
law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a 
loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation," observes 
John Shanahan of the Heritage Foundation. "These regulatory takings can 
strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some 
cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and, with it, 
the life savings of individual citizens."
<p>
The Private Property Protection Act of 1995, passed by the House last 
year, "would require compensation by the regulating federal agency 
whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered 
Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent 
of the value of the regulated parcel," observes Shanahan. The Omnibus 
Property Rights Act of 1995, now under consideration in the Senate, 
"would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever 
the taking of some 'portion' of property diminishes the value by 33 
percent."
<p>
Both bills seek to reinforce the U.S. Constitution's unambiguous 
endorsement of property rights. "The Fifth Amendment implicitly 
recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use," 
concedes Shanahan, but "explicitly mandates that government must pay 
the property owner for the land confiscated." It thereby "ensures that the 
cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen 
unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires." Any 
federal regulation that deprives an American citizen of the full use of his 
property violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. "Just 
compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights," 
argues Shanahan, noting that "property rights are essential to preventing 
the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution."
<p>
Imagine the consequences if there were no Fifth Amendment. "If 
government had a free hand to take property without payment, the 
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit 
would be overwhelming," says Shanahan. "In fact, that is exactly what 
has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of 
America's land, with even higher percentages in the West, and is using 
regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective 
control over even more extensive tracts."
<p>
Compensation requirements are needed to discourage the federal 
government from confiscating property. The problem today, says John 
Shanahan, is that "federal enforcement officials have found that they can 
use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just 
compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights 
legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal 
regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property."

 <i> September 5, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NEA Resolutions </h2><p>                           




<i>The National Education Association maintains one of thefive largest federal Political Action Committees in the country. The teachers union donated 99 percent of its PAC money to the Democrats in 1994 It's important to know, then, where this influential group stands on various issues.</i><p>


Ninety-one percent of the nine thousand delegates attending the NEA convention in Washington DC over the July Fourth weekend voted to endorse Bill Clinton for reelection as President of the United States. Clinton was on hand to accept the NEA's Friend of Education Award, and to present his plan for education reform, which included Internet access for every public school classroom in America, tax credits for anyone wanting to attend a-cornmunity college, and a $10 million program to combat truancy. The President proposed financial penalties for mothers and fathers who miss parent-teacher conferences, or whose children skip classes. He also recommended that the government provide "intensive counseling" for such parents.<p>

Resolutions approved at the 1996 NEA Convention were more circumspect than last year's bombshells, but they still exhibited hostility to traditional values and the rights of parents. Needless to say, the delegates called for increased federal funding for public education, in particular for programs designed to alleviate "sexual orientation discrimination." They argued that the "immigration status of students or their parents" should have no bearing on eligibility for public school attendance. And they insisted that privatization, performance contracting, tuition tax credits, and voucher plans are "detrimental to public education and must be eliminated."<p>

NEA delegates endorsed "early childhood education programs in the public schools for children from birth through age eight." Such programs would include "a full continuum of services for parents and children, including child care, child development, developmentally appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education. and anorooriate bias-free screening devices."<p>

 

NEA delegates asserted an "increasingly important role" for public schools in providing sex education. "Teachers and health professionals," they contend, "must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits." Otherwise, they might have to think twice about offering instruction in birth control usage and perverted sexual techniques. "To facilitate the realization of human potential," the delegates proclaimed, "it is the right of every individual to live in an environment of freely available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality." The delegates also called for "comprehensive AIDS education programs as an integral part of the school curriculum."<p>

The NEA insists that homeschooling students "meet all state requirements. Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used." Less adamant about holding its own members responsible, the teachers union opposes "standardized testing that is mandated by local, state, or national authority [and] the use of these tests to compare one student, staff member, school, or district with another." Not surprisingly, NEA delegates resolved that "competency testing must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Separating School & State -- 9/06/96</title>

<h2> Separating School & State </h2><p>                           



<i>The federal government doesn't run the churches in America Why should it run the schools?</i><p>

"In America, we don't use the government to run the churches; and, considering our diversity, we have admirable religious harmony," observes Marshall Fritz in the July issue of The Freeman. Fritz believes that "this 'hands-off" policy is America's greatest gift to the human race." He recommends that the policy be extended to the field of education, as well, calling for "the separation of school and state."<p>

A former Christian school principal, Fritz is the founder of the Separation of School and State Alliance, which advocates the dismantling of the public school system in America. "People have long pondered why parent-funded private schools seem to work fairly well . . . and tax-funded public schools seem to be going downhill at an increasing speed," Fritz remarks. "In fact, public-school educators are scrambling to imitate the non-essential features of private schools. Some call for uniforms, son e want 'values' programs, all clamor for fewer layers of administration in their hopes to reverse their downward plunge. The stampede has gone so far that even union leaders are calling for . . . 'more choice and market dynamics."' They just don't get it, says Fritz. "In their call for 'market dynamics,' union leaders miss the real secret of success of parent-funded schools: parental responsibility."<p>

This, Fritz declares, is "the key difference between tax-funded and parent-funded schools. Parent-funded schools have a high percentage of parents who are fully exercising their parental rights in education, and tax-funded schools have few such parents." Fritz explains that "parents who directly provide for their children's education sacrifice. That act both reflects and influences their attitude about their children's education. In contrast, paying taxes . . . is neither investment nor sacrifice. One is not deferring gratificat on, but merely avoiding pain. Coercion is central to the financing of tax-funded schools," Fritz contends, "whereas deferred gratification, usually based on hope and love, is the financing source of parent-funded schools."<p>

Fritz argues that government, as "the great enabler of irresponsibility and dependence," has created "an epidemic of parental irresponsibility." Nor will parents learn to be responsible again until they are forced to "pay the price of irresponsibility." Fritz argues that parent-funded schools succeed because they "have love as part of their culture; it starts with their financing. Tax-funded schools have coercion as part of their culture; it also starts with their financing. In education, like so much of life, love works. Coercion doesn't."<p>

While recognizing that "our forebears had the wisdom and courage to end government-compelled church funding, attendance, and practice," Marshall Fritz says we should go them one step better and prohibit government from "compelling school funding, attendance, and curriculum. Only with the separation of school and state," says Fritz, "can we re-establish parental responsibility, protect parents' rights, and enable schools, teachers, and students to flourish in an environment of educational freedom."<p>

<h2> Environmental Facts </h2><p>                           


<i>When it comes to environmentalism, the popular wisdom, more often than not, is wrong</i><p>



Pollution is a growing problem, right? Wrong! "The environment is cleaner than at any time in the past halfcentury," observes Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "The average American [today] is exposed to fewer potentially harmful pollutants than at any time since the 1930s. Air and water pollution, which had risen during the 1940s and 1950s, have fallen consistently and considerably since that time. Today, pollution of all kinds is responsible for less than 1 percent of cancer deaths."<p>

Speaking of cancer, aren't cancer rates going up and up? Actually, they're not. "Cancer rates are falling, not rising," says Bast. "We've lived with pesticides, automobiles, and electromagnetic fields for nearly a century. During this period, overall cancer rates among the non-elderly population went down, not up. Cancer rates among the elderly appear to have increased, but this is due partly to better diagnosis and partly to the rapid decline of other causes of death."<p>

So, maybe we're healthier and we're living longer, but an environmental cataclysm is bound to occur eventually, right? Wrong again. "Predictions of impending global ecological disasters are untrue. There is no scientific validity to claims that acid rain, global warming, deforestation, or ozone depletion will cause global environmental disasters at any time in the future," says Bast. "Most environmental problems have been or are being solved. Automobile emissions, for example, have been reduced by 90 to 97 percent during the past twenty years. The threats of deforestation and resource depletion have been eliminated from the developed countries of the world, and remain problems only in Third World countries torn by civil war and acute poverty. Oil spills are less common and cause less ecological harm than in the past. Landfill technology has advanced 'dramatically' in the past decade."<p>

But aren't our resources running out? Won't we have to learn to live with less? No to both questions. "Innovation and the use of reason to solve problems, not any change in human nature or in the amount of natural resources, make us wealthier than our grandparents," says Bast. "The 'gloom and doom' school of thought within the environmental movement systematically overlooks the role of ideas in finding new resources, managing waste, and protecting human health and the environment. Their zero-sum solutions are unnecessary and often don't work."<p>

Prosperity is a mixed blessing, though, isn't it? Not at a 1. "Prosperity is good for the environment," says Joseph Bast. "The fear that prosperity leads to environmentat destruction saturates the literature of the environmental movement. But prosperity has made it possible for us to invest in parks and wildlife preserves, clean our air and water, and treat or store our wastes," says Bast. "Prosperity is not only compatible with a clean environment; it is environmental protection's necessary precondition."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Environmental Logic -- 9/10/96</title>

 <i> September 10, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Logic </h2><p>


<i>Protecting the- environment requires accurate information and sound reasoning When environmentalism degenerates into sentimentalism, it winds up doing more harm than good.</i><p>




Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute charges that "the biggest barrier to improving environmental protection . . . is the environmental movement itself." Co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism, Bast argues that "the lack of understanding and critical thinking on the part of most environmentalists has compromised the movement's ability to be an effective force for environmental protection. The popular wisdom on issue after issue," he contends, "bears little resemblance to what objective scientists have to say." As a result, "many environmentalists are wasting their energy -- and the dollars of consumers, businesses, and taxpayers -- fighting nonexistent problems or problems that already are being solved, while bigger problems go unnoticed."<p>

Bast offers a quick course in critical thinking. Lesson Number One: "Correlation is not causation," he says. "Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean one is causing the other. We need proof, including a reasonable theory showing the path by which one thing causes another to occur. Most environmental scares -including global warming, electromagnetic fields, and dioxin -- resulted when the correlation of two things was mistaken for causation."<p>

Lesson Number Two: "Not everything can be explained. The truth," says Bast, "is that the causes of most specific cases of cancer, miscarriage, and child deformity in the U.S. are unexplained." He points out that "the victims of these afflictions" are not necessarily "experts on the causes of their illnesses. A victim's guess is no more reliable, and may be less reliable, than the guesses of any other nonexpert."<p>

Lesson Number Three: "Trends can't predict the future. During the 1 970s, global temperatures fell several years in a row and [so-called] 'experts' . . . predicted a new ice age," recalls Bast. "During the 1980s, temperatures rose several years in a row and the 'experts' . . . predicted catastrophic global warming."<p>

Lesson Number Four: "We can never avoid risk completely. Everything we do carries with it some risk," says Bast. "There is no such thing as a product, decision, or action that carries no risk whatsoever. Keep in mind that the risks of drowning (16 in a million), or dying in an accident at home (90 in a million), or dying in an automobile accident (192 in a million) greatly exceed the alleged environmental risks being decried by some organizations."<p>

Last Lesson: "We have to make choices," says Joseph Bast, even when it comes to protecting the environment. "We have to choose among different ways to do it. We can't do everything, all at once, because trying to do so would be extremely wasteful, unnecessarily injure many people, and probably produce unintended consequences that harm the environment. Instead, we must apply the same prudence that we apply to other important parts of our lives. The importance of environmental issues doesn't somehow exempt them from this discipline. In fact, their importance makes careful planning and efficiency all the more necessary."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Environmental Science  -- 9/11/96</title> 
</head> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<b>Behind the Headlines</b><br> 
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br> 
<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br> 
 <i> September 11 , 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Science </h2><p>

<i>Any environmentalist who rejects the scientific method, and the objective truth it leads to, obviously has some other agenda than protecting the environment.<i><p>


"Some environmental groups insist that, unless a substance or action can be 'proven to be harmless' to human health or the environment, it should be restricted or banned. This is an impossible standard to meet," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute. "It is impossible to prove that something does not exist."<p>

This is but one of the many scientific lessons offered in a new book, co-authored by Bast, called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism. The nature of toxicity is another. "The dose makes the poison," says Bast. "Some chemicals can be highly toxic, so it is natural for us to be concerned about their possible effects on human health and the environment. But the real, as opposed to the hypothetical, threat posed by a substance depends on our exposure to the substance, or its dose. Many toxic substances, both man-made and natural, are present in the air, water, and our food, but they are present in such small amounts that only recently have we invented the tools needed to discover their presence. There is little convincing evidence that these substances pose any threat to human health at current levels of exposure."<p>

Extrapolating the results of an experiment from one specises to another may be ill-advised. "Mice are not little men," says Bast. "Experiments on laboratory animals are valuable ways of measuring a chemical's toxicity or its likely effects on wildlife. But such experiments fail to accurately assess human cancer risks. The enormous doses fed to laboratory animals cause tissue damage and stress, which can lead to tumors even if the substance being tested is not carcinogenic at normal doses. Animal tests also assume that mice and humans respond the same way to chemicals, even though mice sometimes respond to chemicals very differently than rats and guinea pigs."<p>

Risk is a relative -- not an either-or -- proposition. "Risks can be measured and ranked," says Bast. "Researchers can measure and compare the risks associated with different courses of action." Reasonable estimates can be used to "rank environmental problems according to how much risk they pose to the environment or our health. This, in turn, helps us prioritize problems and decide where our limited resources would be best spent."<p>

Bias can skew the results of any research effort. "Science is not immune to politics," says Bast. "Most scientific research taking place in American universities is subsidized by the government, which means it is influenced by politics. Some scientists have political beliefs or loyalties that influence their views, especially on subjects outside their area of technical training." A report issued by an independent scientist is "less likely to be politicized" than one issued by a government agency, Bast observes. Either one, however, should be subjected to peer review. Environmental research must not be exempted from rigorous scientific standards.<p>

<h2> Environmental Economics </h2><p>


<i>The free market can protect the environment far better than any government can, so why not take advantage of it?<i><p>



People will take care of the environment voluntarily if they have sufficient incentive for doing so. Property rights provide that incentive. "A property rights strategy works through incentives; government intervention relies on commands," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "Ownership leads to better stewardship. We tend to take better care of things we own than of things we only rent or borrow," says Bast. "Natural resources, therefore, are better cared for if they are owned by the people who use them." Not surprisingly, governments tend to prefer a coercive approach, which requires a monitoring system and "an apparatus to punish those who attempt to evade the commands."<p>

For governments, of course, coercion can be an end in itself. The sincere environmentalist, however, has no excuse for succumbing to the totalitarian temptation, once he realizes that compulsion is counterproductive. "Pollution problems occur where rights are not defined and enforced," says Bast. "When things are privately owned, the civil justice system keeps us from invading or damaging them. But, when they are owned in common . . . we are often driven by competition with others to exploit them quickly and with little regard for their future value. The result is often pollution, unsustainable rates of development, and endangerment of wildlife."<p>

The free exchange of the free market "can help solve environmental problems," says Bast. "Transferable property rights enable those who value a resource most highly to bid it away from those who value it less. Potential buyers -for example, nonprofit organizations and clubs devoted to conservation -- can use their property rights to purchase or lease land, reward good stewardship, or purchase covenants that restrict allowable uses of land. Such exchanges reveal the true cost of protecting the environment and ensure that this cost is shared by those who value the environment most."<p>

Because they do not operate according to free-market principles, governments inevitably harm the environment. "Government officials seeks to expand their budgets and authority by delivering short-term benefits to special interest groups," says Bast. "Because they do not own the resources they manage, these officials are unlikely to manage them for maximum asset value." Government' i monopoly status prevents it from comparing "its own efficiency to that of competing organizations. As a result, government agents cannot know how good a job they are doing -- or how much harm they are causing."<p>

The free market encourages efficiency, and that's good for the environment. ''Efficiency means producing the most output with the least input," says Joseph Bast. "Over time, a system that rewards efficiency will also tend to produce less pollution than one that tolerates inefficiency.'' Governments, on the other hand, are notoriously inefficient, and their inefficiency leads to waste and pollution. Environmentalists without hidden agendas should recognize the superiority of the free-market approach.<p>

<h2> Recycling </h2><p>



<i>There are more than 7000 curbside recycling programs in the United States, with more than 100 million Americans participating. Two questions need to be asked, however: Do these programs work? Are they cost-effective?</i><p>

"Americans seem to be having a love affair with recycling," observes writer Harvey Black in a recent issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. "No longer do people simply look for a refuse container to toss away a used soda can or plastic bottle. They search for the right recycling receptacle. All over the United States, when it's time to take out the garbage, millions of people take out carefully sorted bundles of newspapers and cardboard, bags of aluminum and steel cans, and plastic containers -- all destined for recycling."<p>

The question is, does all this extra effort make any sense? In his article, entitled "Rethinking Recycling," which was reprinted by the Heartland Institute as an antidote to Earth Day propaganda, Black reports that "a number of economists and policy analysts have questioned whether the benefits of recycling outweigh the ease of disposing of waste materials in landfills. Critics say that what seems at first to make a great deal of sense doesn't always stand up to a close examination. For instance, some critics argue that collection costs make recycling a bad bargain for many localities because the costs often exceed the prices that the recyclables bring on the open market. They also charge that operating additional trucks to pick up recyclables increases toxic diesel emissions, offsetting any environmental gains."<p>

Black notes that "forms of recycling have been in use in the United States for almost 100 years At the turn of the century," he observes, "waste paper and rags were used to make new paper when wood pulp was scarce or too expensive. Recycling scrap metal and other materials was an American institution during World War II. And deposits on glass soda bottles in the 1950s and 1960s encouraged people to recycle and reuse them."<p>

These traditional forms of recycling all made economic sense at the time. "When the modern version of recycling began," says Black, "its economics were disastrous in some cases." He explains that "the economics of recycling is a mosaic of issues including collection costs, market demand, landfill costs, and recycling infrastructure and technology. Determining whether recycling makes economic sense involves analyzing these components to see how they fit into the total picture."<p>

Such considerations "may seem complex," concedes Harvey Black, "but they are at least somewhat quantifiable. The health and environmental benefits of recycling -- including energy conservation, toxic emissions reductions, and preservation of resources -- are far more difficult to quantify. Health and environmental benefits are somewhat indirect and are valued differently from individual to individual. Still, advocates of recycling argue that the more intangible benefits offer the most compelling case for recycling." Could it be that they simply don't understand economics, or do they just prefer not to have their efforts measured by an objective standard?<p>

<h2>The Argument Against Gun Control</h2> </center><p>
  
America cannot remain the land of the free unless it continues to be the  
home of the brave. <p> 
 
  
Fueled by anti-gun hysteria, the drive to disarm America gathered  
momentum with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther  
King Jr. in 1968, the year that saw passage of the Gun Control Act. It   
neared its logical conclusion in 1981 when the Village Board of Morton  
Grove, Illinois banned the possession of all handguns and attempted to  
compel local citizens to surrender their weapons to the police. But, in the  
following year, the pendulum began to swing back the other way. In 1982  
the city council of Kennesaw. Georgia voted unanimously to require the  
head of every household to own a gun and ammunition. That year the  
incidence of burglary went down 73 percent in Kennesaw. Meanwhile, it  
was going up in Morton Grove.  <p>
  
Whether their motivation is a sincere desire to reduce the incidence of  
homicide, or a determination to render patriotic Americans defenseless,  
advocates of gun control have trouble advancing credible arguments on  
its behalf, relying instead on emotional appeals and exploiting every gun- 
related tragedy. What else can they do when FBI statistics show that most  
of the states with the highest murder rates have extensive gun control.  
while most of the states with the lowest murder rates have little or no gun  
control?  <p>
  
The pragmatic argument against gun control is simply that it doesn't  
work. Indeed, it seems to encourage crime to the extent that the  
criminally inclined are emboldened by the powerlessness of potential  
victims. But there is an even stronger moral argument, which will be  
heard more and more frequently as Americans in increasing numbers  
express their disenchantment with dependency and seek to reestablish  
their self-respect.  <p>
  
It is the argument of a brave people whose descendants very nearly  
succumbed to cowardice. As incorporated into the Declaration of  
Independence. it expresses the once self-evident truths that all people   
have the right to live, to be free, and to act in their own best interests; that  
these fights are given to us by God. not by other men; that governments  
have no other purpose than to protect these rights; and that a people can  
at any time discharge a government whose protection has burgeoned into  
oppression.  <p>
  
The possession of rights presupposes not only the responsibility for their  
proper use, but also the power to preserve them. Given the obvious  
inability of government to protect the rights of all people at all times, and   
the obvious inability of an unarmed citizenry to protect itself against a  
government that enjoys a monopoly on the use of force, it is abundantly  
clear that a free people must be armed to remain free. Americans are   
beginning to understand again that independence is a right, and bravery  
the virtue that preserves it. It's a good thing, too, because America will  
remain the land of the free only as long as it is also the home of the   
brave.  <p>

<h2>Americorps: Voluntarism?</h2> <br></center>
 
When Congress tried to defund Americorps last year, Democrats accused  
Republicans of wanting to destroy "voluntarism." But what kind of  
voluntarism is it when the volunteer gets paid, and handsomely?  <p>
  
  
High school graduates who defer college for a year and enroll in  
Americorps instead "receive a healthy stipend and a $4,700 voucher for  
college education," reports Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute   
for the Study of Religion and Liberty, in a recent newspaper editorial. He  
cites an audit by the General Accounting Office that pegged the cost of  
the 20,000 Americorps "volunteers" at nearly $31.500 each, "which  
works out to be pretty good pay at taxpayers' expense."  <p>
  
Sirico suggests that "voluntarism" may not be the right word for such  
activity. "One view of voluntarism is that it is uncompensated labor," he  
observes. "People volunteer at a soup kitchen or in local service clubs.   
Well, by that definition, Americorps is not voluntary. Eliminate the  
incentives of the stipend and the education voucher and then we'll  
discover just how 'voluntary' the program is." <p> 
  
Sirico is willing to consider other definitions. He notes that voluntarism  
may be construed to mean "doing something because of benevolent  
personal desire," and concedes that Americorps workers may be   
motivated by good intentions. "But this does not set them apart from  
other workers." he insists. "Most entrepreneurs love their work. They also  
desire the happiness of others. They try to give people something they  
want, whether it is a good meal, quality clothing, sturdy housing, or  
reliable letter delivery. Somehow, though, capitalist acts are not supposed  
to qualify as 'voluntary' in this sense."  <p>
  
Suppose "voluntarism" simply means "anything that is not coerced." Still,  
we have a problem. "In a market economy, the jobs of just about  
everyone pass this test. No one is forced to take a job," says Sirico. "Most   
people face an array of alternatives of how to use their talents in the  
market." Sirico insists that "the very existence of our social safety net  
means workers in America volunteer to be responsible people, to earn a   
living by the sweat of their brows."  <p>
  
No, none of these definitions will do. "The only trait of Americorps that  
distinguishes it from charity, jobs, or entrepreneurship in the private  
sector," Sirico concludes, "is that it is sponsored and run by government.   
This seems to be the message of Americorps: You're not really working  
for the social good unless you are working under government guidance."  
Sirico finds this message disturbing. "It teaches young people a false  
notion about trade," he says, the notion being that "working for a  
business, for profit. is somehow ignoble." Americorps "forcibly siphons  
money from the public through taxation" and pays its volunteers "a   
hefty sum" while vaunting its moral superiority. <p> 
  
Sirico has some sage advice for the idealistic youth: "If serving others is  
what you desire, don't be bought off by a government program. Try  
something voluntary that is personally challenging, socially beneficial,   
and doesn't cost the taxpayers one dime."  <p>

<h2>Social Experimentation in Americas Armed Forces</h2> </center>
 
Here is a revolting irony for you: Daring young combat pilots feel more 
secure dodging anti-aircraft guns over enemy territory than they do when 
speaking their minds on American soil. <p>
 
 
The temperature can reach 125 degrees on the tarmac at Nellis Air Force 
Base in Nevada, reports Mindy Belz in a recent issue of World magazine. 
"Hotter still," she says, "is the situation of any officer who dares  
to question even in a private conversation, the Clinton administration's 
policies that are undermining the spirit of America's armed forces." Belz 
observes with dismay that the officers at the Air Force Weapons School 
"speak cautiously. even mechanically, about profound changes in the 
military" -- voicing pat approval for such controversial trends as women 
in combat, downsizing of the services, and murky missions under foreign 
command. When the men charged with defending our freedoms have to 
watch everything they say and be constantly on guard against betrayal, 
something is desperately wrong in America. <p>
 
It is true that soldiers must be trained not to question authority. "The 
militarys code of ethics -- taking orders -at its best preserves order and 
strength in the military," Belz concedes. "But the about-face of President 
Clinton (and President Bush before him) on fundamental issues -- such as 
keeping military policy insulated from the fluctuating pop-culture 
influences -- has trickled down without public debate." This is an  
unhealthy situation. It will lead to demoralization of the troops, their 
involvement in social experimentation. and reduced security for our 
country. "Stifling debate on matters that go to the heart of military 
readiness undermines the dutiful," Belz charges. "Political correctness 
turns loyalty into Newspeak." <p>
 
Orders may be orders, but every veteran can remember when giving and 
getting some guff was part of the equation. After all, the right to have his 
own opinion, the right to disagree, was partly what he fought for. Blind 
obedience went out with the Nuremberg trials. Or did it? Belz cites the 
case of Navy Lt. Commander Ken Carkhuff, a 17-year veteran who 
confided to his commanding officer that he had religious objections  
to women in combat. That comment led ultimately to a board of inquiry, 
which recommended separation from the service. Fortunately, public 
opinion persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to overrule the board and  
allow Carkhuff to remain. A high-ranking Air Force officer who prefers 
to remain nameless says that criticizing the concept of women in combat 
is "a career-ender." <p>
 
Belz points out that "the Senate continues to hold the power of conferring 
rank on all military officers,'' and that feminist senators "have attacked 
the retirement grade of three Navy admirals . . . who were accused of  
not promoting women." This is America? Men who spent their entire 
lives in service must now kowtow to these feminist bullies or risk 
jeopardizing the benefits they have earned. Can this be the country they  
fought for? <p>

<h2>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty </h2></center>
 
The Clinton Administration claims to have abandoned the doctrine of  
Mutual Assured Destruction, but its interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic  
Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union says otherwise. <p> 
  
  
"The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic  
missile defense," say Kim Holmes and Baker Spring of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Whether to proceed more quickly or more slowly to deploy  
missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is  
determined by how the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions  
underlying the treaty. forged during the Cold War, are very much alive in  
the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administrations approach not  
only to missile defense policy, but also to arms control and even U.S.  
policy toward Russia," Holmes and Baker charge.  <p>
  
The two defense analysts argue that the Clinton Administration's  
interpretation of the ABM Treaty is perpetuating America's vulnerability  
to ballistic missile attack. That interpretation reflects a willingness "to   
defend U.S. allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and  
territory vulnerable to nuclear attack." Holmes and Baker contend that the  
Administration is "expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit  
theater missile defenses, even though this was never intended b! the  
original architects of the Treaty."  <p>
  
The Clinton Administration calls the ABM Treaty "a cornerstone of  
strategic stability," but disavows the doctrine of Mutual Assured  
Destruction that underlies it. Holmes and Baker point out that "the basic   
assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet  
Union . . . and the United States to destroy each other was the central  
factor in maintaining strategic stability. The ABM Treaty," they say,   
"was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued." But, if Mutual  
Assured Destruction "is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine,  
then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of strategic  
stability."  <p>
  
The Treaty is not much of an incentive for arms control either. A strong  
U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive  
reductions than the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be," say Holmes   
and Baker. "During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions  
occurred only after the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic  
Defense Initiative would proceed." Noting that "no major arms control  
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton  
Administration. which has scaled back America's missile defense  
programs," the two analysts conclude that "the Russians are quicker to   
reach arms control agreements with the U.S when they face a determined  
U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak one."  <p>
  
The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction should be scrapped once and  
for all, say Holmes and Baker, and replaced with a policy that "seeks to  
prevent potentially hostile forces from obtaining missiles and weapons of  
mass destruction," deters the possessors of such weapons from using  
them, defends against missile attacks once they have begun, and allows  
for preemptive strikes against missile delivery systems.  <p>

<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<h2>Educators Attack Family Values  </h2></center>
 
An education expert says that "challenges from conservative citizen  
groups objecting to particular instructional strategies and materials" are  
hampering efforts "to make fundamental changes in public schooling "  <p>
  
  
Writing in the September 1993 issue of Phi Delta Kappan, Indiana  
University professor of education Martha McCarthy tipped off her  
colleagues to a new trend in parental protests against teaching materials.   
"Until the late 1970s the targets were usually individual books," she  
observed. "While the list of individual books under attack continues to  
grow. recent protests -- often orchestrated by national conservative  
groups -- are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and  
components of the instructional program." <p> 
  
That means that pet theories and vested interests are at stake. Take, for  
instance the Whole Language approach to reading. McCarthy noted that  
"the most widely challenged textbook series" at that time was Harcourt  
Brace Jovanovich's 10-volume anthology Impressions, which uses the  
Whole language method. "Most of the challenges focus on the series'  
subject matter rather than on its pedagogical approach," she conceded.  
"but the controversy associated with Impressions may have implications  
for the future of Whole-Language instruction."  <p>
  
McCarthy reported that conservatives have also attacked the Quest  
curriculum for teaching relativism and disrespect for parental authority,  
the Tactics for Thinking program for teaching New Age beliefs, and   
Outcome Based Education for teaching hardly anything. She noted that  
"instruction pertaining to values clarification, self-esteem, multicultural  
education, evolution, AIDS education, and global education are being  
contested as anti-Christian, anti-American, or other vise inappropriate."  
But the meddling doesn't stop there, McCarthy continued. "Several  
instructional strategies currently touted in the education literature, such as  
collaborative learning and thematic instruction, are being challenged  
because they shift to students some of the responsibility that was formerly  
lodged with the teacher."<p>  
  
Such challenges, McCarthy warned her peers, "call into question some of  
the basic assumptions of school restructuring initiatives," thereby posing  
"far more serious threats to efforts to improve the public school program  
than do challenges to individual novels." What's more, she added, "the  
success rate of those initiating challenges has been rising." Even  
unsuccessful challenges sometimes delay construction of educational  
utopias, "for the controversy itself can disrupt school operations and  
interfere with implementation of the program." Then there's the dreaded  
ripple effect: "When materials or programs are attacked in one school  
district, the controversy often affects other districts."  <p>
  
In a fit of candor, McCarthy advised her colleagues to drop their pretense  
of impartiality and give up trying to appease parents. "Instead of arguing  
that the challenged instructional programs are value-neutral or trying to  
sanitize the curriculum so that no groups are offended, policymakers and  
educators need to take a stand," exhorted McCarthy. She thus confirmed  
what many conservative parents have suspected all along: that educators  
are fighting an undeclared war against families with traditional values.  
We should thank Martha McCarthy for letting parents know what they're  
up against.  <p>

<title>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations</h2></center><p>

Health maintenance organizations (called HMOs) are growing rapidly. 
And so is the evidence that the managed care they provide is not all it's 
cracked up to be! <p>

According to the September issue of Consumers' Research, "the main 
difficulty with HMOs is the financial arrangement made with doctors." 
That arrangement may include "a fixed amount of money per covered 
patient," as well as "bonuses for delivering care on a frugal basis." Such 
incentives "reward physicians for deferring or withholding care that is 
seen as being too expensive -- in essence pitting the financial interest of 
the doctor against the medical interest of the patient."<p>

Consumers' Research reports that, with HMOs, "the less your doctor 
does for you. the more money he gets to keep." That means that HMOs 
have built-in incentives "against referring you to a specialist authorizing a high-tech procedure. or approving a costly operation. In some HMOs. there may be a review board empowered to deny you such treatment even when your doctor says you need it."<p>

Consumers' Research offers a sampling of "the mounting number of 
press accounts and official studies" indicating that, once you join an 
HMO, "you may receive inadequate care. or be denied some procedure 
that could improve your health or even save your life." A Washington 
Post story from August of last year reports that some doctors believe the 
managed care system "changes the way physicians think about patients 
for the worse and may encourage them to shun patients with high risks or 
expensive health problems." This past August, the Washington Post 
reported on the situation at a San Francisco medical center, where "organ 
transplant specialists have turned down patients who might have been 
given transplants in the past even though they had poor prospects for 
recovery." Without transplants, of course, such patients are doomed.<p>

Last November American Medical News reported the comments of an 
emergency physician in Sacramento regarding "dangerous interference by 
managed care plans" lobbying the state legislature to restrict the scope of 
their coverage. He cited the case of a patient with a possible spine 
fracture whose plan denied authorization for care, and a patient with "an 
externalizing arterial hemorrhage" who was ushered out of an emergency 
room and sent off to a plan physician's office. "There has been a great 
deal of gatekeeper misbehavior and failure to understand emergency 
medical procedures," said the doctor. "That puts patients in a position of 
choosing between their lives and their pocketbooks, even though they are 
insured and these services should be covered."<p>

According to the July 9th New York Times, "hospitals across the country 
report that HMOs are increasingly denying claims for care provided in 
hospital emergency rooms." Early this year, the Department of Health 
and Human Services revealed that up to 25 percent of former HMO 
participants surveyed "said they failed to receive primary care, referrals 
to specialists, and HMO coverage of emergency care they believed they 
needed." The Department found that "chronically ill and disabled 
patients" have expressed "an alarmingly high level of dissatisfaction with 
the care provided by HMOs."<p>

<title>ABM Treaty -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>

<h2>ABM Treaty</h2></center>

It looks as if our representatives in Washington may finally summon the 
courage to withdraw from the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and 
renounce the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction that jeopardizes our 
nation's safety.<p>

In June the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected an 
amendment to a defense appropriations bill that would have endorsed 
continued adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The 
amendment's defeat could foreshadow an end to the insane policy of 
Mutual Assured Destruction, which many people call the MAD doctrine. 
This vote of 221 Republicans and 21 Democrats "suggests that there is, at 
long last. a growing -- and bipartisan -- appreciation that America's 
present vulnerability to ballistic missile attack is as reckless as it is 
absurd." says Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security 
Policy. "The tally also admirably reflected the House leadership's 
determination to correct this grievous deficiency."<p>

During an appearance on the Sunday morning TV show "This Week With 
David Brinkley," a few days before the vote. House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich argued that the United States should "proceed with defending 
itself against ballistic missiles from countries like Iran, North Korea or 
Syria or Libya." Noting that an anti-ballistic missile system could be 
functional "within two or three years . . . for a very low cost," Gingrich 
declared his strong support for "setting aside the ABM Treaty" so that the 
United States can defend itself.<p>

Some said that this House vote was "tantamount to a repudiation of the 
ABM Treaty." That's an exaggeration, but. according to Frank Gaffney, 
it's a good start. It shows that advocating abrogation of the ABM treaty is 
"no longer politically taboo." Gaffney predicts that "the new taboo will be 
the idea of perpetuating the American people's vulnerability to ballistic 
missile attack."<p>

Frank Gaffney explains the vote like this: "First, the public is largely 
unaware that it is unprotected against missile strikes," or that the ABM 
Treaty requires that our country remain defenseless. "When acquainted 
with that reality, [Americans] overwhelmingly favor putting [U.S.] 
defenses into place," Gaffney observes. "Second, notice was served on 
those legislators who persist in voting against providing such protection 
[that they] will be held responsible for voting to perpetuate U.S. 
vulnerability."<p>

The diehard supporters of the obsolete ABM Treaty were reduced to 
denying the threat of ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations, or 
insisting that maintaining a treaty with Russia is somehow more 
important than protecting ourselves against attacks from other quarters. 
Such arguments are clearly untenable. "The truth of the matter, of course, 
is that there is a growing threat -- both from indigenously developed 
[missile] systems and from those that can be bought on the world 
market," says Gaffney, noting that there are roughly 25 countries 
currently "working to acquire ballistic missiles and the chemical, 
biological and/or nuclear weapons they might carry." The old model of 
two superpowers facing each other no longer reflects the world we live 
in. The 1972 ABM Treaty cannot protect us from rogue nations that 
commit terrorist acts and now have the capability of nuclear mischief.<p>

<title>Pollution Control -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>Pollution Control</h2></center>

Wouldn't it be great if driving a car made the air cleaner instead of  
dirtier? That may seem like a crackpot idea, but someone's already 
developed the technology to make this paradoxical pipedream a 
revolutionary reality.<p>

In a recent column in the Washington Times, Eric Peters sings the praises 
of realistic pollution-control technologies that "would allow Americans to 
continue their love affair with the automobile -- without despoiling the 
planet." Particularly promising is the aptly-named "smog-eating radiator," 
developed by Ford Motor Company and the Engelhard Corporation. 
Peters explains that this intriguing new device "features a special catalyst coating that treats all the outside air that flows through it. [acting] much like an air filter -- only on a much larger scale.". This revolutionary new radiator appears to be able to "destroy 90 percent of the ground level ozone in ambient air that passes through it."<p>

Putting all that in layman's terms, Peters says that "'dirty' air passing 
through the radiator comes out the other side virtually 'clean.' Thus, the 
mere act of driving your car could actually clean up the air we breathe -- 
instead of making things worse than they are." The radiator does the 
cleaning all by itself. Nothing else is needed, says Peters, "and the 
technology can be applied to any vehicle on the road, regardless of age. 
Indeed,  it would be theoretically possible to retrofit most of the cars 
currently in service for a fairly modest amount of money, and with no 
adverse impact on vehicle function or performance."<p>

Peters observes that "one of the biggest obstacles to improving air quality 
is the 'lag time' between the introduction of a new emissions control 
technology" and its widespread usage. The simplicity of the smog-eating 
radiator should greatly accelerate the turnaround time. "Instead of the 
usual 10 or more years it takes for something like engine computers or 
fuel injection to become commonplace -- and therefore have a 
meaningful impact on air quality -- the smog-eating radiator could be put 
into widespread service in a fraction of that time."<p>

Studies indicate that smog-eating radiators have the potential to reduce 
air pollution more effectively than either alternative fuels or coercive 
carpooling. One such study. Peters reports, "estimates that if 9 million 
vehicles traveling 266 million miles per day in Los Angeles were 
equipped with smog-eating radiators, the air flowing through these 
radiators -- and being purified of harmful ozone and carbon monoxide 
along the way -- would be equivalent to all the air across the entire Los 
Angeles area up to a height of about 15 feet."<p>

There's a lesson to be learned from all this. "This technology is a terrific example of the innovation that is possible if society gives industry the chance to work on the best solutions for our air pollution problems," says Lou Ross of the Ford Motor Company. "You can't predict where invention is going to come from -- and you certainly can't mandate it into existence."<p>

<h2>People for the American Way</h2></center>

People for the American Way is pulling out all the stops in its fight 
against the so-called Religious Right. That's because the radical left 
knows the tide is turning against them.<p>

The Capital Research Center describes People for the American Way, the 
tax-exempt organization founded in 1980 by television producer Norman 
Lear, as "the largest and most influential group seeking to counter the 
Religious Right in America." PAW's donors include big names in the 
entertainment industry, the National Education Association and several 
other unions, and numerous tax-exempt foundations.<p>

The group's avowed objectives are to uphold church and state separation, 
maintain prohibitions against school prayer, and provide "technical and 
legal assistance" to combat "censorship" of school books. "During the 
1992-93 school year, PAW says it documented 347 cases in which a 
parent, school official, or church group demanded that library [books] or 
textbooks be removed or restricted -- up from 229 cases the year before." 
According to PAW, "religious conservatives or members of organizations 
described as 'Far Right' . . . were involved in 90 percent of the cases and 
were believed to have inspired another 18 percent."<p>

A PAW report on the conservative impact on school boards during the 
1992-93 school year documents "the emergence of a grassroots 
revolution that threatens to undermine an already challenged American 
public education system." PAW alleges that the Right "is now in the 
initial stages of a community-by-community battle to gain control over 
school boards through the ballot box."<p>

People for the American Way thinks that the exercise by parents of their 
democratic prerogative is truly sinister! PAW argues that it is unfair for 
candidates of the Religious Right to win elections without revealing 
"their full agenda for the schools." PAW ignores the fact that such 
"stealth tactics" were the very means liberals used to establish their 
current hegemony. PAW warns that the so-called, Religious Right is no 
longer confined to the "Bible belt," noting that in 1993 "Religious Right 
candidates won school board elections in at least 12 states." According to 
PAW's count, roughly a third of the 243 candidates it identified as 
belonging to the Religious Right "won primaries or general election 
campaigns" in 1993.<p>

For years now education officials have acted as "change agents," 
insinuating into the public school system policies and curricula offensive 
to parents with traditional values. Gradually, the hidden objectives are 
becoming known, and parents are fighting back. The education 
establishment grows increasingly hostile as it tries to protect its control 
over children's minds. The attacks against the Religious Right, 
orchestrated by People for the American Way, are going to get shriller. 
But the shriller they get, the more cause there is for optimism; for that 
shrillness is a reflection of the insecurity felt by members of a public 
school monopoly facing exposure. They know that the secret victories 
they have achieved over the past several decades will not withstand an 
open battle.<p>

Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art? Television's new fall lineup may hold the answer.<p>

The question -- whether art imitates life, or vice versa -- can be applied 
fruitfully to television, if one assumes a loose interpretation of the word 
art, which, of course, is the interpretation in vogue. The "situations" in 
some television programs do reflect an existing reality, while others 
clearly serve as models for imitation. Most, however, fall somewhere in 
between mere re-creation and outright advocacy. The single-parent TV 
family, for instance may now reflect an unfortunate demographic trend, 
but it's been a television standby for years. Perhaps the phenomenon 
began as a matter of plot convenience, or as a cheap trick for winning 
instant sympathy for the main character. Whatever the case, on TV at 
least, the broken home has proven to be more enduring than the 
traditional American family as memorialized in Leave It to Beaver. Ozzie 
and Harriet, and The Dick Van Dyke shows. Nowadays, only minority 
families are allowed to remain intact on television.<p>

Which comes first, the broadcast broken home or the real-life broken 
home? It's hard to say. Nevertheless, the number of broken homes on TV 
is disproportionately high and constitutes a distortion of reality. Single-
parent TV families naturally lend themselves to grief mongering. What in 
public schools today goes by the name of "Death Education" has wormed 
its way into prime-time programming. Those single-parent TV families 
that have not resulted from divorce presuppose the death of one of the 
spouses. Such programs encourage the immature viewer to contemplate 
the prospect of his own parents' estrangement from each other, as well as 
the even grimmer possibility of their untimely deaths.<p>

Casual sexual practices are also more prevalent on the air than off. and 
gratuitous displays of flesh and simulated carnality are on the rise, 
especially in "dramatic" serials. Raunchiness and the rapidly changing 
multiple-plot format often go hand in hand, for they both pander to the 
demand for immediate gratification. The mature, loving relationship and 
the sophisticated, sustained plot require a keener insight into human 
nature and a greater attention span than are commonly possessed by 
people who respond to mental images with their sweat and salivary 
glands. With their incessant jumping from one swiftly developing plot to 
another. and the endless permutations of "relationships," the nighttime 
soaps are custom-made for the impatient hedonist.<p>

As with each new television season, there are one or two bright spots on 
the video horizon. Most of the new shows, of course, will fail to generate 
any significant interest among jaded television viewers, and some will set 
new standards for the stinker. A rare few will carve out audiences 
sufficient to perpetuate their existence. Still, we'd all be better off if the new fall lineup were completely disappointing. Then maybe we'd find the 
time, and the energy, to read a book, dine out with our spouses, play 
games with the kids, or visit the neighbors.<p>

<h2>Environmental Protection</h2></center>

The federal government has undermined private property rights in the 
name of environmental protection, but it's becoming increasingly clear 
that protecting the environment and protecting the rights of landowners 
go hand in hand.<p>

"The growth of federal land-use regulation over the past two decades has 
sparked a firestorm of grassroots opposition," says Jonathan Adler of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Landowners around the country are 
upset with their government for denying them the reasonable use of their 
land in the name of protecting endangered species. maintaining 'wild and 
scenic' rivers, preserving wetlands. and establishing national parks." 
Adler says there is "broad public support for current environmental laws." 
but there is also "strong public sentiment in favor of compensation for 
regulatory takings." In other words. Americans believe in protecting the 
environment against despoliation, but they also believe in protecting the 
landowner against expropriation. Americans believe that landowners 
should be reimbursed for any losses caused by environmental regulations.<p>

Although "literally dozens of federal statutes and programs restrict the 
nonharmful use of private property." federal laws all by themselves 
account for "the lion's share of regulatory takings," says Adler, citing the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as the 
major culprits. Seventy-five percent of threatened species "rely upon 
private land for some or all of their habitat." and most officially 
designated wetlands are held privately. "Thus, as long as the federal 
government continues to rely upon regulation to conserve these 
resources, widespread conflicts with private landowners are inevitable."<p>

"The proper aim of federal government efforts to protect 'the 
environment' is to prevent the imposition of harmful substances upon 
unconsenting persons and their properties; and. failing that. punishing 
those who transgress against others in this manner," Adler contends. 
"Pollution is a 'trespass' or 'nuisance' under the principles of common law. Environmental statutes should not supersede common law protections, as 
most have. but rather reinforce them."<p>

Adler points out that "'public goods' such as military bases and highways 
are created by purchasing lands from private owners. On the other hand, 
'public goods' like wetland preserves and wildlife refuges are created by 
bureaucratic edicts that deny property owners the use of their land. This 
is not how it should be." Adler insists. "If the public wants to protect the habitat of an endangered species or preserve an ancient stand of trees for some aesthetic, spiritual, or broad 'environmental' value, then the public should be willing to pay for it, just as it pays for other 'public goods."' The current landowner should not be expected to absorb the loss.<p>

Adler maintains that property rights are "important for both economic 
and environmental reasons, and must be protected from both government 
regulation and private malfeasance. Compensating landowners when they 
are deprived of the reasonable use of their land will not produce 
environmental catastrophe. Far from it. In many cases, it will eliminate 
the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of 
existing government regulations."<p>

<title>U.S. Postal Service -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>U.S. Postal Service</h2></center>

One out of five first-class letters entrusted to the United States Postal 
Service arrives late. Nearly a fourth of the Postal Service 's two-day 
Priority Mail takes at least three days to get where it's going The zip code is now four digits longer, but the postal service is showing less and less zip.<p>

"The Postal Service has a well-earned reputation for slow delivery," says 
Gregory Conko of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. More than a 
century of monopoly status has made the Postal Service "complacent and 
slothful," Conko contends. "An over-bureaucratized management and a 
powerfully unionized workforce have resisted improvement and turned 
mediocrity into a perverted trademark."

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the ostensibly independent 
Postal Service "broad authority to improve management capability, 
modernize antiquated facilities. and allow postal rates to keep pace with 
cost increases." says Conko. "Tragically, the original goal of improving 
the quality and scope of service, while achieving financial self-
sufficiency over a period of years, has never been realized." The extent of 
the Postal Service's failure is reflected in the size of the debt it owes to the U.S. Treasury -- a whopping $9 billion.<p>

Despite its lack of success, the Postal Service has its defenders. They 
argue that "private, commercial rivals -such as Federal Express, United 
Parcel Service, and more than 300 other alternate delivery firms -- are 
willing to compete with the Post Office only for expensive overnight 
service. but have no interest in delivering the lower-priced items.'> 
Conko calls this a "disingenuous argument." since the Postal Service 
enjoys a "legal monopoly on first-class mail." If that monopoly is more of 
a burden than a benefit, as this line of reasoning seems to suggest, then 
there shouldn't be any objection to repealing the monopoly. Once the 
first-class field is open to all comers, it will soon be obvious whether 
anyone wants to compete or not.<p>

"Supporters also argue that private firms wouldn't deliver first-class mail 
to ever home in the country as cheaply as the Postal Service," says 
Conko, but this too is a bogus argument. since the Post Office has never 
delivered to every home nationwide. "There are many areas in the United 
States where the Postal Service will only deliver mail to Post Office 
Boxes," notes Conko. "In some western states, farmers have to travel as 
far as 40 miles to pick up their mail. But private delivery companies often 
target rural areas for service. The Postal Service even contracts out much 
of its rural delivery . . . to private firms." Conko points out that "private competition for first-class mail delivery was alive and well (as well as legal) in the 19th century." Delivery services like the famed Pony Express "offered stiff competition to the government's Post Office, providing better. more timely service and charging lower rates."<p>

Conko applauds congressional proposals to privatize the Postal Service. 
but insists that "the most important aspect of reform remains rescinding 
the postal monopoly.... Real privatization can come later," he argues, "but 
competition is the key to improvement."<p>

<title>Social Security Pandering -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>Social Security Pandering</h2></center>

Politicians pander to senior citizens when they say that Social Security is 
sacrosanct. Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution warns of what will 
happen when the baby boomers are drawing benefits instead of paying 
taxes.<p>

"Even the most gung-ho budgetcutters in Washington make it a point to 
say that Social Security is off-limits," says syndicated columnist Thomas 
Sowell of the Hoover Institution, who concedes that to say otherwise is 
considered tantamount to political suicide. While acknowledging that 
Social Security recipients would be "outraged and up in arms if the 
federal government reneged on its promises and pulled the rug out from 
under them.'' Sowell insists that drastic steps must be taken to avert an 
impending disaster.<p>

Even if we are obliged to honor expensive promises made in the past, 
"we can at least stop making the same promises for the future." says 
Sowell. "Assure all those currently receiving Social Security checks that 
they will not lose one red cent." he urges. "Give the same assurances to 
those within a decade of their eligibility for Social Security. But there is no reason to continue subsidizing everyone who reaches a certain age." 
says Sowell. "If there are elderly people who are needy. Let them be 
subsidized out of general revenues, from which a transitional phaseout of 
Social Security could also be financed."<p>

Sowell explodes several of the enduring myths about Social Security. 
One myth is the notion that social security payments are qualitatively 
different from welfare relief. "As for the argument that people who have 
put contributions in are not welfare recipients when they take money 
out," says Sowell, "that of course depends on how much they put in and 
how much they take out." Most social security recipients extract far more 
from the system than they contributed.<p>

The fact "that Social Security is currently running a surplus and, that its 
reserve is expected to reach $3 trillion by the year 2020" serves as the 
basis of another myth. the myth of the system's solvency. "All of us can 
run a surplus," says Sowell, "if we are allowed to count all our assets and 
ignore enough of our liabilities," Sowell concedes that "$3 trillion is 
certainly a lot of money -- but not if you owe $4 trillion."<p>

Even the I in FICA, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, represents 
"pure fraud," says Sowell. "The word 'insurance' serves the political 
purpose of removing the onus of its being a handout like welfare or other 
entitlement programs. But a genuine insurance system collects money 
and invests it in assets which cover its liabilities. The Social Security 
system's assets have never covered its liabilities. It is not insurance." 
Sowell insists, "but a pyramid scheme in which those who enrolled earlier 
get what is paid in by those who enroll later."<p>

Sowell says the scheme "worked like a charm as long as the pyramid kept 
expanding, with the baby boomers' contributions being used to support 
the smaller generation before it." But, when the baby boomers reach age 
65, there will not be enough taxpayers to support social security as we 
know it.<p>

<title>Central Intelligence Agency -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>Central Intelligence Agency</h2></center>

The major media chastised the CIA for taking so long to ferret out Soviet 
mole Aldrich Ames. But the media itself may be partly to blame for 
undermining the Agency's ability to protect itself:<p>

"The announcement of the arrest of Aldrich Ames early last year. and the 
details of his horrific work as a Soviet mole inside the CIA for nine years, touched off a firestorm of attacks on the CIA itself," says James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom, and a former OSS officer. Tyson says the major media criticized the CIA for its 
"negligence" in allowing Ames's dirtv work to go undetected for so long, 
attributing that negligence to the reluctance of the agency's "Old Boy 
Network" to suspect one of its own. At least four major books have been 
rushed into print to add fuel to the fire.<p>

"What has not been recognized," Tvson charges, "is that the media and 
some of the book authors are themselves greatly responsible for the 
weakness in the CIA's counterintelligence operations. which allowed 
Ames to operate freely." According to Tyson. it was "the media vendetta 
on the CIA and its counterintelligence that led to ag,itation in Congress 
and successive presidential administrations. resulting in the firing of the 
counterintelligence head. James J. Angleton, and a virtual dismantling of 
the CIA's counterintelligence staff. This in turn caused the Agency to be 
vulnerable to the operations of a Sos iet mole like Aldrich Ames."<p>

Undermining the counterintelligence capability of the CIA was a major 
communist objective. says Tyson. "In the 1 960s and '70s, the Soviet 
Union under Khrushchev and his successors mounted a massive 
propaganda campaign against the CIA, much more effective than the 
clumsy efforts of the Stalin regime. The Soviets," Tyson reminds us, 
"regarded the CIA as a major threat. the eyes and ears of their main 
enemv. the United States. In the '70s, the campaign reached a climax with 
increasingly strident attacks by ultra-liberals." CIA critics jumping on the bashers bandwagon included "communist front groups like the National 
Lawers Guild and farleft Soviet sympathizers like the Institute for 
Policy Studies." <p>

Tyson recalls that President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby 
made "many well-meaning but naive attempts to cooperate with reform 
efforts." Colby eventually fired counterintelligence chief Jarnes Angleton 
and many of his top aides. and was himself later fired by Ford. 
"Angleton's competence and reputed paranoia about moles is still a matter 
of disagreement among experts," concedes Tyson. "but there is no doubt 
that, after firing him.Colby and his successors went too far in virtually 
dismantling the counterintelligence capability."<p>

Under President Carter, hundreds of counterintelligence agents were let 
go. Eventually, the top echelon in the Agency began to emphasize 
technical means of acquiring intelligence. such as satellite photographs, 
in preference to traditional espionage. Tyson says "the main lesson of the 
Ames disaster is not the need to reform the CIA's 'Old Boy Network' and 
out-of-date procedures, but to restore its capacity for human 
intelligencegathering, especially in the counterintelligence area."<p>

<h2>J. Edgar Hoover</h2></center>

The reputation of J. Edgar Hoover has been greatly tarnished in the 23 
years since his death, but two new books about the longtime FBI director 
have set the record straight at last.<p>

Smearing the character of J. Edgar Hoover has been a popular pastime for 
two decades, but it's time now to put his ugly business behind us. Former 
FBI agent Ray Wannall says two new books offer a fresh. objective 
appraisal of the man who single-handedly transformed the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation "from a dumping ground for political hacks, ex-
convicts, and alcoholics into a world-renowned law-enforcement 
agency."<p>

Wannall says William Breuer's J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men is an 
engrossing. exhaustively researched book that captures "Hoover's 
mystique and the sheer force of his will." Breuer himself declares that 
one of his motives for writing the book was to "counter the barrage of 
vilification and garbage that has been heaped on this great American." 
Just 99  years old when he was appointed FBI Director in 1924. Hoover 
quickly established a reputation as a disciplinarian, rooting out the rabble among his investigative staff and replacing them with skilled lawyers and accountants -- all subjected to rigorous background checks and intensive training courses, and thereafter held to a strict code of conduct. One high-level FBI man recalls that Hoover "had standards of perfection and he expected everybody in the Bureau to live up to them."<p>

With his awesome leadership and managerial ability, Hoover led the FBI 
in a successful assault on the notorious (Gangsters of the Prohibition and 
Depression eras. Ma Barker, John Dillinger, "Pretty Boy" Floyd, 
"Machine Gun" Kelly, "Baby Face" Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde are 
just a few of the public enemies Hoover brought to justice. In 1936. 
President Franklin Roosevelt directed Hoover to develop intelligence 
regarding subversive activities by communists, fascists, and other anti-
American groups. Hoover's success in this mission explains the ferocity 
of the subsequent attacks on his character.<p>

Ray Wannall also recommends a book written by Cartha D. DeLoach, the 
Number Three man in the FBI. behind Hoover and his associate director. 
Wannall says Hoover's FBI: The Inside Story by Hoover's Trusted 
Lieutenant "shows the full spectrum of Hoover's character and 
personality and is laced with Hoover's humor and amusing incidents 
involving prominent people, members of Congress. and White House 
personnel." The book. Wannall insists, presents "an unbiased portrait of 
the man, warts and all. by one who knew him, worked closely with-him, 
put up with his idiosyncrasies, and admired him even to the point of 
declining to take over his job when it was offered to him."<p>

DeLoach acknowledges in his book that Hoover was "proud and vain . . . 
and not above abusing his power. He could be petty and vindictive. He 
stayed in office too long, and, in so doing, he helped damage the 
reputation of the FBI he had virtually invented and perfected." Hoover 
may not have known when to quit, but the accomplishments he achieved 
in his prime cannot be denied. He was a true patriot, and he deserves an 
honored place in American history.<p>

<title>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million</h2></center>
<P>

United Nations ambassadors and their embassies owe U.S. banks,  
landlords, and merchants more than $9 million, and some have been  
delinquent on their debts for more than two years! 
       <P>
"The problem of diplomatic indebtedness is a matter of significant  
concern," admits UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "Non- 
payment of just debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community  
and tarnishes the image of the United Nations itself." As much as it may  
worry the Secretary-General, the tarnished image of the UN is the least of  
concerns for the unfortunate New York City businesses left holding the  
bag. And some observers would argue that the UN's image isn't nearly as  
tarnished as it deserves to be. 
                     <P>
The debt of the deadbeat diplomats stood at roughly $1 million in 1990,  
but the UN's head-in-the-sand reaction allowed it to multiply by a factor  
of nine in just five years. Moreover, it was only at the insistence of the  
U.S. mission and the City of New York that the debt was made public at  
all. The names of the offending diplomats, however, remained secret. A  
vote by the U.S. Senate at the end of July, withholding $10 million from  
the UN until the names of the diplomats are disclosed, may loosen some  
lips. 
                         <P>
About 80 percent of the $9 million debt is owed to banks and landlords,  
the rest to merchants. According to Boutros-Ghali, 31 missions have  
contributed to the debt, but five alone account for 83 percent of it. Those  
five are rumored to be the African nations of Sierra Leone, Congo, Zaire,  
Liberia, and the Central African Republic. 
                             <P>
"Some missions had not paid rent for two years or more," reports  
Boutros-Ghali. "And a number of residential landlords had either lost  
their property or were at risk of losing it because diplomatic tenants. who  
could not be evicted, would neither pay their rent nor leave the property." 
                                       <P>
New Yorkers don't like getting stiffed, and they're becoming increasingly  
reluctant to offer their goods and services to foreign legates. The billion  
dollars of revenue that the UN supposedly generates for the city each year  
is offset by the cost of services the city must provide, and by the  
aggravation caused by diplomats who flout local laws and abuse their  
privilege of immunity. Americans outside of New York derive no  
economic benefit whatsoever from the UN, but the price we pay as  
taxpayers is substantial, given the status of the United States as the UN's  
largest contributor. The real cost of the UN, however, must be reckoned  
in liberties and lives lost.  
              <P>
Next Wednesday marks the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the  
United Nations Charter by the United States Senate on October 25, 1945.  
For the next two weeks, while the major media trumpet the dubious  
achievements of this would-be world government, we'll be reporting  
Behind The Headlines on the myriad ways in which the United Nations  
undermines the sovereignty of our country and threatens the individual  
rights protected by our U.S. Constitution.

<h2>The U.N.'s Checkered Past</h2></center>
<P>

 
Before we get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding the 50th  
anniversary of the United Nations, let's review the checkered past of this  
would-be world government. 
                                                          <P>
The United Nations was designed to serve the interests of the Soviet  
Union. The principal author of the UN Charter, and its first Secretary  
General, was Communist spy Alger Hiss, and the only nation allotted  
three votes, rather than one, was the Soviet Union. The second UN  
Secretary General, Trygve Lie (PRONOUNCED: LEE), revealed in his  
book, called In the Cause of Peace, that U.S. Secretary of State Edward  
Stettinius made a deal with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that the  
second most important position in the UN would always be held by a  
Communist. 
                                   <P>
From the beginning, the Soviet Union used the UN as a headquarters for  
espionage and terror. According to the 1956 Annual Report of the Senate  
Internal Security Subcommittee, "Accreditation to a diplomatic or  
semidiplomatic position frequently has been given to members of the  
Soviet secret police as a 'cover' for their real objectives in the United  
States.... Soviet agents have engaged, within the boundaries of the U.S.,  
in kidnapping and coercion of foreign nationals who are United States  
residents."                      <P>
 
The Soviet Union also used the UN as a platform in the heart of New  
York City from which to spread revolutionary and subversive  
propaganda. A UN delegate from Poland who defected to the United  
States testified that his Soviet masters considered the UN "one of the  
most important platforms for Soviet propaganda in the world." In 1952 a  
Senate investigation into the "Activities of United States Citizens  
Employed by the United Nations" produced voluminous evidence that  
"there is a Communist 'fifth column' operating within the UN  
Secretariat." 
                                                              <P>
The first war waged by the UN was the Korean War of 1950-53. Korea  
became a battlefield only because the Soviet Union was temporarily  
boycotting the UN and the Soviet delegate was not present to cast a veto  
the day the United States requested UN action. Thereafter, however, the  
Soviets used their position and influence in the UN to force a stalemate in  
Korea. The Soviets never made the mistake of boycotting again, and  
never again did the UN lend assistance to the victims of Communism --  
among them Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia,  
Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rumania, and Tibet. 
                                                <P>
The UN did take immediate action in the Congo, however, speedily  
dispatching a "peace force" to wage war against the anti-communists of  
Katanga. UN troops killed women and children, attacked schools,  
hospitals, and churches, and used every means at their disposal to force  
the anti-communist Katangans into a Communist coalition government  
dominated by Soviet-trained agents. 
                                                         <P>
This is the history the United Nations will be celebrating next week --  
fifty years of smearing the reputation of the United States and  
undermining our interests, fifty years of providing a propaganda forum  
and an espionage base for the Soviet Union, fifty years of ignoring the  
victims of Communist aggression and actively helping to extend the  
reach of the evil empire.                   <P>

<title>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence</h2></center>
<P>

 
President Clinton has taken steps to ensure that the security of U.S.  
classified intelligence information is never compromised again by the  
likes of CIA mole Aldrich Ames. Leaks resulting from lax security  
practices at the United Nations, however, don't seem to concern him. 
  <P>
"A new politicized management team has been hired to shake up, purge,  
and otherwise discipline the CIA's covert operations directorate," reports  
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy. "This is being done in  
the name of preventing such disastrous compromises of U.S. intelligence"  
as those perpetrated by Aldrich Ames. "Yet, there appears to be one  
important exception to this policy," says Gaffney. "If the compromise  
occurs as the predictable result of sharing intelligence with the United  
Nations, it seems the Clinton administration is inclined to regard that as  
an acceptable cost of doing business." 
                     <P>
Sharing intelligence information with the United Nations can be risky  
indeed. Gaffney points out that UN personnel in Somalia were "rather  
casual about safeguarding classified information supplied by the United  
States. In fact, had it not been for a chance discovery by a U.S. diplomat  
literally turning out the lights as the UN bailed out of Mogadishu,  
sensitive data -- some of which reportedly identified the Somali sources --  
would have been compromised." 
                          <P>
This near-disaster was not unprecedented. "There have been at least four  
incidents in which the United Nations has breached the security of  
classified documents provided by the United States," reports Gaffney.  
Until recently, in fact, "there was no agreement in place obliging the  
United Nations to provide for the protection of intelligence supplied by  
the United States." Gaffney says the Clinton administration seems to  
believe that "it would be demeaning to the Secretary-General even to ask  
for such an agreement." 
                              <P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee amended the Foreign Relations  
Revitalization Act so that it "blocks the provision of U.S. intelligence  
information to the United Nations, its employees. or any associated  
organization unless mechanisms 'have been formally agreed to and  
implemented by the United Nations for protecting intelligence methods  
and sources."' The United Nations would thus be required to "adopt  
background investigation and security violation investigation procedures  
comparable to those employed by the United States government; agree to  
protect U.S.-provided intelligence in a similar manner; immediately  
notify Washington if there has been a security breach . . . and cooperate  
in U.S. Law enforcement investigations [of such breaches]; and ensure  
that U.S. classified data is not given to nationals ineligible for access to  
such information." 
                 <P>
Despite its boisterous attempt to prevent any further damage to U.S.  
intelligence efforts by double agents, the Clinton administration  
strenuously opposes efforts to protect U.S. intelligence from treachery or  
incompetence inside the UN. The lesson to be learned from the Ames  
affair, according to Frank Gaffney, is that intelligence sources "are highly  
perishable and, once exposed, are gone for good." He warns that  
"undisciplined, indiscriminate sharing of classified information with the  
United Nations" is sheer folly. 
                         <P>

<title>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment</h2></center>
<P>
 
 
The United States spent more than three and a half billion dollars on the  
United Nations in 1994, which included a billion dollars just to support  
the UN's so-called "peacekeeping" operations and nearly two billion  
dollars' worth of military support services. What did we get for all those  
billions? Not much! 
        <P>
"The UN has been, and will continue to be, of only marginal relevance to  
international peace and security," says Thomas Sheehy of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Suggesting otherwise only sets the stage for future policy  
debacles involving the U.S. military." Sheehy argues that "UN  
peacekeeping turns disastrous when it takes the form of 'peacemaking."'  
That's because "UN forces quickly become just another group of  
combatants," fighting at a tremendous disadvantage under UN rules of  
engagement. 
                         <P>
Sheehy points out that "the countries providing peacekeepers have  
considerably less interest in the conflicts than do the forces their troops  
are fighting. As casualties are incurred, pressure mounts to bring the  
troops home," he observes. "The result is often a half-hearted and  
ultimately futile operation that suffers casualties in vain, as the U.S. did  
in Somalia." Sheehy adamantly rejects suggestions that "U.S. hesitancy to  
intervene in Bosnia and elsewhere . . . is immoral. The 'immoral' policy,"  
he insists, "is to suffer casualties in a conflict with no bearing to  
American national security and soon after to abandon the U.S.  
commitment, as was done in Somalia." 
                                  <P>
The Clinton administration argues that the U.S. would be forced "to act  
alone or not at all" if it refused to participate in UN operations. This is  
simply not true. "The U.S. has acted in concert with allies in most of its  
international conflicts," Sheehy observes. The main concern of UN  
boosters like the President is obviously "not for American security, but  
for the prestige of the UN, which suffers considerably without active  
American participation." According to Sheehy, "Collective action on a  
regional basis, such as in NATO and during the Persian Gulf War,  
whether or not it is sanctioned by the UN, undoubtedly is the best way to  
maintain international peace and stability." 
                                               <P>
Charles Lichenstein, also of the Heritage Foundation, warns that the UN  
"is reinventing what used to be called 'peacekeeping.' In the last several  
years, that do-good concept has been stretched to encompass a range of  
UN operations that typically involve the use of force, even the waging of  
war." The term "peacekeeping" now means "almost anything . . . that the  
UN wants it to mean." Lichenstein says as many as 70,000 U.S. military  
personnel currently participate in this misnamed process. "Some are  
serving in war zones, some are offshore or in aerial surveillance and  
interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving under  
the authority only of UN Security Council resolutions as implemented by  
the U.S. commander-in-chief." Lichenstein concludes that it would be  
better for the U.S. to "act alone" than to get caught up in "ill-defined,  
open-ended 'peace' operations that arguably exceed the UN's authority  
and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence."

<title>U.S. Soldier Refuses to Submit to U.N. Authority -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.S. Soldier Refuses to Submit to U.N. Authority</h2></center>
<P>

 
U.S. Army Specialist Michael New was scheduled to join a United  
Nations "peacekeeping" force in Bosnia early this month, but Specialist  
New decided to risk the possibility of court martial, dishonorable  
discharge, and a prison term rather than wear the UN insignia on his  
uniform. 
        <P>
When Michael New joined the U.S. Army and swore an oath to uphold  
the Constitution of the United States, no mention was made of the United  
Nations. No one said anything about swearing allegiance to a would-be  
world government. or being subject to service under its alien command.  
That's why Michael New balked when he was ordered to wear the UN  
insignia. Up to that point, he had been a typical American soldier, subject  
to the command of American military officers and possessed of all the  
rights of an American citizen -- and that's what he wanted to remain. 
                             <P>
Specialist New demanded to know how a UN emblem on his uniform  
would affect his status as a soldier in the U.S. Army. Would he still be in  
the service of the United States, or would he be considered to be in the  
service of the United Nations instead? If taken prisoner during the UN's  
"peacekeeping mission," would he be treated as an American POW or as  
a UN hostage? Michael New's superiors refused to answer those crucially  
important questions. 
                        <P>
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? 
                                      <P>
Taking a pass on those prickly posers, the Army argued that President  
Clinton as commander-in-chief had lawfully ordered American soldiers  
to wear the UN insignia, and that's the end of that. The alleged lawfulness  
of the order presumably derives from a classified Presidential Directive  
of May 3, 1994, in which Clinton asserted his authority "to place U.S.  
forces under the operational control of a foreign commander." Cuddy  
says that "one reason New has asked for an explanation of how his status  
would change if he wore UN insignias is to determine if this order  
actually is lawful." Cuddy contends that it is unconstitutional, and that  
Army Specialist Michael New is "correct to refuse to wear UN insignia  
over his American uniform." 
                                                 <P>
Why all the fuss about a silly little emblem? Dennis Cuddy argues that  
obscuring the national identities of troops participating in a UN  
peacekeeping mission and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates  
"a change of command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops  
that it can truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted  
it to be -- "a de facto world government."

<title>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights</h2></center>
<P>

 
Despite their lofty rhetoric, the various treaties proposed by the United  
Nations would not give Americans any additional rights. What they  
would do is restrict or repeal many of the rights we already have, and  
Americans certainly don't want that! 
 <P>
A treaty is a solemn agreement between nations that is legally binding on  
the signatory governments, and on their peoples. U.S. diplomats have no  
business participating in the drafting of treaties that threaten our nation's  
sovereignty and the Constitutional rights of American citizens. U.S.  
Presidents have no business signing such treaties. And U.S. Senators  
have no business ratifying them. 
                <P>
It is incumbent upon anyone sworn to uphold our Constitution to be ever  
mindful of the impact a treaty may have on it and to examine such a  
potent document scrupulously, anticipating contrary constructions and  
adverse interpretations of ambiguous terms. The preservation of U.S.  
sovereignty and of the liberties of American citizens should be the  
primary concern at all times -- not the self-esteem of statesmen, or  
fearsome but fictitious "world opinion." Willfully jeopardizing the  
security of our country, whether in the interests of a foreign nation or as a  
prelude to world government, is treason plain and simple. 
                           <P>
Treaties pose far more of a hazard to the United States than to any other  
nation because of the preeminence of treaties in our system of  
government. Under the U.S. Constitution, laws passed by Congress must  
be "in pursuance" of the Constitution, but there is no such express  
limitation on treaties. In an address to the American Bar Association in  
1952, former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles acknowledged the  
grave danger inherent in treaty ratification. "Under our Constitution  
treaties become the supreme law of the land," he explained. "They are  
indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are  
invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws  
can override the Constitution." 
                                    <P>
The various UN treaties, which internationalist pressure groups are  
constantly urging us to sign, have nothing to offer the American people.  
On the contrary, they pose serious threats to the blessings of liberty that  
we already enjoy. These treaties would supersede the U.S. Constitution  
that protects our rights, override our federal and state laws, and upset the  
balance of power unique to our federal system. They provide no real  
benefits to the citizens of other countries either, and the sacrifice of our  
own rights would not be justified even if they did. We would not be  
protected by the so-called Reservations and Statements of Understanding  
which could be attached. They serve only to acknowledge the many  
dangers in the treaties.   <P>
 
Any treaty that threatens the rights of Americans -- the rights our  
forefathers fought so hard for -- is a treaty we can do without. Nor do we  
advance the cause of human rights worldwide by diminishing our  
sovereignty. We serve that cause far better by concentrating on concerns  
closer to home and trying to set a noble example for others to follow. Let  
the tricksters have their treaties. America should perfect its own standard  
of human rights, and let other nations follow our lead. 
                                     <P>

<h2>Any U.N. Treaty is a Treaty We Can Do Without</h2></center>
<P>

 
Any United Nations treaty is a treaty we can do without, because it will  
surely threaten the rights of Americans . 
 <P>
One of Douglas MacArthur's famous lines was, "Old soldiers never die,  
they just fade away." Unfortunately, old treaties not only never die; they  
don't even fade away. Old treaties retain their life forever. Also,  
unfortunately, the United Nations has some old treaties lying around, and  
we must be ever-vigilant if we are to be sure they are never ratified. 
             <P>
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights would change  
the marriage laws of most of our states in the name of equality and  
thereby repeal the fundamental legal rights possessed by American wives.  
This Treaty would give carte blanche to some future international  
tribunal by insisting that all persons are "entitled without discrimination  
to equal protection of the law," without defining what that means. The  
Treaty would allow any foreign government, friendly or unfriendly. to  
accuse the United States of violation. It wouldn't take very long for the  
envious nations of the world to begin their feeding frenzy. How much  
sympathy do you think we would receive from a UN human rights  
committee stacked against us? 
                       <P>
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  
Discrimination would require the United States to "prohibit and bring to  
an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by  
circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or  
organization." This provision would override our First Amendment right  
to freedom of association in private clubs and other private action. A UN  
Committee would hear complaints against us, without revealing the  
identities of the complainants. The Treaty's enormously broad  
descriptions of racial discrimination would offer endless opportunities for  
mischief as the Committee demands explanations and remedies for our  
alleged transgressions. 
                              <P>
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
would require the United States to "recognize the right of everyone [in  
the world] to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family,  
including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous  
improvement of living conditions." It would further require that we  
"ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to  
need." How would we recognize that "right," and how would we ensure  
that "equitable distribution"? With an ever-increasing transfer of 
American wealth, that's how! 
                                        <P>
The worst aspect of the UN Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural  
Rights is its refusal to include the fundamental right to own property.  
This is why the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon. and  
Ford Administrations consistently took the position that the United States  
would not sign it. President Jimmy Carter reversed this position and  
signed it, which means this UN treaty is sitting around in the bottom  
drawer waiting for a chance to be ratified. 
                 <P>
All these UN treaties are bad news for the United States, and a threat to  
our constitutional liberties. If you hear that any UN treaty is being  
considered in the U.S. Senate, be sure to tell your Senator to vote no.

<title>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty</h2></center>
<P>

 
The proposed UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a good example of  
why Americans should vigorously oppose all efforts to transform the UN  
into an organization with real authority. This Treaty would override the  
U.S. Constitution, giving the federal government power over children that  
supersedes the rights of parents. 
                <P>
The underlying premise of the United States Constitution is that all  
individuals are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.  
Our Constitution serves to protect those preexisting rights against  
encroachment by government. So-called human rights treaties proposed  
by the UN, on the other hand, presuppose that individual rights originate  
with the treaties themselves, or with the governments of signatory  
nations. This is a crucial distinction, because what government gives  
government can take away. 
                <P>
The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a case in point. The Treaty  
purports to give the child the right to express his own views freely in all  
matters, to receive information of any kind from whatever source, to  
choose his own religion, and to enjoy "rest and leisure." Back talk and  
blasphemy are therefore protected, as are propaganda and pornography,  
cults and covens, idleness and iniquity -- any interest or activity indulged  
in by an undisciplined child. 
                        <P>
The Treaty would serve to protect these supposed rights of children not  
against the encroachment of government, but against the encroachment of  
parents. By denying the right of parents to raise their offspring as they see  
fit and by encouraging the rebellion of sons and daughters, the Treaty  
would divide the family into warring factions, effectively destroying the  
one institution that truly does protect the rights of children. 
                                   <P>
This UN Treaty stipulates that primary education be "compulsory and  
available free to all," giving no indication as to whether this provision  
would either require the subsidization of private and religious schools or  
prohibit their existence altogether. Prescribing school curriculum with a  
specificity contrary to our custom, the Treaty calls for inculcating in all  
children respect for "the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United  
Nations," for "civilizations different from his or her own," for the  
"equality of sexes," and for "the natural environment." The glorification  
of such things will no doubt be accompanied by the stigmatization of  
religious faith, American culture, heterosexuality, traditional families,  
and private enterprise. 
                 <P>
The Treaty would also require our government to "ensure the  
development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of  
children" and to establish universal standards for protecting young  
persons against neglect, exploitation, and abuse. Refusing to surrender  
one's child to the care of a government-approved institution may be  
presumed to constitute incontrovertible evidence of neglect. Who's to  
decide? A new international bureaucracy, of course, which will be  
established to monitor abuse of the bogus rights created by the Treaty. A  
committee of ten so-called experts will supervise this effort, and you can  
bet your first-born baby that their view of what's proper for your progeny  
will not coincide with yours. 
                        <P>

<h2>Oppose The UN Convention on Discrimination Against Women</h2></center>
<P>

 
The United Nations Convention on Discrimination Against Women  
would upset the constitutional balance of power between our federal and  
state governments, undermine many of the rights possessed by American  
women, and subject our society to regulation by a committee of  
international inquisitors. 
                            <P>
The very first article of the UN Treaty on Women should have aroused  
the suspicions of every U.S. Senator. How could anyone sworn to uphold  
the U.S. Constitution fail to recognize the impropriety of ratifying a  
treaty that candidly promises to control "private organizations and even  
interpersonal relationships," and to reach into areas that are not regulated  
by the federal government? Neither magnifying glass nor fine-tooth comb  
was needed to examine this treaty; the threats it poses to our nation's  
sovereignty and the rights of American citizens are writ large! 
                       <P>
Article 2. for example, would invalidate laws that register males only for  
military service and assign males only to combat duty. Does any Senator  
believe that the majority of the American people favor the drafting of  
women and their assignment to the combat infantry? Article 2 would also  
require Congress to pass "appropriate corrective legislation" to regulate  
"membership in private clubs or organizations." Would this mean the  
sexual integration of women's colleges, of professional sports  
organizations, of Scout troops, of convents and monasteries? You bet it  
would! 
                               <P>
That's not the half of it. Make no mistake about it: what we're talking  
about here is the other half In the interest of eliminating alleged  
discrimination against the half of the population that is female,  
everything must be cut in half. Article 4 authorizes strict sexual quotas in  
employment, stipulating that special measures "aimed at accelerating de  
facto equality between men and women shall not be considered  
discrimination." Article 10 would require the "elimination of any  
stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all  
forms of education, " and that means both public and private schools. 
                                       <P>
Article 11 would require Congress to legislate Comparable Worth, the  
feminist notion that government functionaries should establish wage  
scales based on their own subjective notions of "value." Never mind the  
influence of such market variables as the availability of labor, the demand  
for a given product or service, and the cost of living in a given area.  
Never mind that all the countries that rely on government-set wages have  
lower wages, and lower standards of living, than we Americans do.  
Article 11 would also require "the establishment and development of a  
network of child-care facilities," so that all women would be free to cast  
off the joys of motherhood and revel in the drudgery of wage labor.  
Article 16 would keep down the demand for such child care facilities by  
providing for abortion on demand. To make sure that all the preceding  
articles are adhered to, Article 17 would bring us under the supervision of  
a committee of 23 so-called experts elected from countries dominated by  
repressive regimes.

<title>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects</h2></center>
<P>
 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA) and the  
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (called GATT) are wreaking  
havoc on the U.S. economy, but it's not too late to save our sovereignty. 
   <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade (known as ACCT) plans  
this month to file the first of several legal challenges to the NAFTA and  
GATT treaties and the $53 million bailout of Mexico. The Coalition is  
determined to block the implementation of these sovereignty-usurping  
treaties before they cause any more damage. Former U.S. Customs  
Commissioner William von Raab has signed on with the ACCT Lawyers  
Committee supervising the legal challenges, which is headed by  
America's Future Chairman Robert Morris. 
                       <P>
Two years ago, at an ACCT conference on NAFTA, von Raab predicted  
that passage of the trade agreement linking the Mexican and American  
economies would lead to "chaos on the border," and so it has. "Trucks are  
rolling across the Rio Grande by the thousands," ACCT reports, "many of  
them loaded with cocaine and other illegal drugs now being sold on the  
streets and in the school yards all across our country." Thomas Considine,  
director of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Administration.  
advised a Senate committee in August that drug gangs in Mexico could  
eventually rival the ruthless ring now operating in Colombia. According  
to the Washington Times, these gangs routinely rob Southern Pacific  
freight trains "carrying millions of dollars in consumer goods" hecho en  
Mexico and destined for the U.S. market. 
                                  <P>
A Congressional Joint Economic Committee reported that "Mexican  
imports to this country cost the United States 137,000 jobs" in the nine  
months following passage of NAFTA. Imports from Mexico have soared  
since then, perhaps tripling the job-loss figure. "Trade with Mexico has  
been a big factor in the expanding U.S. trade deficit this year," says trade  
correspondent Richard Lawrence in the August 1 8th Journal of  
Commerce. In the first six months of this year, "the U.S. posted an $8.5  
billion merchandise deficit in Mexican trade, compared with a $1 .1  
billion surplus a year earlier." 
                    <P>
A study by Vanderbilt University documents some of the specific  
consequences of NAFTA: tomato production down 25 percent in Florida,  
Scott Paper Company cutting more than 10,000 jobs worldwide prior to  
opening multimillion-dollar plants in Mexico, the virtual elimination of  
the apparel industry in the United States. Syndicated columnist Sam  
Francis says the impact of NAFTA can be measured in "the destruction of  
whole lives, careers and lifetime hopes . . . as plants relocate,  
communities vanish, neighborhoods stagnate and opportunities for  
Middle Americans gurgle away forever in the backwash of NAFTA's  
sweep through the American economy and society." 
                         <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade is determined to  
document the true cost of NAFTA and GATT and to see that these  
treaties are revoked before that cost soars even higher. Their efforts may  
determine whether or not America remains a land of opportunity.

<title>Duplantier:  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS ADVOCACY GROUPS</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>Federal Government Supports Advocacy Groups</h2></center>
<P>


   

[The U.S. Government awards more than $39 billion a year in grants to 
advocacy groups that most Americans would not support, if given a 
choice. That's $39 billion of our money to promote ideas we don't agree with!]
<p>
The American Association of Retired Persons (known as AARP) 
received more than $73 million in taxpayer funds in a single year. The 
National Trust for Historic Preservation raked in $7 million. The AFL-
CIO and the American Bar Association each garnered more than $2 
million. Neither the lawyers lobby nor any other group is entitled to such handouts, but they obviously have no scruples about asking for them. 
<p>"The financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount 
funneled to these organizations," say Marshall Wittrnann and Charles 
Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "Each one not only lobbies for its 
contract or grant but also advocates for bigger, more expensive social 
welfare programs."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin have no objection to privately funded advocacy. "It 
is an entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of 
the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which 
lobby Congress or other government entities." This practice is an affront 
to Americans of all political persuasions. "It is ever bit as unjust to force 
liberal taxpayers to fund organizations on the right as it is to force 
conservative taxpayers to finance organizations on the left." say 
Wittmann and Griffin. Taxpayers should not be forced "to underwrite 
advocacy with which they disagree."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin argue that taxpayer funding of advocacy 
organizations is wrong on at least three levels: "It is fiscally irresponsible 
to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return 
to American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides 
in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite 
few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that 
often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."
<p>
Our Founding Fathers took great pains to design a government that 
would discourage the growth of factions who seek to promote their own 
special interests without regard to the common good or the rights of 
other citizens. "Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal 
government today subsidizes them," say Wittmann and Griffin. "This 
distorts the political process by favoring one faction over another and by 
nourishing a network of special interests" committed to the growth of 
government.
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin call for "tougher laws" that would put an end to 
the subsidization of factions. They recommend that witnesses testifying 
before Congress "be required to divulge . . . whether they receive federal 
funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount." They insist that 
any organization receiving federal funds should be prohibited not only 
from lobbying, but also from maintaining "organizational ties to any 
entity that engages in lobbying activity." This, they say, is the only way 
to make sure that no American is "compelled to finance lobbying 
activities with which he disagrees."

Duplantier</a> <brNovember 14, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>Multiculturalism is A Step Back</h2></center><P>



[Multiculturalism is the new pet theory of academicians and policy 
planners, but the evidence indicates that cultural diversity often leads to 
social conflict, retards economic progress, and restricts personal 
freedom.]
<p>
                      

The freedom that leads to economic growth is more likely to be found in 
a homogenous society, says Gerald Scully of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis. "Economic freedom and rule of law are fundamental for 
high levels of economic growth," contends Scully. "Security of property, 
freedom of contract, and free market exchange promote capital formation 
and, hence. economic growth. A legal system based on law rather than 
men's whims stabilizes the rules under which resources are allocated." 
<p>Without individual freedom and a legal system that protects it, 
"transforming poor nations into rich nations is virtually impossible." 
says Scully. Poor nations are often characterized by cultural diversitv. 
which leads to "social conflict," a loss of freedom. and a stagnant 
economy.
<p>
All the various immigrant groups that came to America brought with 
them their "own culture, some elements of which were thought to be 
inconsistent with American values." Scully notes that. until recently, our 
national policy was "to homogenize immigrants -- to make them speak 
English and disabuse them of radical political beliefs." As long as we 
maintained this policy. we "managed cultural conflict better than the rest 
of the world." says Scully. "The tension of absorbing different cultures 
through immigration has been partly diffused because of institutions that 
protect individual freedom. and because attempts have been made to 
bring immigrants into the cultural mainstream."
<p>
The problem with multicultural societies is that "the ethnocentric 
differences of race, religion, ethnicity and language often lead to 
enmity." The violence in Northern Ireland. the separatist movement in 
Quebec. the terrorism in Palestine, the ethnic rioting in India -- all are 
manifestations of multicultural madness. "Even if different groups live 
together peacefully," Scully contends, "the lack of a common language 
and common norms reduces cooperation" and drives up the cost of 
commerce.
<p>
Imposing socialist policies can retard economic growth in any society, of 
course, but in multicultural societies "intergroup conflict may result in 
additional economic inefficiency, lower the growth rate, and even turn 
violent. Hostilities make property insecure. which slows the rate of 
capital accumulation. Eventually, in culturally diverse societies, one 
cultural group tends to dominate and to suppress violence and manage 
enmity." That domination generally takes the form of "discriminatory 
restrictions on occupational choice? denial of educational opportunities, 
licensing of trade, confiscation of land, nationalization of business, 
restrictions on property [and] exchange and mobilitv restrictions," all of 
which have an adverse economic impact on society as a whole.
<p>
Scully laments the passing of America's "melting pot" method of 
assimilating immigrants, which combined "disparate elements into a 
common substance." The common rights we shared as individuals, no 
matter what our ethnic origin, are now being replaced by "group rights." 
<p>This is a dangerous development, "because emphasizing our cultural 
differences may exacerbate intergroup enmity and lead to social 
breakdown."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 15, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>United Nations Repatriates Asian Refugees</h2></center><P>



       

[The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has long denied 
reports that it mistreats Asian refugees, forcibly returning many of them 
to the Communist countries from which they fled. But now former 
officials of the UN High Commission have come forward to confirm 
those reports.]
<p>
Officials of the United Nations High Cornrnission on Refugees and 
spokesmen from our own State Department persist in claiming that 
screening procedures for the Vietnamese and Laotian refugees detained 
in holding camps in Thailand. Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia are 
fair and orderly. They also maintain that the poor souls who have been 
repatriated have nothing to fear from the ruthless thugs who rule their 
homelands. These claims have now been challenged, however -- by 
former officials of the UN High Commission itself.
<p>
One such official is Simon Jeans, an Australian attorney who served as a 
legal consultant to the UN High Commission on Refugees in Indonesia 
in 1992. At a recent House of Representatives subcommittee hearing. 
Jeans testified to rampant corruption by the Indonesian officers in charge 
of the refugee camps. "Corruption in Indonesia was systematic," said 
Jeans. Bribes and sexual favors were the price paid for preferential 
treatment.
<p>
Another witness before the House subcommittee was Wa Vue. a leader of 
the Hmong tribal people of Laos. This tribe was an unwavering 
Arnerican ally during the Vietnam war, and its members were postwar 
victims of a violent campaign of genocide by the communist Lao 
government. More than l 00 000 Hmong have found sanctuary in the 
United States, but thousands more live in daily dread of repatriation as 
they languish in the holding camps in Thailand.
<p>
Wa Vue and his father, Vue Mai, were detained in one of those camps. 
Vue Mai was active in a resistance movement known as the United Front 
for the Liberation of Laos. Officials from the UN High Commission and 
the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok persuaded Vue Mai to give up this effort 
and return to Laos. In November 1992 a State Department 
representative, accompanied by Thai and UN officials. escorted Vue Mai 
to the border. He was to meet with Lao officials and arrange for the 
resettlement of a large number of Hmong refugees. In October 1993 he 
disappeared in Laos and has not been heard from since. On February 26, 
1995, the rest of the Vue clan -- except for Vue Mai's wife and his son, 
Wa Vue -- were rounded up and forcibly returned, presumably to suffer a 
similar fate.
<p>
"This tragic tale is further evidence that the United States should 
reexamine its role in refugee screening and treatment in Southeast Asia," 
argues James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of 
Freedom. "Contrary to State Department assertions, the House 
subcommittee hearing brought out further evidence that such screening 
is extremely unfair, corrupt, and often violent." Many of the refugees 
from tyrannical regimes in Southeast Asia were loyal allies of the U.S. 
during the Vietnam War, says Tyson. "We have a real obligation to see 
that they receive equitable hearings."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 16, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-Poverty Program Supports Leftist Causes</h2></center><P>




[Every year on the weekend before Thanksgiving, American Catholics 
are asked to contribute to their Church's Campaign for Human 
Development (known as CHD). More and more Catholics are declining 
to do so, however, as they learn about the Campaign's strange support for 
radical, left-wing organizations.]
<p>
The Capital Research Center in Washington DC reports that the 
Campaign for Human Development. the antipoverty program of the 
American Catholic bishops. is not at all what the faithful have been led 
to believe it is. If American Catholics had had any idea where the money 
really goes, they would not have dumped more than $230 million into 
the CHD collection baskets over the past 25 years. "What they are not 
told. and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want them to know." the 
Capital Research Center charges. "is that most of CHD's money goes to 
support liberal activists who use it teach people how to organize and 
agitate for more government spending programs."
<p>
Adding insult to injury. "CHD-funded activists are often openly 
disdainful of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Whose offerings they 
gladly accept." CHD's 25th anniversary conference, held three months 
ago in Chicago. provided a good example of the persons and policies 
unwittinglv promoted by pious parishioners. Conference participants 
were treated to speeches By "a Marxist college professor. pro-abortion 
and pro-gay rights activists. and a strident opponent of school choice."
<p>
The Campaign for Human Development "operates on the same 
assumptions as Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty," providing no 
incentives for "individual striving and responsibility." According to the 
Capital Research Center. "Rather than offer the poor the example of 
success, and guidance in achieving it. CHD explains why poverty is the 
system's fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions." Despite its 
claims of nonpartisanship, "almost all of its activities fall on the left -- 
often the far-left -- side of the ideological spectrum. CHD-funded groups 
invariably favor public policies that require state intervention and 
decision-making. And these build support for their positions by resorting 
to the rhetoric of class consciousness and the tactics of social conflict."
<p>
The Capital Research Center contends that "CHD has established a long 
track record of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would 
find repugnant." It also has a history of responding to the problems of 
society with solutions that "preclude genuine Christian social action. By 
concentrating on tried-and-failed methods of victimization and blame, 
CHD undermines the individual's capacity for spiritual, moral, and social 
renewal."
<p>
The Capital Research Center implores the American bishops "to initiate 
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human 
Development," urging them to "exercise active oversight, not rubber-
stamp decisions by CHD professional staff." If nothing else, the bishops 
should be "honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of 
CHD." In the meantime, if American Catholics want to know what 
they're contributing to, they'll have to conduct their own investigations.

FLYNN</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 17, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>The Enduring Wisdom of John T. Flynn</h2></center><P>


[Noted journalist and author John T. Flynn warned more than 50 years 
ago that America was headed down "the road to Socialism. " His 
recommendations for averting disaster are just as valid today as they 
were then.]
<p>
In a book called The Road Ahead, published decades ago, the late John 
T. Flynn argued that Americans committed to fighting the creeping 
advance of socialism in our country must first "rid themselves of the 
moral intimidation which has been imposed on their minds." An excerpt 
from that book appears in a new compilation of Flynn's writing entitled 
Forgotten Lessons. published by the Foundation for Economic 
Education. Flynn noted that "the American system has been painted as 
something wicked. bungling. even brutal. while the Planned New World 
of the future will be filled with sweetness, light, and plenty." This false 
picture has had an impact not only on naive Americans, but also on 
those who ought to know better.
<p>
John T. Flynn observed that the choice before us is not "between a 
perfect system called Socialism and an imperfect system called 
Capitalism. It is a choice between two human systems both of which will 
inevitably have their imperfections because they are human. But the 
Socialist Planners do not concede this. Capitalism they present to us only 
in terms of its defects. But Socialism is painted only in terms of the 
wonderful things it is going to do some day." Citing the disastrous effects 
of Socialism in Russia. Germany. Italy. and Britain. Flynn reminded his 
readers that "the greatest and most efficient producing machine in the 
world is in [America]. This did not happen by accident " he asserted. "It 
is the result of the soil of freedom in which it grew."
<p>
Socialism was far advanced in America even in Flys day, and it has 
gained ground since then. Fort years later we are still confronted with 
the need to counteract what Fly called "the social disease that is 
destroying us." Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop apologizing for our 
Capitalist society." We should take no more steps down the road to 
Socialism. he said. and we should turn out of office any politician who 
tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out. Iong before Dan 
Quayle and Pat Buchanan. "that we are in a social war. and that we must 
fight it as such." He said we should "put an end to the orgy of spending 
that is rapidly bankrupt the nation," quit trying to plan our economy, and 
instead let "our free system of private enterprise operate at its fullest 
capacity."
<p>
John T. Flynn was a founding member of America's Future, the producer 
of this series of broadcasts, and a man of great wisdom and vision. Flynn 
advised his readers to rediscover their principles in the U.S. 
Constitution. the Declaration of Independence, and American history -- 
and use those principles "to dismantle the tyrant State in America and to 
build up once again the energies of a free people."

<html><head><title>Duplantier:  CLINTONS CIVIL SERVICE REFORM FLAWED</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 20, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Clinton's Civil Service Reform Flawed</h2></center><P>



             

President Clinton has made much of his plan to "reinvent government, " 
but a prominent management consultant says the President's proposed 
reforms would only make matters worse.
<p>
President Clinton promised to overhaul the federal civil service so as "to 
make the entire federal government both less expensive and more 
efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy awav 
from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment." 
But Donald J. Devine. former director of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management says that "this reinvention will weaken management. Iead 
to greater inefficiencies. dilute individual performance initiative. 
reinforce the culture of complacency. and make government less 
accountable."
<p>
In a Heritage Foundation report entitled "Making Government Work," 
Device argues that the President's proposed reforms downplay the 
importance of individual merit and performance and shift control over 
the executive branch from the President to federal bureaucrats and 
unions. "Instead of reinventing government." savs Devine, "Clinton's 
proposals would make things worse by transferring leadership to 
committees and unions and assuring weak executive leadership."
<p>
President Clinton's proposals ignore the key principles of "real 
government reform." says Devine. the first of which is to "keep the 
mission simple." To be successful. every government agency must have 
"a simple. clear mission with an imaginative leadership dedicated to that 
mission." Unfortunately. "government missions have become enormously 
more complex" than they used to be. and civil servants are now saddled 
with responsibilities that are ill-defined or contradictory. "Government." 
Devine insists. "can work effectively only when relatively few things are 
assigned unambiguously to a few institutions with sufficient esprit le 
corps to do them well."
<p>
Devine notes that our central government has "strayed far from its 
federalist roots" and recommends that its scope be strictly limited once 
again. "Functions properly performed by the states should be transferred 
back to them." he says. The federal government should also take 
advantage of the "reduced costs. greater efficiency, and improved 
management that flow from contracting work out to the private sector."
<p>
Devine calls for the reestablishment of "a true merit system." The hiring 
and promotion of civil servants must be based on "knowledge, skills, and 
abilities" once again. he says. The President and his department heads 
must accept and assert their responsibility for the activities of the 
executive branch. Devine notes that "the thrust of the Clinton reforms is 
to remove authority from the political and career executives . . . and 
transfer it to labor-management councils." This is foolish and 
irresponsible. says Devine. "Without political leadership. when the 
President gives an order, there is no reason to assume anything will 
happen down the line in the federal bureaucracy. That is why 
responsibility in current law rests with the political agency head." 
Devine argues that "effective government management requires strong 
agency leadership," which in turn requires straightforward missions and 
clear-cut performance standards.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 21, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Affirmative Action Discriminates Against Whites</h2></center><P>


   

[The debate over affirmative action and the alleged disparity in 
opportunities for whites and blacks overlooks one thing -- not all blacks 
are alike, and neither are all whites.]
<p>
In a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, former U.S. Navy Secretary 
James Webb pointed out that "differences among white ethnic groups are 
huge. fed by cultural tradition, the time and geography of migrations to 
the country, and . . . the tendency of white Americans to discriminate 
against other whites in favor of their own class and culture." Webb cited 
a 1974 study by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research 
Center that divided white Americans into 17 distinct ethnic and religious 
backgrounds.
<p>
The study ranked these 17 separate groups according to their educational 
and financial status. and the results were not what you might have 
expected. "Contrary to prevailing mythology, the vaunted White Anglo-
Saxon Protestants were even then not at the top," said Webb. Jews in 
fact, led the list. followed by Irish. Italian. German. and Polish 
Catholics, in that order. Educational attainment and income levels 
within each group were consistent throughout the country which would 
seem to indicate that differences among the groups are "culturally rather 
than geographically based."
<p>
According to that 1974 study, white families at the top of this list earned 
nearly $5000 more per year than white families at the bottom. The 
income difference between whites and blacks as a whole, at the time. was 
less than $4000. The obvious conclusion, according to Webb, is that. 
"even prior to the major affirmative action programs, there was a greater 
variation within 'white America' than there was between 'white America' 
and black America. and the whites at the bottom were in approximately 
the same situation as blacks."
<p>
The whites at the bottom are the ones who have felt the brunt of 
affirmative action. at the very time when a shrinking industrial base and 
a declining public school system are diminishing their prospects for self-
improvement. But sympathy for their plight is not in fashion. "The 
prevailing attitude has been to ridicule whites who have the audacity to 
complain about their reduced status." said Webb. and to rationalize 
policies that discriminate against them as remedies for a "past wrong."
<p>
Webb says the working-class white male "sees a government system that 
seems bent on belittling the basis of his existence, and has established a 
set of laws and regulations that often keep him from competing His 
evermore-isolated leaders have mandated [a so-called] 'equal 
opportunity' bureaucracy in the military . government and industry . . . 
whose sole function is to report 'political incorrectness' and to encourage 
the promotion of literally everyone but him and his kind." The current, 
coercive celebration of "diversity" has no appeal to the white male at the 
bottom of the ladder. To him, diversity is "a code word used to exclude 
him . . . no matter the extent of his qualifications and no matter the 
obstacles he has had to overcome."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 22, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Unfunded Mandates Shackle States</h2></center><P>



           

[State governments used to agree to almost anything to get on the federal 
gravy train. Now that Washington is making them pay for the ride, some 
states want to get off that train.]
<p>
Unfunded mandates. That's what the uproar's about. It seems the federal 
government is imposing more and more obligations on state 
governments without providing the funds necessary to pay for them. and 
so the states have to come up with the money themselves. Having to raise 
millions of dollars to comply with federal regulations. Or divert funds 
from their own programs, does not sit well with state officials. It's 
patently unfair, and it's unconstitutional. But, in the short run, it may be 
a good thing. After all. the states raised few objections as long as federal 
mandates were fully funded and they might never have complained if 
they hadn't felt the pinch.
<p>
How did the states get themselves into this fix? Thomas Atwood and 
Chris West of the Heritage Foundation explain: "States succumb to the 
temptation of federal funds and buy into a program; the people and the 
state become dependent on it; Congress changes the rules of the game: 
and the state is directed actually to change its law or even its constitution 
in order to continue receiving the popular funding. Strings-attached 
programs can lead to the federal government's virtually dictating state 
law. Yet. all too often. states have been quick to bargain ~" a! their 
autonomy in pursuit of federal dollars."
<p>
Complying with the dictates of the federal government used to be seen as 
"a small price to pay for federal funding of popular state-implemented 
programs." say Atwood and West. "But now the federal share of that 
funding is decreasing while the mandates are becoming more numerous. 
complex. and expensive. Unfunded federal mandates and highly 
prescriptive federal programs have backed many states and localities into 
a fiscal comer. forcing them to sacrifice their own programs and 
priorities in order to comply with standards set by a distant federal 
government."
<p>
Now at long last. state officials are "challenging the authority of the 
federal government to impose these mandates. whether funded or not." 
They're monitoring the votes of their Congressmen on mandates. They're 
challenging the federal government's ever-widening interpretation of the 
Constitution's Comrnerce Clause. Theyre accusing the federal 
government of violating the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the 
states and the people all powers not expressly delegated to the federal 
government. And on occasion, they're just plain refusing to comply.

Atwood and West warn that "the centralization of power in Washington 
threatens to smother America's enterprise and liberty." But the battle is 
joined, and the tide may be turning. "The states have the power, the 
authority, the opportunity, and the responsibility to rein in an out-of-
control federal government," say Atwood and West. All they need now is 
the will to assert themselves, and the determination to stick to their guns.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 23, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Thanksgiving Reflections</h2></center><P>


                           

[Today is a day to give thanks. But gratitude doesn't always come easily.]
<p>
It can be difficult to be grateful to someone who offers what is good for 
us when what is good for us is not what we want. Often we are grateful 
for the wrong things, the things that spoil us instead of the things that 
make us strong. As children we may appreciate the teacher who forgoes 
homework assignments. the parent who slips us cash without demanding 
any labor in return. and the aunt who plies us with candy. As ignorant. 
penniless adults with mouths full of cavities we ma! take the longer 
view.
<p>
Making a list of the gifts we have received can be a good way to develop 
our sense of gratitude and to sharpen our ability to recognize the hidden 
benefits in things that have not come gift-wrapped. We might begin our 
survey by listing those things that we recognize immediately as gifts: the 
presents we receive for birthdays. the year-end bonuses. the winning 
lottery tickets. Then w e might list those things we take for granted but 
would recognize as gifts if we thought about it: our health. our talents. 
the perfect weather for last weekend's picnic. Next, a list of rights. 
which. if we're honest. we will concede are not rights at all but privileges 
or gifts: life. liberty, property.
<p>
Last. we might list those burdens that -- if we think long and hard 
enough -- will be seen to provide some unexpected benefits and to 
constitute blessings in disguise: those long commutes that allow us time 
to plan and to reflect. the financial reverses that force us to draw closer 
to our families in a common struggle. the personal calamities that plumb 
the depth of our character.
<p>
Having prepared a comprehensive list of gifts received -- one that 
includes not only the obvious gifts. but also the ones we take for granted. 
the ones we think of as being rightfully ours. and even the ones we are 
accustomed to think of as burdens -- it remains only to determine the 
source of all these gifts and to select an appropriate response for 
communicating our appreciation. We will find that. just as the majority 
of our gifts have not come wrapped, so too have they arrived without 
labels identifying the giver. And yet. those of us who are not determined 
to be dense will readily acknowledge Who is the source. direct or indirect      
of all gifts.
<p>
But how will we show appreciation to Him? The best way is by putting 
the gifts He has given us to good use. The familiar parable of the talents 
suggests that it is not enough to reach the end of our journey merely with 
the gifts He has given us intact. We are meant to develop our aptitudes. 
invest our graces wisely!. make the most of our opportunities, and 
overcome the obstacles that confront us. That's what Thanksgiving is all 
about.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 24, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Spies Elude U.S. Security</h2></center><P>

[The John Walker spy case shocked America. How did Walker manage to 
steal so many of our county's secrets and pass them on to the Soviets for 
18 years without being detected?]
<p>
How did John Walker get away with his treacherous activities? The 
answer is simple: "The U.S. security system does not work." <p>That's the 
conclusion of George P. Morse, a security consultant with half a century 
of experience. Morse considers it likely that "American secrets are still 
being compromised in ways similar to those which John Walker found so 
easy and effective to employ, for there is really no effective U.S. 
government security system in place to stem the hemorrhaging." In a 
new book called America Twice Betrayed Morse concludes that our 
nation's security system is "unsound and unworkable and should be 
abolished and replaced."
<p>
A veteran of 30 years' service with the OSS and CIA, Morse contends 
that the apprehension of spies like Walker has resulted more often from 
luck than vigilance. "The great majority of spies and enemy agents have 
actually been uncovered by accident." he observes, "or through exposure 
by the subject's relatives or defectors from the intelligence services of 
other nations. They have not generally been uncovered by our official 
government security, investigative. or intelligence systems." In fact. says 
Morse. "the way security has traditional v been conceived and organized 
by the U.S. government makes it virtually impossible to protect our 
secrets."
<p>
In his book. America Twice Betrayed. Morse proposes a new system of 
U.S. government security to "remedy many of the failures of the past 
[and] at the same time substantiallv reduce both the monetary and 
human costs associated with security." What is needed, says Morse, is "a 
total rethinking of our basic approach to security." His first step would be 
to eliminate the "wasteful and counter-productive" full field investigation 
of all applicants for federal employment. Such an investigation "creates 
the illusion that the people investigated and then 'cleared' will always be 
loyal and honest." says Morse. "It provides a false sense of security 
which enables management and staff to avoid [their obligation to 
maintain] constant vigilance."
<p>
Instead, Morse would require the applicant "to offer proof of both 
suitability and trustworthiness and loyalty." Standard reference checks 
would be followed by an intensive interview. drug-screening. and a 
polygraph examination. "Polygraph tests -- and the fear of having to 
undergo one -- are arnong the few really effective tools available to the 
government to deter and detect treason or prevarication." Says Morse, who argues that "applicants seeking government employment and security 
clearance must, as a condition of their employment, accept reasonable 
limits of privacy and their constitutional rights against self-
incrimination."
<p>
Morse also calls for the development of "an appropriate and 
comprehensive set of standards that state concretely what is and what is 
not acceptable to qualify for a U.S. government security clearance." The 
most pressing need. however, is for a dramatic improvement in "the 
abysmal quality of management exercised by the Executive Branch from 
the President on down."

[They're convinced they can solve all the world's problems if we just do 
what they say. No matter how messed up their own lives are, no matter 
how much they disrupt the lives of others, those dauntless do-gooders 
never stop believing that they know what's best for the rest of us.]
<p>
The do-gooders jump from cause to cause, dictating solutions that betray 
ignorance of the problem at hand and total disregard for the consequences 
of their proposals. They don't seem to care whether their policies and 
practices really work or not. Why, then, do they do what they do? <p>Don't 
let their lofty rhetoric fool you. What do-gooders are really after, says 
syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution, is "ego 
gratification " By making us feel bad, they make themselves feel good.
<p>
Sowell cites many examples. "Recycling, drug education, sex education, 
animal rights, gun control, multiculturalism. environmentalism and 
innumerable other social crusades produce far more benefits to the 
crusaders than for society,. In many cases, they make society worse off," 
says Sowell. "Studies have repeatedly shown recycling does more harm 
than good, and much evidence suggests that the actual consequences of 
both drug education and sex education are nil, at best."
<p>
Do-gooders don't care if recycling causes more ecological damage than 
the original manufacturing process. They don't care if drug and sex 
education programs encourage experimentation. They don't care if gun 
control increases violence. They don't care if multiculturalism 
exacerbates racial tensions. Do-gooders don't care how things really 
work, or what the truth is. Their sole concern is to "make a statement." As 
Sowell points out. "there is no need to check out facts if the real point is 
moral preening."
<p>
Do-gooders have plagued mankind with their coercive correctives for 
hundreds of years. "In the l 9th century, housing reform in the cities was 
the big crusade," says Sowell, "especially in the slums occupied by 
recently arrived immigrants. Though many immigrants lived in crowded 
quarters in run-down neighborhoods because they had no choice, others 
doubled up and scrimped to save money to send to their families back in 
the old country. Some saved to prepare for a better future."
<p>
It's too bad that the do-gooders couldn't leave well enough alone, but it's 
in their nature to interfere. They felt compelled to save those poor souls 
from themselves. "Reformers decided that people needed more space per 
person and wrote that into laws, thereby raising the cost of housing to the 
immigrants," says Sowell. "People were forced to spend their money not 
on what their own top priorities were, but on what the anointed 
busybodies decided was best for them."
<p>
Such meddling has gone on for millennia. Sowell understands the 
syndrome and accepts it as a fact of life, observing that "the real question 
is not why some people treat public policy as exercises in ego 
gratification. The question is why the rest of us listen to them so 
gullibly."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 28, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Public Schools are a Dismal Failure</h2></center><P>
[It's time to face up to the failure of our nation's educational system. A 
Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that the only way to save the 
public schools is to privatize them.]
<p>
"Our elementary and secondary educational system needs to be radically 
reconstructed," says Nobel economist Milton Friedman of the Hoover 
Institution. The system is hopelessly defective, and the "technological 
and political revolutions of the past few decades" are only going to make 
it worse. Friedman predicts that "a widening gap between the incomes of 
the highly skilled . . . and the unskilled" will lead to "serious social 
conflict. "
<p>
Friedman points out that dramatic technological advances have "made it 
possible for a company located anywhere in the world to use resources 
located anywhere in the world, to produce a product anywhere in the 
world, to be sold anywhere in the world." Equally dramatic political 
changes in Eastern Europe and Latin America have led to the widespread 
rejection of central planning in favor of free markets and "added greatly 
to the pool of low-wage, yet not necessarily unskilled labor" with which 
U.S. workers must compete. These developments have put "downward 
pressure on the wages of low-skilled labor," widening the income gap in 
America. If this gap continues to widen, "it threatens to create within our 
own country a social problem of major proportions," warns Friedman. 
<p>"Such stratification is a recipe for social disaster." Only a dramatically 
improved school system can brighten the prospects of Americans at the 
bottom of the economic ladder.
<p>
Friedman argues that "radical reconstruction can be achieved only by 
privatizing a major segment of the educational system." To encourage "a 
gradual yet substantial transfer from government to private enterprise." 
<p>Friedman recommends "a voucher system that enables parents to choose 
freely the schools their children attend." He concedes, however, that "the 
political power of the school establishment" has been, and will continue 
to be, a major obstacle to this effort.
<p>
Central city residents suffer most from the poor quality of public 
schooling. "The reason is partly the deterioration of our central cities, 
partly the increased centralization of public schools." says Friedman. 
<p>"Power has moved from the local community to the school district to the 
state, and to the federal government. About 90 percent of our kids now go 
to so-called public schools. which are really not public at all but simply 
private fiefs primarily of the administrators and the union officials."
<p>
Friedman insists that everyone will benefit from a voucher system, 
"except a small group of vested interests." The big winners will be "the 
residents of central cities, who will have a real alternative to the wretched 
schools so many of their children are now forced to attend." That "small 
group of vested interests" has tremendous clout, however. <p>"The teachers' 
unions are bitterly opposed to any reform that lessens their own power," 
says Friedman, "and they have acquired enormous political and financial 
strength." They won't hesitate to use that strength to defeat "any attempt 
to adopt a voucher system."

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  LEGALIZED GAMBLING DESTROYING COMMUNITIES</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 29, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legalized Gambling Destroying Communities</h2></center><P> 
 
[The social and economic havoc that legalized gambling is wreaking on  
communities throughout our country could have been avoided, if only  
Americans had learned the lessons of history.]  
  <p>
"On the whole, legalization of gambling in the United States has failed  
completely. Instead of eliminating abuses, it increased them . . .  
legalization attracted criminals." That's the conclusion of Virgil Peterson,  
onetime director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Mr. Peterson made  
those remarks in the 1950s, but they're even more appropriate today, now  
that state lotteries and gambling casinos have sprouted up all over the  
country.  
  <p>
"Commercialized vice and gambling have always been the principal  
props of the underworld," said Peterson, more than 40 years ago. "The  
intrinsic character of gambling naturally attracts the criminal element.  <p>
The kidnapper, the armed robber, the burglar, and the thief engage in  
their criminal enterprises for the purpose of obtaining money without  
working. Gambling establishments appeal to this type of individual."  
  <p>
In 1956 a New Orleans newspaper published a series of editorials  
reminding its readers of the many social ills that inevitably result when  
commercial gamblers are allowed to gain a foothold in a community.  
New Orleanians should have known better. After all, the city had had a  
long history of legal and illegal gambling and the dire consequences were  
a matter of public record. "Those who cannot remember the past are  
condemned to repeat it," said the philosopher George Santayana, and he  
might have added that there are always sharpies in the shadows waiting to  
cash in on our short memories.  
  <p>
The editorial writer for the New Orleans paper argued that "commercial  
gambling breeds official and political corruption. It is the incubator of the  
racketeer and the gangster." How do gambling interests gain a foothold?   <p>
What happened more than 40 years ago in Phenix City, Alabama typifies  
their methods: "The gamblers moved in, with the sanction of some  
officials. The bribe money looked good to them. They let more gamblers  
in. But the gambling profits looked even better. They moved in with the  
gamblers." Greed knows no limits, however. "Big, easy profits make big  
spenders. Big spenders seek bigger profits, and, eventually, some  
insurance that their profits will continue." Wherever the professional  
gambler operates, "he amasses a huge fortune which he eventually uses to  
influence government so as to insure not only his continued prosperity  
but an even greater one."  
  <p>
The newspaper warned that "the crime that gambling breeds is not  
confined to the professional gamblers. Infected also are hopeless  
gamblers. Like the dope addict, the gambling addict finds his fleeting  
thrills expensive. Money earned through lawful means rarely can support  
his pleasures. He turns to crime, to stickups, to burglary, to  
embezzlement, to white slavery, even to murder, for the fast buck that he  
needs to indulge himself."  
  <p>
Today's racketeers may have MBAs and designer suits, but they're still  
racketeers, and their activities are sucking the lifeblood out of our local  
economies and breeding vice. How much damage will they have to do  
before we send them packing?

Duplantier</a> <br>November 30, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>PC on Campus Hinders Pursuit of Truth</h2></center><P>
[The search for truth is getting to be a risky business.  Just ask any  
college student who's run afoul of the thought police on campus.]   
  <p>
There's no longer any use in denying it. The temples of learning have   
become indoctrination centers. Academic freedom has given way to mass   
hysteria. A bizarre misanthropic cult now reigns supreme on American   
college campuses. "Political correctness has been used to enforce   
conformity and to stifle debate," say Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann of the   
Hoover Institution. "Censorship is practiced in a variety of ways. through   
the planned disruption of meetings, the use of so-called speech codes, and   
the coercive use of sensitivity training or suspension from school.   
<p>Indirect censorship is also practiced through the selection of assigned   
reading and also through hiring practices."  
  <p>
The puppets of political correctness reject the European focus of   
American history, ignoring the fact that "the United States is, for the   
greater part, a demographic and cultural extension of Europe beyond the   
Atlantic. About four-fifths of the US population derives from European   
stock," say Duignan and Gann. "The United States owes a cultural debt to   
almost every land under the sun," they concede. "But no other country   
influenced the United States as much as Great Britain." Our language, our   
literature, our legal system, our system of government, our ethical system   
-- all have British origins.   
  <p>
The PC crowd insists on a growing array of ethnic studies programs to   
remedy the alleged racial bias of Western scholarship. They're unwilling   
to accept the fact that the United States is a product of Western   
civilization. with pronounced European characteristics -- characteristics   
that include a unique appreciation for cultures other than its own. <p>"Far   
from being one of the world's most oppressive societies, the United States   
is the most successful multiracial and multiethnic state in existence," say   
Duignan and Gann. "No other country attracts as many immigrants and   
bestows its citizenship on so many newcomers. No other country is   
ethnically more varied."  
  <p>
Purveyors of political correctness claim that the West has had a uniformly   
negative impact on lesser developed countries. On the contrary.   
"mainland has gained in the long run by the Western conquest of the New   
World and by the consequent emergence of new nations," say Duignan   
and Gann. "Modern industrial civilization allows not only higher   
economic productivity! than its early predecessors but also an infinitely   
larger population and higher material well-being and a longer life," not to   
mention "an infinitely larger number of choices."  
  <p>
In their eagerness to condemn the United States as a racist and sexist   
society. the PC partisans willingly ignore the numerous alternative   
explanations for economic inequities -- such as the median age of ethnic   
groups. cultural and genetic differences. and so on. They also maintain   
that America is not the free country we have all been "brainwashed" to   
believe it is. That they themselves are the ones who have been   
brainwashed. that the PC movement itself threatens the liberties of all   
Americans -- such ironies are lost on this humorless horde.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 1, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>NAFTA Bad for American Workers</h2></center><P>

[It is estimated that nearly one million Americans lost their jobs this year 
as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as 
NAFTA). How many more American workers will have to suffer the 
same fate before our leaders admit they made a mistake?] 
 <p>
NAFTA has taken a terrible toll on the American economy, and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as GATT) will only 
make matters worse, says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. Gill points out that "the United States is currently 
running record trade deficits with Mexico, after years of chalking up 
trade surpluses against that country." Of even greater concern is "the 
continued migration of our industrial plants to Mexico, which every day 
robs us of more jobs." An estimated one million jobs will have been lost 
by the end of this year. In spite of their rosy, pre-NAFTA predictions, 
giant American companies like Mattel, Allied Signal, General Electric. 
Procter & Gamble, Scott Paper, and Zenith have failed to create the 
thousands of new jobs in the United States that they promised. Instead, 
they have laid off American workers. 
 <p>
NAFTA hasn't done Mexico and Canada any good either, says Gill. "In 
Mexico, hundreds of thousands of poor farmers are being driven off the 
land and the middle class is collapsing under interest rates which in some 
cases are well over 100 percent. Conditions have become so bad in 
Canada that several western provinces . . . are threatening to secede." Gill 
says that Mexico is in "a state of chaos since NAFTA." Drug trafficking 
is on the rise, crime is burgeoning, farmers are in revolt. "The collapse of 
the peso drove hundreds of small businessmen into bankruptcy," says 
Gill.  "The job losses have been tremendous, in spite of the growth of 
exports to the U.S." Nearly 60 percent of the Mexican workforce is 
unemployed. 
 <p>
As Mexico's internal problems worsen, they pose a growing threat to the 
health and security of the United States. "Even before NAFTA, Mexico 
was the principal conduit for cocaine coming into the U.S. from 
Columbia and other Latin American countries," and the volume has 
increased substantially ever since. "Crime, rampant in Mexico for 
decades, has spilled across the border like a tidal wave in the last two 
years." 
 <p>
William Gill contends that "the American people, like the Mexicans and 
Canadians, have all been made the victims of a gigantic fraud -- the 
biggest scam in history." He argues that there is "only one way to halt the 
insanity  NAFTA and GATT are spreading across America and around 
the world. And that is to roll back both of these fraudulent treaties." Gill 
insists that "NAFTA must be abrogated. America and Mexico cannot 
keep on absorbing the terrible punishment this treaty has inflicted upon 
the people of both countries." 
 <p>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, is filing 
several legal challenges to NAFTA and GATT and the $53 billion bailout 
of Mexico. The Coalition wants to block the implementation of these 
treaties before they cause any more damage to our sovereignty and to our 
economy.

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  ANTI-RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY RAMPANT IN HOLLYWOOD</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>December 4, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-religious Bigotry Rampant in Hollywood</h2></center><P>
[A new documentary offers numerous examples of the anti-religious 
bigotry that is rampant in Hollywood.] 
 <p>
"For years now, the entertainment industry has attacked our faith and 
undermined our value system," observes Dr. James Dobson of Focus on 
the Family, in his introduction to a new documentary entitled Hollywood 
vs. Religion. "The entire Judeo-Christian tradition is ridiculed." The 
hour-long video tape is narrated by Michael Medved, New York Post 
film critic and co-host of the PBS program called Sneak Previews.  He 
examines more than 50 contemporary films that lampoon the religious 
beliefs of the American people. Unfortunately, this is just a sampling.  <p>
"There are a great many other movies that also mock our faith," says 
Dobson. 
 <p>
According to Medved, Hollywood's hostility toward religion is a fairly 
recent development. Showing heartwarming scenes of Spencer Tracy in 
Boys Town, Bing Crosby in The Bells of St. Mary's, and Julie Andrews 
in The Sound of Music.  Medved notes that "this tradition of taking a 
positive view of the clergy and the faithful continued well into the l960s." <p>
But the film world has lost its fondness for the faith.  "Today, by contrast, 
moviemakers will stretch to insert images of vicious clergymen or crazed 
killer Christians,'' says Medved.  They'll even go so far as to introduce 
vicious stereotypes into remakes of old films -- such as The Blob and 
Cape Fear -- where none existed before. 
 <p>
What are the stereotypes? Here's how Hollywood views the world of 
religion: "The Catholic Church is linked to the Mafia. Evangelical 
believers are suckers and dupes. In their hearts, many Christians want to 
take over the country and establish a dictatorship. Orthodox Jews are 
hypocrites.  Agnostics, on the other hand, are wise, wonderful people." <p>
Hollywood will bend over backwards not to offend the fringe elements of 
society, but the cherished beliefs of the vast majority of Americans are 
fair game. "Only the sensibilities of mainstream Western religious groups 
are repeatedly ignored." says Medved. "And many films send the 
unmistakable message that higher truth can only be found outside the 
teaching of all organized faith." 
 <p>
Everything in Hollywood is carefully calculated, says Medved, and that 
includes the anti-religious imagery that we are seeing more and more of: 
"It's no accident when filmmakers show us so many villains who happen 
to be religious," he observes.  Why do they do it?  Directors and 
producers like to claim that they're only giving the public what it wants, 
but the box-office failure of such offensive movies as The Last 
Temptation of Christ puts the lie to this claim. More than three dozen 
films featuring repugnant religious stereotypes have come out of 
Hollywood in recent years. "Almost all of these movies ended up losing 
money," says Medved. The real reason that such films continue to be 
made is that they reflect the mindset of a "tightly knit community whose 
members happen to share some similar, unspoken values and biases. And 
one of those biases involves sincere and deep-seated contempt for 
organized religion."

Duplantier</a> <br>December 5, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legal Redistribution of Wealth Unjust</h2></center><P>
[Our legal system can be just, or it can be philanthropic, but it cannot be 
both.] 
 <p>
"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among 
all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties 
and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be 
. . . uninterrupted," observed the l9th Century French economist Frederic 
Bastiat in a small book titled "The Law," published in 1850. "But there is 
also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, 
they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others." 
 <p>
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder." No matter how noble the 
justification, once the premise is accepted that a government can 
expropriate the wealth of some of its citizens and dispense it to others, 
theft has been legalized, and the signal has been sent -- to haves and 
havenots alike -- that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the 
greatest evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as 
the ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders. The ill effects of 
such a transformation are predictable. When the law ceases to be just, 
respect for it diminishes, and society suffers.  "The safest way to make 
laws respected is to make them respectable," said Bastiat. "When law and 
morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of 
either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law." 
 <p>
Bastiat argued that "the most peaceful, the most moral, and the happiest 
people" in the world are to be found in "countries where the law least 
interferes with private affairs; where government is least felt; where the 
individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest influence; 
where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where taxes are 
lightest...." Their bliss shall continue only so long as each citizen 
remembers that "the existence of persons and property preceded the 
existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guarantee their 
safety." 
 <p>
Inevitably, though, there will be some who think they are better than the 
rest of us. "Too many persons place themselves above mankind," said 
Bastiat; "they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, and ruling it." <p>
But mankind does not need their help. "God has given to men all that is 
necessary for them to accomplish their destinies." Bastiat had no use for 
"quacks and organizers . . . with their artificial systems!" He denounced 
"the whims of governmental administrators, their socialized projects, 
their centralization, their tariffs, their government schools, their state 
religions, their free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their 
restrictions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious moralizations!" 
 <p>
Bastiat's challenge to the do-gooders bears frequent repetition: "You who 
think that you are so great! You who judge humanity to be so small! You 
who wish to reform everything! Why don't you reform yourselves?"

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  SOCIALISM'S CONTINUING APPEAL
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>December 6, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Socialism's Continuing Appeal</h2></center><P>
[Socialism makes no economic or intellectual sense. How, then, do we 
explain its continuing appeal?] 
 <p>
"Thanks to its promise of regeneration, thanks to the hope it flashes 
before all the disinherited of life, socialism is becoming a belief of a 
religious character rather than a doctrine." Thus concluded French social 
psychologist Gustave Le Bon in a book entitled "The Psychology of 
Socialism," published at the turn of the last century. The dream of 
socialism is "to substitute itself for the ancient faiths," said Le Bon. It 
seeks to do so by appealing to "the sentiments of envy and hatred which 
it creates in the hearts of the multitudes. To the crowd, no longer satisfied 
with political and civic equality, it proposes equality of condition." 
 <p>
Socialism is a form of collective fatigue, a kind of mass despair. 
Energetic peoples have no use for it. Thriving cultures are characterized 
by "a considerable extension of what is confided to personal initiative, 
and a progressive reduction of all that is left to the state to perform." In 
worn-out cultures, that is, cultures on the decline, "the government is 
always a power absorbing everything, manufacturing everything, and 
controlling the smallest details of the citizen's life." 
 <p>
Le Bon argued that all forms of  government enshrine one or the other of 
"two different and opposing fundamental principles -- individualism and 
collectivism. By individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is 
carried to a maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism 
a man's least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses 
no initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results. "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization," he said, "and 
today dominate the world." 
 <p>
Socialism has no appeal for a vigorous, self-confident people. It begins to 
gain ground, however, when the middle and upper classes lose their 
moorings, when they are "no longer sure of their rights. Or rather, they 
are not sure of anything, and they do not know how to defend anything." <p>
Once they succumb to what Le Bon called a "vague humanitarianism," 
their days as free men are numbered. "Under the unconscious but 
disintegrating influence of this humanitarianism, the directing classes 
[lose] all confidence in the justice of their cause. They surrender more 
and more to the leaders of the opposing party, who merely despise them 
in proportion to their concessions." 
 <p>
To avert the triumph of socialism, Le Bon counseled his countrymen to 
"give up our perpetual prospects of reform, and also the idea that we must 
always be changing our constitutions, our institutions, and our laws. 
Above all we ought to limit, and not constantly extend, the intervention 
of the state, so as to force the citizens to acquire a little of the initiative 
and the habit of self-government" of which they have been deprived by 
pandering and paternalistic programs.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 7, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Political Chaos and the Decay of Language</h2></center><P> 
[British writer George Orwell is best remembered for the novels 1984 and 
Animal Farm, two of the most prophetic satires about 20th Century 
socialism ever written. But Orwell was also a prolific journalist and 
essayist. A short piece he wrote entitled "Politics and the English 
Language" should be required reading for anyone who wants to explore 
the connection between degraded language and political tyranny.] 
 <p>
The quality of our language and the quality of our thought are 
inextricably linked. Our language "becomes ugly and inaccurate because 
our thoughts are foolish," said George Orwell, "but the slovenliness of 
our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts." Orwell was 
convinced that we could improve the quality of our language and the 
quality of our thought if we would just pay more attention to what we say 
and write. "Modern English," he said, "is full of bad habits which spread 
by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the 
necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits, one can think more 
clearly, and to think more clearly is a necessary first step toward political 
regeneration." 
 <p>
Among the bad linguistic habits Orwell identified are worn-out 
metaphors, pretentious diction, and meaningless words. Many metaphors 
"have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save 
people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves." Who today can 
even recall what it originally meant to "toe the line" or "ride roughshod 
over"?  Pretentious diction, particularly the use of polysyllabic words of 
foreign derivation, is a nasty habit favored by "scientific, political and 
sociological writers" who are "haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek 
words are grander than Saxon ones." The worst habit of all is to use 
language, our tool of communication, in such a way as to communicate 
nothing.  "In certain kinds of writing, " said Orwell, "particularly in art 
criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages 
which are almost completely lacking in meaning." 
 <p>
Orwell observed that "modern writing at its worst does not consist in 
picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in 
order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long 
strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else. <p> 
"This allows us to avoid the difficult task of thinking.  If we get out of the 
habit of thinking, however, we become susceptible to all sorts of 
foolishness. 
 <p>
Political writing nowadays is invariably "bad writing," said Orwell, 
because it is used primarily for the "defense of the indefensible." 
Euphemism, evasion, and vagueness are its main characteristics. Every 
conscientious citizen must be in the habit of thinking, and pay close 
attention, if he is to avoid being victimized by the obfuscations of 
demagogues. Orwell encouraged all true patriots to "recognize that the 
present political chaos is connected with the decay of language."  He 
urged us to defend our liberties by defending our language.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 8, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Communists Still A Threat</h2></center><P> 
[Dramatic reforms in the once-captive nations of Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union signaled the end of the Cold War and ushered in an era of 
peace, right?  Not necessarily.  One former KGB agent says the whole 
thing's a charade -- part of a long-range Soviet strategy to conquer the 
West without firing a shot!]
<p>
Anatoliy Golitsyn was a KGB agent for 16 years prior to his defection to  
the United States in 1961. In 1984 he published a book called New Lies  
for Old in which he predicted unprecedented economic and political  
reforms behind the Iron Curtain. the legalization of Solidarity in Poland.  
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. His predictions were ignored or dismissed  
at the time, but all soon came to pass. Westerners were astounded by the  
turn of events, and in the euphoria that followed the significance of  
Golitsyn's predictions was lost. 
 <p>
But Golitsyn is sounding the alarm again. He's just published a new book  
called The Perestroika Deception in which he repeats the warnings he  
issued more than 10 years ago. Golitsyn says the purpose of perestroika is  
twofold: to elicit Western financial support for the revitalization of the  
socialist economies, and to facilitate the convergence of East and West.  <p>
The ultimate aim is "peaceful conquest of the United States and Western  
Europe from within." 
 <p>
The Communists have gone to great lengths to recreate the trappings of  
Western democracy, with opposition parties and free elections. But they  
are just imitations of the real thing. "Even so-called 'free' elections do not  
pose a problem for the Communist parties. Because of their secret  
partnership with the 'opposition.' the Communist Parties are invariably in  
a winning position. It is their candidates -- whether Communist or 'non- 
Communist' -- who always win, since all the non-Communist candidates  
and 'parties' are controlled," says Golitsyn. "The Communists have  
succeeded in concealing from the West that the 'non-Communist' parties  
are secret partners of the Communists, not alternatives or rivals to them." 
 <p>
The same thing goes for the so-called independent Republics. "The  
present Communist strategists are concealing that it is they who are now  
creating 'independent' Republics." says Golitsyn. "The strategists are  
concealing the secret coordination that exists, and will continue to exist,  
between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of these newly 'independent'  
Republics." He says the apparently fragmented Soviet Empire can be

Perestroika represents "a broad strategic assault on the Western mindset,"  
an assault that gives every indication of achieving spectacular success.  <p>
"The meaning of developments in the (formerly) Communist world is  
misunderstood," says Golitsyn, "and the intentions behind Communist  
initiatives have been misinterpreted. Enemies are accepted and treated as  
though they have suddenly overnight. become allies of the West."  
Golitsyn confesses himself saddened by "the contemporary jubilation of  
American and West European conservatives who are cheering  
'perestroika' without realizing that it is intended to bring about their own  
political and even physical demise."

<h2>Real Men</h2></center><P> 
[Remember the good old days when men were the towers of strength and 
faithfulness we expected them to be?]
<P>
Tens of thousands of American males are trying to rediscover what it 
really means to be a man, and thousands of American women are rooting 
for them. Syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams reports that a group 
called Promise Keepers is "attracting men of all backgrounds to publicly 
declare their faith in God and acceptance of responsibility for leadership 
in their families and communities." Promise Keepers have filled football 
stadiums to demonstrate their determination to keep their marriage 
promises. What's behind it? Why is it happening now? Williams believes 
that, after three decades of experimentation it's become indisputably 
clear that the deconstruction of traditional gender roles by the feminist 
and the playboy movements has failed.
<P>
"After more than a quarter-century that saw the rise of feminism, gay 
rights, and societal approval of a variety of so-called 'alternative 
lifestyles,' we have come almost full circle," says Williams. "The results 
of our cultural experimentation -- high divorce and illegitimacy rates, 
rising crime and violence -- have forced us to take a second look. 
Perhaps the traditional male role as a leader of the family and 
community, should be restored."
<P>
There's little doubt about that, of course. The big question is, How many 
young American males can even remember what it means to be a real 
man? Not many, concludes Williams, who offers a refresher course. 
Being a real man means respecting "the institution of marriage" and 
being responsible for the children that you bring into the world. It means 
scrupulosity in word and deed. "A real man has no need for profanity 
[and] does not engage in public disorderliness or drunkenness. A real 
man accepts responsibility for his actions; he does not make excuses for 
his mistakes or failures. He learns from them and improves himself to 
ensure that they do not happen again."
<P>
A real man is always conscious of the impression he makes, knowing 
that he is "an example and role model for his own children and the 
children in his neighborhood." He is honest, bold, and resolute. "That 
means making a decision consistent with your principles and sticking to 
it," says Williams. "A real man knows that showing love is not a 
weakness, but a strength." He understands the difference between men 
and women, accepts it, celebrates it. At the risk of being denounced for 
his gallantry, he holds doors open for women and gives up his seat on 
the bus for them.
<P>
A man must have "integrity," says Armstrong Williams, and that means 
"holding on to your principles regardless of the circumstances." A lot of 
men need these lessons in manhood, Armstrong says, because Americans 
"have forgotten where we came from and so we don't know where we're 
going. Only by remembering how things once were will we be able to 
begin working to restore civility and virtue to our chaotic society." Three 
cheers for the Promise Keepers!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Global Taxes</h2></center><P> 

[The fat cats at the United Nations are tired of having to rely on the 
generosity of member countries. They now want to bypass these 
sovereign governments and tax the people of the world directly!]
<P>
The calls for a global tax to finance the operations of the United Nations 
seem to be coming from all quarters. The so-called Independent 
Commission on Population and Quality of Life argues that the United 
Nations should be able to tax aviation traffic and freight, aviation fuel, 
ocean freight and cruises, telecommunications frequencies, 
communications satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods 
and services. At the UN World Summit for Social Development, held in 
Copenhagen earlier this year, Clinton appointee James Speth, head of 
the UN Development Program, proposed a global tax on speculative 
movements of international funds, the consumption of non-renewable 
energy, environmental permits, and the arms trade. The Clinton 
Administration is pushing for ratification of the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, which would set up an International Seabed Authority to 
collect fees and royalties imposed on American mining firms.
<P>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. Tobin predicts that "the 
revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year." Needless to say, 
UN bureaucrats are enthusiastic about the possibilities of this new 
"Tobin tax."
<P>
The Commission on Global Governance argues that "it is time for a 
consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global 
neighborhood." The Commission, which is supported by government and 
foundation funding, calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. The Commission claims that "the idea of safeguarding and 
managing the global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted."
<P>
The Worldwatch Institute calls for a global tax to finance "the transition 
to a sustainable society -- including environmental programs, social 
initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." The Oxfam Poverty Report 
proclaims that "international aid should be seen as a financial 
entitlement, and as part of a compact between citizens in the industrial 
and developing worlds." The Ford Foundation wants the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. This 
"levy on the utilization of the global commons" would allow the UN to 
put the squeeze on American taxpayers without going through our 
Congress. The World Federalist Association, headed by former 
presidential candidate John Anderson, recommends UN taxes on 
international travel and postal service.
<P>
The United Nations has no right or authority whatsoever to tax people, 
businesses, or transactions, but that won't stop the UN's greedy 
international bureaucrats from trying to usurp such authority. Too much 
of our country's wealth has already been squandered on this subversive 
organization with the cooperation of American leaders. Imagine how the 
UN will bleed us dry when it has its own taxing power and no longer 
needs to ask for our cooperation!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Bilingual Ed.</h2></center><P> 
[Bilingual education is a bureaucratic boondoggle that is isolating 
immigrant children from the rest of American society and relegating 
them to a life of second-class citizenship.]
<P>
Federal bureaucrats forced bilingual education programs into the public 
schools in 1974 without any research whatsoever to demonstrate their 
effectiveness. Twenty years later, there's still no proof that these 
programs bring immigrant children into the English-speaking 
mainstream of our nation. Prior to 1974, millions of immigrants learned 
English by the immersion method. That means that immigrant children 
went to public schools where only English was spoken and learned this 
new language rapidly. They then went home and taught English to their 
parents.
<P>
Since 1974, federal regulations have required that public school 
instructors be proficient in the foreign language they teach, but do not 
require that they speak English fluently. A school can lose its federal 
funding if it fails to "instruct," "maintain," and "develop" in the student's 
native tongue, but there is no corresponding penalty for failing to teach 
English. Unfortunately, foreign language instructors have discovered 
that they can enhance their job security by delaying their students' 
transition to English. As a result, many of their students graduate from 
public high schools without ever learning English. 
<P>
Representative Toby Roth of Wisconsin has introduced a bill in Congress 
mandating that all federal government business be conducted in English 
and repealing statutes that require non-English ballots and bilingual 
education. "In many places in America, English is no longer the first 
language in school," says Roth. "Our children are now taught, by law 
and with government funds, in dozens of languages other than English -- 
12 different languages in New York City alone. Instead of a first-rate 
education in English. students in bilingual education classes are taught 
in their native tongue, and English is rarely spoken."
<P>
Toby Roth argues that, despite the enormous expense involved (an 
estimated $8 billion annually), "bilingual education is a dismal failure at 
doing what Congress originally asked it to do: teach children English 
quickly and effectively. Tragically, it relegates countless children -- 
unable to speak, understand, and use English effectively -- to a second-
class future. More important, programs like bilingual education divide 
our country by undermining the common bond that holds our country 
together -- our English language."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that the purpose of his legislation is simply to 
ensure that "the primary language of instruction in schools is English, 
and that [Americans] vote and deal with the government in English. 
People will still be able, even encouraged, to speak and learn a foreign 
language, and preserve their heritage," he insists. "The only significant 
difference will be that government actively reinforces our common 
language rather than erodes it."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that his overriding goal is "to keep America one 
nation, one people. We must preserve the common bond that has kept 
this country of immigrants together for more than two centuries by 
making English our official language. Our future as a united nation 
depends on it."

<h2>Truth in Learning</h2></center><P>                

[The failure of our educational system -- especially our colleges and 
universities -- can be traced, ultimately, to one human flaw, arrogance.]
<P>
The tremendous popularity of the television quiz show called Wheel of 
Fortune no doubt derives from the program's ingenious design, which 
encourages contestants to delay solution of the puzzle while racking up 
points for guessing the letters that compose it. Home viewers are thereby 
assured of knowing the answer long before it is officially acknowledged. 
What keeps Wheel of Fortune fans coming back is the pleasant feeling of 
superiority home viewers enjoy each time the answer is revealed, and 
they find out it's just what they thought it was.
<P>
A similar predictability may have accounted for the tremendous 
popularity of one of the best-selling books of the 1980s, Allan Bloom's 
The Closing of the American Mind. That's the book that started an 
impressive genre of writing critical of colleges and universities. After all, 
Allan Bloom didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know. We'd 
known for years that the colleges are filled with leftist and relativistic 
ideologues. We didn't need to spend $20 on a 400-page book to find that 
out, but many of us did, and were gratified that a university professor 
had finally said what we'd been saying all along.
<P>
A lesser-known scholar named James Schall also set out to expose the 
intellectual blight in our nation's universities. His book, entitled 
Another Sort of Learning, appeared almost simultaneously with the 
paperback  release of The Closing of the American Mind, but it did not 
enjoy similar success. Here's why: Rather than make us feel superior, 
even a bit smug, by confirming our bleak assessments of contemporary 
education, Schall's book made us feel uneasy. Schall insisted, for 
instance, that "most of the important things we do not in fact learn are 
not learned because we choose not to learn them." In other words, we 
expect too much from the universities, and we've only got ourselves to 
blame for our manifest deficiencies.
<P>
Schall went even further. He suggested that a university is "not really 
equipped" to provide the education we need. He said that the university 
is "designed, consciously or unconsciously, to prevent us from 
confronting in our own lives the ultimate questions of existence and 
essence." Needless to say, Schall's radical ideas didn't go over big in 
college towns. After all, it's one thing to say that the system isn't 
working: it's another thing entirely to say it isn't meant to work. But 
that's what Schall said, emphasizing that "we meet the more ultimate 
things in our churches, in our families, in our living, in our friendships."
<P>
Schall wasn't satisfied with condemning relativism. He had to talk about 
Truth. Allan Bloom had discussed Truth too, but somehow, in Schall's 
book, Truth seemed to mean something specific. Unlike Bloom, Schall 
dared to identify the source of Truth, and to declare that revelation 
makes it available to everyone, the humbler the better. James Schall's 
book, Another Sort of Learning, addresses the first causes of the 
decline of college campuses today.

<h2>Pugwash Brainwash</h2></center><P> 

[This year's Nobel Peace Prize speaks volumes about the dubious politics 
of the Nobel Committee.]
<P>
This year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Pugwash Conferences 
on Science and World Affairs, a long-inactive organization, and to one 
of its last remaining members, 86-year-old Polish-born Joseph Rotblat. 
Few Americans under the age of 50 even remember the Pugwash 
Conferences or have any idea who Joseph Rotblat is. They're not likely to 
understand the significance of this year's Peace Prize, or to realize what 
a travesty it is.
<P>
The Pugwash Conferences took their name from the location of the first 
conference, held in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the home of the 
organization's chief financial backer, multi-millionaire U.S. industrialist 
Cyrus Eaton. Eaton and other Pugwash members, such as British 
philosopher Bertrand Russell, were ardent socialists who sought, under 
the guise of scientific objectivity, to influence world affairs to the 
advantage of the Soviet Union and to the detriment of the United States.
<P>
The most important Pugwash Conference took place in Moscow in 1960. 
Among the more prominent U.S. scientists attending were Jerome 
Wiesner and Walt Rostow, who shortly after their return became leading 
policy planners in the next administration of President John F. Kennedy. 
At that Moscow conference, Wiesner outlined a comprehensive program 
for nuclear disarmament and for transferring our nation's military 
strength to an international agency. Rostow also addressed the 
conference, recommending a nuclear test ban treaty .
<P>
Rostow was well placed in the Kennedy Administration to promote this 
objective. In 1963, President Kennedy sent Averell Harriman to Moscow 
to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, thereby perpetuating the 
tremendous advantage that the Soviets had gained from a recent series of 
giant nuclear tests. Rostow and his fellow Pugwash members were 
criticized for jeopardizing U.S. security with this treaty, but they 
continued to insist that "nuclear parity will promote peace." They 
argued, absurdly, that abandoning America's nuclear advantage in favor 
of equality between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would make the Soviet 
Union feel more secure and thereby less likely to resort to war!
<P>
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who served in both the Kennedy 
and the Johnson Administrations, made "parity" a cornerstone of his 
strategy to abandon our strategic superiority. He argued that "nuclear 
parity" would give the world "a more stable balance of terror." It had, in 
fact, the very opposite effect, emboldening the Soviet Union to extend its 
evil empire, secure in the knowledge that the United States could no 
longer risk a nuclear showdown. The Soviets maintained their aggressive 
military posture until President Reagan rebuilt our military strength and 
demonstrated his determination to follow through on building the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. Unable to keep pace with our procurement, 
the evil empire self-destructed. In awarding this year's Peace Prize to the 
Pugwash Conferences, the Nobel Committee makes abundantly clear that 
its idea of "peace" is really pacifism.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[The most important section of the Republicans' Medicare reform bill is 
Medical Savings Accounts.]
<P>
It is the inclusion of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs) that 
makes the Republican Medicare bill a genuine, free-market-oriented 
reform. Without them, according to Peter Ferrara of Americans for Tax 
Reform, the Medicare plan could not be supported "by anyone who 
opposed the Clinton health plan last year." Ferrara argues that MSAs 
will allow "market incentives and competition [to] control costs 
consistent with patient preferences." Without MSAs, "the Medicare 
reform would only meet the budget targets through the same heavy-
handed rationing mechanisms included in the Clinton plan last year."
<P>
All fall, there has been tremendous pressure from the media and the 
liberal establishment to drop MSAs from the Medicare package, but that 
would be a tremendous mistake and jeopardize the future of Americans 
in their golden years. According to policy analyst Peter Ferrara, 
"reimbursements to doctors and hospitals would be cut so much that 
many would refuse to treat Medicare patients. In particular, the elderly 
would no longer have access to the latest, most advanced, most 
sophisticated care. They would suffer with essentially the same low-
quality care as imposed on Medicaid patients today." Or they would be 
shunted off into health maintenance organizations, "where they would 
have to give up control over their health care to a third-party 
bureaucracy."
<P>
Who gets control -- "each individual patient, or the government and its 
designated rationing bodies" -- is the central issue in health care reform. 
"MSAs give power to the people. Without MSAs, the Medicare reform 
plan would only take control over their health care away from retirees."
<P>
According to Ferrara, Medical Savings Accounts "provide complete 
catastrophic coverage for all expenses over the deductible in the plan. 
Medicare does not provide such coverage." MSAs put a reasonable cap 
on "out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly." Medicare, by contrast, has 
no cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Retirees can be liable for tens of 
thousands in expenses each year under the program, says Ferrara. "That 
is why 70 percent of the elderly buy private supplemental insurance to 
cover those gaps." MSAs can be used to "pay for health expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs." MSAs also "allow 
broader freedom of choice of doctors and services than Medicare." As it 
stands now, many doctors refuse to treat Medicare patients because 
Medicare "underpays health providers so substantially." Ferrara says 
"that problem will only get worse in the future."
<P>
Widespread use of Medical Savings Accounts would reduce health care 
spending dramatically. Health care costs would be reduced by as much as 
30 percent if all Americans switched from traditional third-party 
insurance to Medical Savings Accounts. Those opposed to MSAs use 
false budget estimates, claiming that MSAs would increase Medicare 
spending. But Peter Ferrara insists that "MSAs do not increase out-of-
pocket costs for the sick. They reduce them," and, in fact, are better than 
what Medicare gives seniors now.

<h2>Aristotle on Democracy</h2></center><P> 

[The Greek philosopher Aristotle analyzed the benefits and 
disadvantages of various forms of government. His comments on the 
nature of democracies are especially valuable to Americans.]
<P>
Aristotle believed that communities are established when men are 
"drawn together by a common interest," each attaining "a share in good 
life." This good life is "the chief end, both for the community as a whole 
and for each of us individually." Aristotle argued that monarchies, 
aristocracies, and democracies can all be acceptable to the citizens of a 
country if their constitutions are just: "Those constitutions which 
consider the common interest are right constitutions," said Aristotle. 
"Those constitutions which consider only the personal interest of the 
rulers are all wrong constitutions, or perversions of the right forms."
<P>
Justice demands that a nation's rulers -- whatever their number -- be 
bound by law. Men have a right to expect impartiality when they sue for 
justice. For this they need "a neutral authority; and law is a neutral 
authority." The sovereignty of the law must supersede the sovereignty of 
the ruler. The law is a higher authority than the ruler because it proceeds 
from a higher authority. "He who commands that law should rule 
[commands] that God and reason alone should rule," said Aristotle: "he 
who commands that a man should rule adds the character of the beast."
<P>
Democracies inevitably decline when they cease to respect this higher 
authority and place the interests of any one group above the common 
good. In so doing, they ultimately destroy their middle classes. Without 
those middle classes, or "golden mean." democracies are left with 
"people who are ignorant how to rule and only know how to obey, as if 
they were so many slaves, and, on the other hand, people who are 
ignorant how to obey any sort of authority and only know how to rule as 
if they were masters of slaves." Clashes between the envious and the 
contemptuous will soon level such a state. "Nothing could be further 
removed from the spirit of friendship or the temper of a political 
community," warned Aristotle. "Community depends upon friendship."
<P>
The continued existence of a substantial middle class in America is vital 
to the preservation of our form of government. Every assault upon the 
middle class threatens to undermine the integrity of that government. 
The most obvious assault upon the middle class is our confiscatory 
income tax. The progressive income tax was one of Karl Marx's goals, 
and he supported it specifically to impoverish the middle class, thereby 
polarizing society and promoting class warfare. If we are to retain our 
freedom, we must protect this beleaguered middle class from further 
encroachment. Efforts to restore our constitutional government would be 
greatly facilitated by a swelling of the middle class. We are indebted to 
Aristotle for his exposition of the crucial role that the middle class plays 
in safeguarding freedom and a just society.

<h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2></center><P> 

[Along with our lives, the promise of salvation and the means through 
Christ are undoubtedly the greatest gifts ever bestowed on mankind.]
<P>
Inspiration and a close examination of God's plan in nature enabled pre-
Christian Greek and Roman philosophers to formulate reasonably 
effective systems for right living and right government. Yet God himself, 
the acknowledged source of all true law, saw fit to promulgate His codes 
more directly. First He gave us His Ten Commandments through Moses, 
and then He sent His only Son to reaffirm those commandments and to 
offer us two central laws under which those commandments were 
subsumed: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great 
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself."
<P>
In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ made clear that we must obey the 
spirit of God's law and not merely the letter. Surely this is a fantastic 
vision of utopia a world in which men love their enemies and forgive 
them every trespass: in which they do not swear, do not look on women 
lustfully, and do not seek revenge; do their alms and praying privately; 
and take no thought of their own lives of tomorrow. "Be ye therefore 
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Christ 
commanded the multitudes.
<P>
Christ knew that His listeners could not live up to these exacting 
standards without divine assistance, but He presented them as an ideal, 
something to strive for, and He offered us another gift, His grace, by 
which we might truly have hope of attaining perfection. This vision of 
utopia is at once the most unrealistic ever presented to man and at the 
same time the only one that we can really, with God's grace, hope to 
enjoy. It is everything that this world is not, and we must renounce the 
things of this world if we are to share in that one.
<P>
More than 400 years after the birth of Christ, the great Christian 
theologian Augustine gave to the temporal approximation of this utopia 
the name "The City of God" and juxtaposed it to the earthly city: "The 
one consists of those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those 
who wish to live after the spirit." According to Augustine, the earthly 
city has been formed by "the love of self, even to the contempt of God: 
the heavenly city by the love of God, even to the contempt of self." The 
end of the heavenly city is "peace in eternal life," whereas "the earthly 
city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace."
<P>
In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas adapted Aristotle's philosophy to 
the formulation of his own Summa Theologica. Like Aristotle, 
Aquinas maintained that the end of man is happiness, but he insisted 
that this happiness is an eternal one that we cannot obtain in this world.

<h2>Founding Fathers</h2></center><P> 
[The Declaration of Independence and our U.S. Constitution incorporate 
the wisdom of the ages. They are a gift to us from our Founding 
Fathers.]
<P>
The Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas affirmed the right of subjects 
to depose a king "if, becoming a tyrant, he abuses the royal power." In 
this he anticipated the thinking of the 17th century English philosopher 
John Locke and of the American patriots who declared their 
independence from the British crown in 1776.
<P>
According to John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government, the 
authority of political power derives from a social contract agreed to 
voluntarily by free, equal, and independent men. That power loses its 
authority when, by violating this contract, it loses the consent of the 
parties thereto. Locke conceded that the people are generally reluctant to 
exercise this power to dissolve ineffective or oppressive governments: 
"Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, 
and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without 
mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses, prevarications, and 
artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, 
and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are 
going, it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves 
and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them 
the ends for which government was at first erected."
<P>
Locke went to great lengths to distinguish liberty from license and to 
demonstrate that law is the liberator, not the oppressor of man. "Law, in 
its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and 
intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no farther than is 
for the general good of those under that law," said Locke. He argued that 
"the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge 
freedom," emphasizing that freedom is not, however, "a liberty for every 
man to do what he [pleases]."
<P>
The Declaration of Independence enumerated the abuses of royal power 
that the founding fathers considered sufficient to justify their 
renunciation of the king's sovereignty. There, and in the Preamble to the 
Constitution of the United States, they spelled out the principles that 
formed the foundation of their  vision of a better world. Echoes of 
Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and John Locke can be 
heard in both documents. The Constitution with its Bill of Rights 
incorporates the wisdom of the ages. By protecting our God-given rights 
from the encroachment of government we expand our freedom to pursue 
true happiness.
<P>
In this season of gift-giving, let us be grateful not only for the gifts that 
God has given us directly but also for those that have come to us through 
the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Let us pass these gifts on to our 
descendants in the hope that they too will share our vision of a better 
world.

<h2>Christmas Verse</h2></center><P>

[Everyone loves the Clement Moore classic "A Visit from St. Nick." 
Here's a revised version of that yuletide favorite that recaptures the true 
meaning of Christmas.]
<p>
Twas the morning of Christmas, when all through the house/All the 
family was frantic, including my spouse;/For each one of them had one 
thing only in mind,/To examine the presents St. Nick left behind./The 
boxes and wrapping and ribbons and toys/Were strewn on the floor, and 
the volume of noise/Increased as our children began a big fight/Over who 
got the video games, who got the bike./I looked at my watch and I said, 
slightly nervous,/"Let's get ready for church, so we won't miss the 
service."/The children protested "We don't want to pray:/We just got our 
presents, and we want to play!"
<p>
It dawned on me then that we had gone astray,/In confusing the purpose 
of this special day;/Our presents were many and very high-priced/But 
something was missing -- that something was Christ!/I said, "Put the gifts 
down and let's gather together,/And I'll tell you a tale of the greatest gift 
ever:/A Savior was promised when Adam first sinned,/And the hopes of 
the world upon Jesus were pinned./Abraham begat Isaac, who Jacob 
begat,/And through David the line went to Joseph, whereat/This carpenter 
married a maiden with child,/Who yet was a virgin, in no way defiled./ 
Saying 'Hail, full of Grace,' an archangel appeared/To Mary the Blessed, 
among women revered:/The Lord willed she would bear -- through the 
Spirit -- a Son./Said Mary to Gabriel, 'God's will be done.'
<p>
"Now Caesar commanded a tax would be paid,/And all would go home 
while the census was made;/Thus Joseph and Mary did leave Galilee/For 
the city of David to pay this new fee./Mary's time had arrived, but the inn 
had no room,/So she laid in a manger the fruit of her womb;/And both 
Joseph and Mary admired as He napped/The Light of the World in his 
swaddling clothes wrapped./Three wise men from the East had come 
looking for news/Of the birth of the Savior, the King of the Jews;/They 
carried great gifts as they followed a star --/Gold, frankincense, myrrh, 
which they'd brought from afar.
<p>
"As the shepherds watched over their flocks on that night,/The glory of 
God shone upon them quite bright,/And an angel explained the intent of 
the birth,/Saying, 'Glory to God and His peace to the earth.'/For this was 
the Messiah whom prophets foretold,/A good Shepherd to bring His 
sheep back to the fold;/He was God become man, He would die on the 
cross,/He would rise from the dead to restore Adam's loss.
<p>
"Santa Claus, Christmas presents, a brightly lit pine,/Candy canes and 
spiced eggnog are all very fine;/Let's have fun celebrating, but leave not a 
doubt/That Christ is what Christmas is really about!"/The children right 
then put an end to the noise,/They dressed quickly for church, put aside 
all their toys;/For they knew Jesus loved them and said they were 
glad/That He'd died for their sins, and to save their dear Dad.
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Secular Humanism</h2></center><P>

[Paul Kurtz, president and editor-in-chief of Prometheus Books, 
explained once in an Associated Press interview exactly what it is that he 
and other "secular humanists" actually believe.]
<p>
"Secular humanists are committed to the use of reason and science to 
understand the world," said Paul Kurtz. "We also believe it's necessary to 
develop a new morality appropriate to the present needs. I believe in the 
use of reason to build a good life on this planet without the illusion of 
salvation or immortality." That good life and that new morality are the 
subjects of a number of written works bearing the emblem of Kurtz's 
publishing house, Prometheus Books. Here-are some of the titles: 
Atheism: The Case Against God,  Beneficent Euthanasia, The 
Encyclopedia of Unbelief, The New Sexual Revolution, Ethics Without 
God, and Religion Without God.
<p>
In an essay entitled "Humanism and the Moral Revolution," Kurtz 
contends that traditional morality has been made obsolete by "an 
explosive technology that has rapidly transformed our culture. A sharp 
disparity has emerged between the new technology and our inherited 
moral codes." Kurtz believes that "the good life is achieved when we 
realize the human potential. This means that we ought to reject all those 
creeds and dogmas that impede human fulfillment or impose external 
authoritarian rules upon human beings. The traditional supernaturalistic 
moral commandments are especially repressive of our human needs," 
says Kurtz. "They are immoral insofar as they foster illusions about 
human destiny and suppress vital inclinations."
<p>
In another essay, Kurtz confides that Humanism "is related to a doctrine 
of liberation and emancipation. It values the autonomy of free agents, not 
only in their intellectual beliefs but in their aesthetic experience, their 
romantic or sexual proclivities, their moral tastes and values." No subject 
is taboo to free-thinking secular humanists -- no subject, that is, except 
one: belief in God. The faithful will be outcast in the coming new order, 
and the measure of the "freedom" of what passes for thought will be the 
fervency of one's nonbelief. "Humanism cannot in any fair sense of the 
word apply to one who still believes in God as the source and creator of 
the universe," Kurtz comments.
<p>
Will free-thinking secular humanists suffer the faithful to exist as 
harmless anomalies and quaint anachronisms? No, our faith is a constant 
challenge to their infidelity; it makes them feel bad. Humanists cannot be 
truly free until all belief and all believers are exterminated. "For 
Humanism has always been opposed to any and all forms of tyranny over 
the mind of man," proclaims Kurtz. "This puts Humanism squarely in 
opposition to all authoritarian, religious or totalitarian ideologies that 
attempt to suppress, limit or censor human intelligence or to impose an 
orthodoxy of belief or morality." It's an unpleasant fact, but secular 
humanism and faith in God cannot coexist. One of the two must 
ultimately triumph. Rest assured that humanists, if they ever have the 
power, will not tolerate us as we have tolerated them.

<h2>Bosnia</h2></center><P>

[The war in Bosnia is a European affair, and European nations should 
settle it. The United States has no strategic interests in Bosnia and gains 
nothing by getting involved.]
<p>
In a historic address to the U.S. Congress, the President acknowledged 
that the interests of European nations are of no particular significance to 
the United States. These nations get embroiled in "frequent controversies, 
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns," said the 
President, concluding that it would be "unwise" to get involved in matters 
of purely European concern. The geographic isolation of the United 
States is a tremendous strategic advantage, and Americans should make 
full use of it. The President said it would be foolish to jeopardize the 
peace and prosperity of our country by thrusting ourselves into the 
middle of the age-old ethnic and national rivalries of Europe.
<p>
These, alas, are not the sentiments of President Bill Clinton. They were 
expressed by an American president, however -- our very first president, 
in fact. President George Washington made his remarks 900 years ago in 
the Farewell Address that culminated his two terms in office. With those 
parting words, Washington advised his countrymen to protect our Union 
against the internal threat of factions and the external threat of foreign 
entanglements. <p>

Like most of our twentieth-century presidents, Bill Clinton is either 
ignorant of, or indifferent to, the warning issued by the Father of our 
Country -- as Clinton's decision to send 20,000 American soldiers into 
Bosnia clearly demonstrates. The President has an obligation to offer the 
American people a persuasive explanation for deployment, but he has yet 
to identify a compelling national interest in Bosnia, and his justifications 
so far seem specious at best. No matter how much the President may 
insist that we do, America does NOT have a moral duty to send troops to 
Bosnia. America does NOT have "values" that must be protected there. 
America does NOT need to go to Bosnia to assert its leadership in the 
world.
<p>
Clinton's status as Commander-in-Chief empowers him to deploy U.S. 
troops in defense of American citizens or interests; it does NOT entitle 
him to send troops anywhere he pleases for whatever reason he chooses. 
Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia will NOT keep the fighting from 
escalating into a wider conflict, it will do just the opposite. Our troops 
will NOT be "peacekeepers," for there is no peace to keep in Bosnia, nor 
has there been for some 500 years. U.S. servicemen should NOT be 
forced to assume the role of international policemen.
<p>
If Europe wants an end to the bloodletting in Bosnia, let European 
nations stop it. They have all the requisite resources. America, in the 
meantime, should concentrate on American interests. We should heed the 
advice that George Washington gave in his famous Farewell Address: 
"The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in 
extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political 
connection as possible."

<h2>Illiteracy and Delinquency</h2></center><P> . 

[Everyone's got his own idea of the best way to reduce crime -- more  
policemen, longer sentences, more prisons, and so on. But a number of  
studies suggest that teaching criminals to read may be the best solution of  
all!] 
 <p>
The National Adult Literacy Survey, commissioned by the U.S.  
Department of Education, found in 1993 that nearly half our adult  
population are poor readers. Another U.S. Department of Education  
survey, also in 1993, disclosed that more than two-thirds of U.S.  
schoolchildren cannot read up to their grade level. Al Shanker, longtime  
president of the American Federation of Teachers, declared in 1989 that  
only 3 to 6 percent of 17- and 18-year-olds are able to read editorials and  
articles in major newspapers and write a several-page essay. He said that  
80 percent of public school graduates cannot even write a two-paragraph  
letter to a supermarket manager applying for a job. A study on illiteracy  
commissioned by the Department of Justice in l992 said that 21 million  
Americans can't read at all, 45 million are marginally illiterate, and 20  
percent of high school graduates can't read their diplomas. 
 <p>
A l 993 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that "the major cause  
of delinquency" is reading failure, and that-children in schools are  
"denied the means to achieve the goal to read." Juvenile delinquents and  
adult prisoners who are taught to read using a traditional intensive  
phonics method show a marked decrease in behavior problems as they  
become literate. 
 <p>
With a research grant funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Michael  
Brunner spent two years analyzing the literature on illiteracy and  
recidivism. In a new book called Retarding America: The Imprisonment  
of Potential, he comes to the chilling conclusion that reading failure is a  
major cause, rather than just a correlate, of anti-social behavior. Brunner  
found that a high percentage of incarcerated juveniles were diagnosed  
early in school as "learning disabled" even though there was no evidence  
of specific neurological abnormalities. These children never received the  
kind of reading instruction that is successful -- namely, intensive,  
systematic phonics. So they never learned how to identify sounds in  
isolation, to blend individual speech sounds into words, or to segment  
polysyllabic words into speech sounds. Brunner discovered that failure to  
learn to read is a major cause for the frustration and low self-esteem that  
lead to juvenile delinquency. 
 <p>
Brunner reports a poignant interview with an incarcerated teenage boy  
who could decipher only four words and spell two. His years in the public  
school system were a time of constant humiliation because he could not  
read. Combative behavior was the only means he could think of to keep  
his peers from laughing at him. In the correctional institution, the boy  
was taught to read with remedial intensive phonics. Another teenager,  
interviewed at Ironwood Maximum Security Prison, felt like a new  
person once he had mastered phonics and learned to read. It sounds  
incredible, but making sure children learn how to read in the first grade is  
a proven crime prevention technique!

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>Breast Cancer Goose Chase Harms Everyone</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P> 
Question: How many studies does it take to establish that the cause of 
an illness is not pollution?  Answer: There are never enough when the 
accusers are a combined force of feminists and environmentalists.
<p>
Since the early 1990s, women in the Northeastern U.S., especially Long 
Island, New York, have been claiming that A) they are suffering an 
extraordinary rate of breast cancer, and that B) the cause most 
assuredly lies in the hand of man.  What the specific pollutant is, 
they have been at a loss to say--pesticides in general,  chlorinated 
chemicals, power lines.  The point is that some faceless, nameless 
corporation run by insensitive (no doubt cigar-chomping) white males 
has to be at fault.
<p>
Environmentalists have willingly accommodated them in this belief.  
Not long ago the left-wing magazine Mother Jones featured a cover with 
a woman wearing a gas mask as a brassiere.
<p>
Now there has appeared the latest in a series of studies showing that 
pollution isn't the cause of these higher breast cancer rates.  And 
you know what?  No one seems to care.
<p>
This study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute 
(JNCI), shows that women in the Northeast are indeed more likely to 
die of breast cancer than in other regions of the country.  It also 
found the risk was almost completely due to certain risk factors which 
these women have incurred, including having children later in life and 
greater rates of alcohol use and obesity.
<p>
Other lifestyle factors not looked at could probably explain the rest.
<p>
"This [study] suggests there is nothing uniquely hazardous about 
living in the Northeast," said Joseph K. McLaughlin of the 
International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
But the activists don't want to hear this. Cindy Pearson, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Women's Health Network, 
told the Boston Globe the study "doesn't set my mind at ease, and it 
doesn't make me think there aren't environmental factors at work."
<p>
The federal government's chase after pollutants as a cause of breast 
cancer can be traced back to May 1992, when Long Island women began 
demanding that federal health officials find a bad guy to blame for 
what they perceived as an  extraordinary breast cancer rate in their 
area.  "Women want to know: Why me?  Why now?  Why on Long Island?" 
said one activist.<p>

More telling were the words of Francine Kritchek, co-chair of "One in 
Nine."  "Women are tired of being told that it is because of their 
educational background, their high socio-economic status, their ethnic 
background and their age that they are prone to this illness," she 
said.  In other words, bring me somebody's--ANYBODY'S-- head on a 
platter.
<p>
At the time, four state studies had failed to find connection between 
breast cancer in the state and environmental influences such as 
pesticides.  Nevertheless, with the help of the state's Republican 
U.S. Senator, Al D'Amato, the lobbying has paid off in the form of 
several lavish studies.  The JNCI study was one of them.  And despite 
its negative findings, the NCI is moving forward with a much larger 
one investigating the possible connection between environmental 
factors and breast cancer, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study 
Project. The cost?  An incredible $7 million.
<p>
Yet in 1993 still another study found that the Long Island breast 
cancer rate wasn't extraordinary.  Using a computer database, the Long 
Island-based newspaper Newsday discovered, "The highest breast cancer 
incidence rates were in the San Francisco Bay area, suburban Boston, 
and suburban Chicago, not on Long Island.  Nassau and Suffolk (the 
counties making up Long Island) ranked right in the middle of the 
group studied."
<p>
Did this mollify the Long Island activists?  Far from it. "The fact 
that Long Island isn't alone isn't a comforting thought at all--it's 
an even more disturbing message," one told Newsday.
<p>
Get it? The original problem was that Long Island's breast cancer rate 
was so extraordinarily high. When it turned out it wasn't 
extraordinarily high it was proof of an even greater problem.  Do the 
words "no-win situation" come to mind?
<p>
All of this might be a bit humorous, were in not for a couple of 
considerations. First, this fanatical quest for corporate villains to 
blame is coming at a real human cost. What incentive does a woman have 
to reduce her lifestyle risks if she's convinced that nothing she's 
doing is contributing to her chances of breast cancer?
<p>
Second, these studies are extremely expensive and are a terrific waste 
of time for our nation's top researchers.  In general, breast cancer 
spending--like that of AIDS--is completely disproportionate to its 
incidence.
<p>
Compare breast cancer with prostate cancer. Breast cancer probably 
struck about 183,000 American women in 1995, killing 46,000. Prostate 
cancer probably afflicted about 244,000 men, killing 35,000.  Breast 
cancer survivors may lose one or both breasts, a cruel maiming but one 
fixable through plastic surgery.  More and more often the disease is 
being treated by removal of the tumor only.
<p>
Prostate surgery survivors, conversely, often face permanent impotence 
and incontinence.  But while breast cancer will receive $500 million 
from the feds, prostate cancer will get less than $80 million.  There 
are no studies looking for environmental causes of prostate cancer.
<p>
There are only so many medical researchers and funds to go around.  
It's time we start using our resources based on where they can do the 
most good.  Endless efforts to satisfy paranoid activists don't meet 
that standard.

</center><hr>



<P> 


You've probably never heard the term "nocebo" before, but you've 
almost certainly suffered from it.  More than that, the nocebo effect 
is a major player in some of today's biggest health scares.
<P>
A nocebo is a negative placebo. That is, while a placebo pill makes 
you feel better though unbeknownst to you it's only made of sugar,  a 
nocebo makes you feel bad though physiologically speaking it shouldn't 
be able to.
<P>
For example, if someone in your office is suffering from a cold you, 
too, may feel your throat tightening, your bones aching a bit, your 
head hurting perhaps.  Sound familiar? It's happened to all of us.
<P>
When a newspaper at which I worked moved to a new building somebody 
told the librarian that there was formaldehyde in her new library 
bookshelves.  Formaldehyde is a suspected human carcinogen and the 
librarian knew this.  Soon she was suffering from a headache, aching 
joints, and labored breathing--all classic psychosomatic symptoms.
<P>
But then she heard there was no formaldehyde in the shelves. Suddenly 
the symptoms disappeared.  Apparently the final word on the shelves 
was that they did contain formaldehyde but the librarian remained 
blissfully ignorant of this and hence symptom free.
<P>
Nocebos don't get talked about much, which is why the American Health 
Foundation (AHF) recently called together a number of experts for a 
conference on the subject. For nocebos aren't just minor curiosities, 
but are wreaking havoc in America today.
<P>
"We think nocebo has a powerful effect," says AHF President Ernst 
Wynder,  "particularly if the suggestion is made by your doctor and 
then your lawyer and then the newspapers."
<P>
Examples?  Consider Gulf War Syndrome. Tens of thousands of Gulf War 
vets are now claiming that something they were exposed to in the Gulf 
is making them ill. Their list of symptoms totals more than 75, with 
the most common being the classic psychosomatic symptoms such as the 
librarian suffered. Yet study after study, including one just released 
from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, have 
showed that Gulf War vets have no more discernible illness than one 
would expect in a group of that size and age category.
<P>
Curiously, virtually none of the sick soldiers complained for the 
first couple of years after the war. Then reservists began to say they 
were sick but the active duty soldiers still had no complaints. That's 
when it hit the newspapers and television, with every news report 
stating emphatically that the syndrome was real. Suddenly the active 
duty soldiers were falling ill, too.
<P>
Yet for the longest time the mysterious ailment remained confined to 
the United States.  Why?  Because other nation's media weren't 
covering the topic.  When the British press started writing about Gulf 
War Syndrome, suddenly British soldiers began falling ill.
<P>
Another example? Try silicone breast implants.
<P>
"For 30 years women were satisfied with implants," Emory University 
gynecology and obstetrics professor Dr. Elizabeth Connell told me.  
Connell headed the FDA panel that investigated the implants.  "Lot of 
studies at the [FDA] hearings and since then showed a very high level 
of pleasure and acceptance and gratitude."
<P>
But then the media and the lawyers got in the act.  Newspapers and 
magazines ran stories with titles like "Ticking Time Bombs,"  "Toxic 
Breasts," and "After Implants, Horror Began."  Suddenly women with 
implants were suffering all sorts of strange illnesses and "realizing" 
that illnesses they already had must be related to their implants.
<P>
"When you have women being told they have ticking timebombs in their 
breasts, what are they to think?" said Connell.
<P>
As with Gulf War Syndrome, the breast implant scare  appears to be 
confined to U.S. shores. Yes, strangely enough, silicone only makes 
American women sick.
<P>
Media reports have also kicked off other famous incidents of hysteria, 
such as a rash of illness at New York's Love Canal after the local 
newspaper informed the citizens they were living on top of a toxic 
waste dump.
<P>
Sometimes there's more to this than blind panic.  There's what 
Columbia University psychologist Dr. Herbert Spiegel, who spoke at the 
AHF conference, calls "secondary gain."
<P>
What this means is that the nocebo effect can be greatly exaggerated 
when the sufferer finds out there's something to be obtained through 
the suffering. Sometimes it's just sympathy. Other times its being 
taken off a job one doesn't like. And sometimes it's big bucks, which 
is where lawyers come in.
<P>
Spiegel is convinced that secondary gain is behind many of the breast 
implant claims, what with some law firms advertising "$100,000 OR MORE 
MAY BE OWED TO YOU!" if you have silicone breast implants.
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that many, " he told me, "of those women . . . 
have an eye on the deep pockets" implant manufacturers.
<P>
Likewise for Gulf War Syndrome, from which many soldiers hope to gain 
lifetime disability pay and others have joined a class action suit 
against numerous chemical companies. "Gulf War Syndrome is a wonderful 
illustration of what I'm talking about," says Dr. Spiegel.
<P>
Can the nocebo effect be cured? Sure. The media, the courts, and the 
general public need to take a healthy dose of skepticism. This won't 
be a popular remedy; it's not as emotionally gratifying as blaming bad 
guys (corporations, government) or as financially rewarding as suing 
them. But then, the best medicine seldom tastes good. It's just good 
for us.

<i>1/17/96</i><hr><h2>Catch Drunks, Don't Harass Drivers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<P> 
On Christmas Eve, 1966, my godfather smashed his car into a tree and 
killed himself.  He was drunk. The best that could be said of his 
sorry exit from this earth was that unlike so many other drunk 
drivers, he didn't take anybody with him.
<P>
You might think this would make me very concerned with drunk driving 
laws and you'd be right. But you'd be wrong if you think it has made 
me an advocate of the continuing trend to reduce allowable levels of 
drivers' blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.1 percent to 0.08 percent.
<P>
It's not that I wouldn't be in good company.  Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) have lobbied vigorously for lowering the limit to .08, while 
the American Medical Association wants it lowered to 0.05 and the 
Department of Health and Human Services wants it knocked down even 
lower to 0.04. But the evidence these good folks cite to support their 
new drinking laws just doesn't wash.
<P>
True, the number of what the NHTSA calls "alcohol-related deaths" has 
shown a steady and significant decline since the early 1980s. During 
that time, a number of states--now totaling 13--have screwed down the 
legal BAC limit from 0.1 to 0.08.
<P>
But does this mean there's a connection? The key word is "deaths." In 
fact, traffic deaths in general have been going down for years as a 
result of safer cars and higher seat belt usage rates. So it only 
makes sense that those from any given cause, including alcohol, would 
be declining.
<P>
A better measure is alcohol-related collisions.  This number has gone 
down just a bit, and it's not at all clear it has to do with those few 
states lowering their BAC limits.
<P>
It's not that drivers don't show signs of impairment at levels below a 
BAC of 0.1.  Indeed, research has shown impairment at levels of 0.04 
or even lower. I drink so little alcohol myself that I could probably 
be impaired driving by a brewery and smelling the smoke stack exhaust.
<P>
Rather, the issue is should we put out a net so wide and so tightly-
woven as to sweep up huge numbers of people or should we concentrate 
on those most likely to create carnage on the streets?
<P>
The net analogy is not a bad one. Even advocates of a 0.08 BAC limit 
admit that drivers below the level of .1 rarely drive erratically, 
hence the only way to catch them will be putting up more police 
roadblocks and doing more random breath testing.  And what will we get 
for these pesky little violations of drivers' privacy?
<P>
Dr. H. Laurence Ross, a professor at the University of New Mexico and 
author most recently of Confronting Drunk Driving, estimates a 
potential increase of 60 percent of DWI offenders (legally-speaking) 
under 0.08 with the possibility of no decrease in fatalities. The 
reason is that the potential of alcohol to impair drivers and cause 
accidents is directly proportionate to the amount consumed.
<P>
According to a recently released study from the Harvard Injury Control 
Center, "Among all male drinking drivers who were killed, 67 percent 
had BACs of 0.15 or above.  Among young adult male drivers (ages 20-
34), 41 percent had BACs of at least 0.20, or twice the legal limit in 
most states."
<P>
Lower BAC advocates note that about 3,000 fatalities each year are 
caused by drivers with BACs of less than 0.1.  But this is misleading. 
The vast majority of fatalities are caused by people with no 
measurable alcohol in their systems at all, yet they still managed to 
kill someone.  For all we know, the drivers who killed those 3,000 
people would have done so just as readily without the aid of liquor. 
<P>
Ironically, one opponent of .08 BAC laws is MADD founder Candy 
Lightner.  In 1992 she wrote, "If we really want to save lives, let's 
go after the most dangerous drivers on the road.  Putting our trust in 
new laws and regulations that attack only the tip of the iceberg will 
not make our highways safer."
<P>
Lightner has been branded a traitor by MADD, especially since two 
years after writing those words she became a lobbyist for the liquor 
industry. Nevertheless knows whereof she speaks.  The man who ran down 
her own 13-year-old daughter in 1980 has been arrested several times 
for drunken driving, each time with a BAC of 0.2 or higher.  And each 
time he gets out of jail and goes at it again.
<P>
Lightner argues that police ought to concentrate their resources on 
arresting drunk drivers, not just drivers who happen to have been 
drinking. When serious offenders are arrested they need to be treated 
seriously, with license revocations and other penalties that increase 
steadily as their number of offenses increases. 
<P>
But to arrest drunk drivers you need police, and suddenly declaring 60 
percent more Americans as criminally inebriated will stretch resources 
thinner than ever.  "Adoption of 0.08 percent BAC has not to date been 
accompanied by any comparable new investments in police resources," 
notes Dr. Ross in a recent issue of Health Drinking magazine, "thus 
diluting an already inadequate control system.  The effect may well be 
to reduce the chances of any impaired drivers being arrested."
<P>
That's something to think about the next time a weaving automobile 
shoots past you and you wonder how come there's never a cop around 
when you need one.

Imagine a car with a third the cruising range of the cheapest one on 
the market.  Imagine that while the cheapest car takes about three 
minutes to refuel this one takes three to 15 hours, depending on the 
equipment you buy to refuel it.  Imagine that the car will only be 
sold in a few markets in the southwest because it's useless in cold 
temperatures.  Now, if your imagination really stretches, imagine that 
this joke of an automobile costs about $35,000 or four times what the 
cheapest car goes for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But this is no imaginary car. It's General Motors' much-celebrated EV1 
electric car, the product of many years of development and one 
extremely large dose of environmental nonsense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Resembling a turtle with angular lines, GM's electric Edsel isn't the 
technological marvel it's advertised to be. Indeed, it's all too 
similar to the electric cars that competed with and lost to piston 
engine-powered cars almost 100 years ago.  Moreoever, piston 
technology has improved steadily since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;An economy car equipped with such an engine can be propelled an 
amazing 50 miles with a mere gallon of gasoline that weighs only eight 
pounds and costs less than bottled water.  The EV1, in contrast, uses 
low-tech lead acid batteries that in the best of weather propel the 
car only 90 miles with 1175 pounds of batteries, almost half the 
weight of the car itself.  Other types of batteries such as nickel-
metal hydride, nickel cadmium, zinc-air, and lithium would give a much 
longer charge but at even greater expense.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The lead-acid batteries are not only heavy but huge.  The EV1 has only 
two seats, not because it pretends to be a sports car but rather 
because batteries take up what would be the back seat. Lead-acid 
batteries also last only two to three years and are an environmental 
mess to dispose of in a land fill. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all the criticisms of  electric cars are deserved--just most of 
them.  For example, some on the extreme fringe of the environmental 
movement claim that they shouldn't be labeled zero emission vehicles 
because the power plants that supply the electricity emit pollution 
when they burn coal or oil.  True, but the emissions which electric 
cars produce are generally far outside the city where pollution is a 
problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's too bad some of the environmental nuts don't understand this, 
because essentially, GM has built a car that only a rich tofu-eating 
environmental looney could be interested in--like, say, actor/activist 
Ed Begley Jr.  Problem is, he already has one.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;That's a huge chunk of the electric car market that's already got one 
in the garage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But it's not really GM that built the EV1; rather it's the bureaucrats 
at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) who did.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In a fit of  both arrogance and technological ignorance, CARB mandated 
back in 1990 that by 1998, two percent of all new cars sold in 
California would have to be zero-emission ones, thus sending the car 
companies scrambling to develop electric vehicles. Ironically, just 
two weeks before the EV1 was announced, CARB backed down  and pushed 
the mandate off into the 21st Century.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Why GM decided to market the car anyway is anyone's guess, though 
rumors fly (which a GM spokesman denied to me) that the introduction 
was a quid pro quo to get CARB to drop the mandate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to ignoring technological reality, the CARB mandate also 
ignored how much cleaner cars have already gotten.  Cars built these 
days put out only about four percent of the exhaust of cars produced 
in 1970. That's why the air above every American city has gotten so 
much cleaner since then.  The reason these cars sometimes put out 
large amounts of  pollution is because like anything mechanical, they 
can break and must be repaired.  Also, their owners can tamper with them to improve mileage at the expense of high emissions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;What's needed is a device that can detect defective or tampered-with 
exhaust systems.  It happens that Dr. Donald Stedman and other 
researchers at the University of Denver have invented just such a 
device.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;When placed by the side of the road, it measures how much pollution a 
car puts out as it drives  by. High emissions trigger a video camera 
which films both the car and its license plate. This allows the 
municipality using the device to send a letter (perhaps backed by a 
threat of a fine) to the violator informing him that his car emits too 
much pollution and must be repaired.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The ability of remote sensing to "read" vehicle exhaust accurately and 
cheaply has been demonstrated repeatedly in the U.S. as well as in 
Canada and Great Britain. Alas, its biggest advantage is its biggest 
drawback.  Because it only singles out gross polluters and leaves most 
of us alone, bureaucrats hate it.  They'd rather foist upon us 
nonsense like the EV1 electric turkey.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's possible that electric cars will one day be a viable form of 
transportation for something other than short trips or putting around 
the golf course, but that day is years away.  For now, rather than 
giving in to environmentalist pleas and extortion, the automakers 
should line up behind remote sensing as a way of keeping gasoline cars 
running clean.

<h2>Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>

<P>  
Six years ago there was panic in the streets over a chemical sprayed  
on apples called Alar.  Parents threw out their apple sauce and poured  
apple juice down the sinks.  One poor mother went so far as to call  
the state police to have them pull over her child's school bus and  
remove the apple from his lunch pail.  If Dr. Samuel Epstein had his  
way, it would be deja vu all over again, but this time with milk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at the University  
of Illinois School of Public Health in Chicago has created a stir in  
the nation's media, if not yet its grocery stores.  He claims, in the  
January International Journal of Health Services, that much of the  
milk sold today contains a possible potent cancer-causing agent called  
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, or rBGH. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hormone occurs naturally in cows but scientists can now clone it  
and give it to the animals in larger doses than they would normally  
produce, thereby increasing milk production about 10 to 15 percent.   
Perhaps five percent of all milk sold now is produced this way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's claim--in a journal which is neither peer-reviewed nor  
widely read (I had never even heard of it before)--is that IGF-1, a  
hormone responsible for cell growth and division, is more abundant and  
potent in milk from rBGH-treated cows. The hormone may act "indirectly  
by sensitizing the breast to subsequent unrelated risk factors" such  
as radiation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes, and it may give you super powers and allow you to leap tall  
buildings with a single bound, but there's precious little evidence  
for either hypothesis. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's allegation uses no new evidence and indeed his charge isn't  
new.  He's been on the warpath against rBGH since at least 1989, when  
it was moving through the approval process. Cancer is just one several  
nasties he accuses it of causing, including increasing the chance of  
contaminating milk with pus from an infection of the udders called  
mastitis. Yuk! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During these six years of attempted sabotage, Epstein's claims have  
been repeatedly rebuffed by the best names in the business.  The  
Journal of the National Institutes of Health Research has reported  
that Epstein's "scientific evidence is slim" and is based on a single  
31-year-old paper by endocrinologist Peter Forsham.  Forsham, it said,  
"called Epstein's interpretation of his work `ridiculous.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Agencies and respected organizations such as the American Cancer  
Society (ACS),  the American Medical Association (AMA), the FDA, the  
National Institutes of Health, the American Dietetic Association, and  
the World Health Organization have all put their stamps of approval on  
rBGH and strongly repudiated Epstein. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The bottom line in the scientific community, "An AMA spokesman  
recently reiterated, "that there is no evidence that there's any link  
to anything that could be hazardous to your health." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ACS points out that, "Extensive testing and research [have] shown  
that [rBGH] is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth hormone  
and thus entails no health risks for consumers."  Not only that,  
rBGH actually can't do what Epstein claims. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His  theory assumes that the hormone can enter and remain viable in  
the digestive tract.  But as Dr. Michael J. MacDonald, a University of  
Wisconsin pediatric endocrinologist who studies the effects of  
hormones on children has pointed out, IGF-1 is produced not in the  
stomach but the liver, and if it entered the digestive system, stomach  
acids and enzymes would destroy it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it got into milk it wouldn't be absorbed," he told a reporter.   
"It's a protein. It would be digested." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'd drink it any time," he said of milk from rBGH-treated cows, "and  
if my children were infants, I'd feed it to them." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein, you see, is one of the three horsemen of the cancer  
apocalypse.  (The other two are Devra Lee Davis, now with the Public  
Health Service, and Dr. David Rall, retired director of the National  
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). There's an excellent  
chance that if you're hearing that we are suffering an epidemic of  
cancer from man-made causes, be it from petroleum products,  
pesticides, or now Bessie the Cow--you're hearing it from, or at least  
because of, them. 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has testified before Congress that 70 to 90 percent of cancer cases  
result from man-made products.  In a just-released video critical of  
his positions, "Science Under Siege" produced by the Competitive  
Enterprise Institute and National Empowerment Television, Epstein  
tells the audience, "Escalating increasing [sic] cancer rates over  
recent decades is a result of exposure to avoidable carcinogens in  
air, water, and food and the workplace." 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein regularly makes such preposterous statements, which I know  
because the media just as regularly repeat them. He is the fair-haired  
boy of  the apocalyptic environmental movement and of the media.  A  
search on the Nexis database of magazines, newspapers, and some TV  
news broadcasts pulled up 318 references to both Epstein and cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, though, from what I could tell, the media weren't so  
credulous. Consistently they allowed somebody to refute Epstein's  
mooings. Let's hope next time reporters ignore this quack altogether  
and devote precious news print to real problems. This fair-haired boy  
has long since cried "wolf" too often to be taken seriously.

<title>Fumento: Global Warming Hotheads Use Anything -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>
Global Warming Hotheads Use Anything to Justify Their Theory 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>  
What if the media told you that declining prices across the board were 
a sign that inflation was again rearing its ugly head?  What if they 
told you that sharp drops in murder and assault rates nationally 
indicated that crime was on the upswing?  Wouldn't you be in the least 
bit suspicious, even if you didn't come from Missouri, the "show-me 
state"? 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That's the sense you may have gotten lately in reading articles in the 
national media about how this incredible bun-freezing winter we've 
been having is evidence of global warming.  When we have an especially 
hot summer, they say it's global warming.  Now that records for cold 
temperatures are snapping like so many icicles and the northeast has 
just dug out of its worst blizzard in decades, we're told that's proof 
of global warming, too.  Ever heard of the expression, "Heads I win; 
tails you lose?" 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there it was, the cover of the January 22 Newsweek: "Blizzards, 
Floods & Hurricanes:  Blame Global Warming." There also was the New 
York Times front-page article by William K. Stevens: "Blame Global 
Warming for the Blizzard," and a nationally syndicated article by 
environmentalist Jessica Matthews which ran under such titles as 
"Brrr, Global Warming Brings Our Blizzard." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, these writers have established careers as global 
warming doomsayers.  Stevens harps on it so incessantly as to 
practically put to shame the Roman Senator Cato who insisted upon 
ending every speech with "Carthage must be destroyed." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, sometimes counter-intuitive things happen. That's why somebody 
invented the term "paradox."  But, doomsayers, the idea of warming 
causing freezing cold pushes that just too far. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a silliness about [attributing blizzards to global warming] 
that's just overwhelming," says MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen. 
"Were global warming to occur," he notes, "you would have reduced 
temperature variance."  That's because extreme cold comes from wind 
blowing down from the north. If the north and south poles warm the 
most, as global warming climate models predict, the north would be far 
less likely to produce the kind of icy blasts it has sent to us these 
past few weeks. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Lindzen adds, "The truth of the matter is the poles haven't warmed 
and the storms we're having now produce very cold weather because the 
climate has not behaved the way the models have said they should." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels agrees that extremes 
in temperature would actually decrease if the world grew warmer, from 
night to day and month to month.  "The season to season extremes are 
decreasing," says Michaels. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then how to explain this terrible cold weather if it's not caused by 
warming?  Hmm, that's a toughy. Could it be that when it comes to the 
weather, the abnormal is often the norm? To borrow from one of the 
more vulgar expressions of the day: Bad Weather Happens. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to global warming enthusiasts, any and all aberrations are proof 
that the sky is falling.  Thus, last year's high number of dangerous 
hurricanes was again cited as proof of the warming effect. It made an 
encore on Newsweek's January 22 cover.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, coastal 
inhabitants can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming enthusiasts desperately grasp at anything to prove 
their  case.  In early January the Climatic Research Unit at the 
University of East Anglia made headlines, including the New York 
Times, with a preliminary report saying 1995 was the hottest year on 
record.  But their data was actually for only 11 months. Rather than 
risk December's temperatures spoiling everything they jumped the gun 
and sent out their press releases. Their fears where fulfilled when 
December's average temperature came in at the lowest in 17 years 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a pretty ordinary year," said NASA scientist John Christy, who 
has been analyzing satellite data on temperature since 1979. And James 
Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who pretty much 
started the whole global warming scare, admits his study of land 
areas--where the effects of global warming would be most severe--
revealed 1995 was about 0.02 degrees centigrade cooler than 1990. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the theory of global warming continues to be just that--an 
unproven theory. And even were it valid, the theory cannot explain 
blizzards and cold snaps. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And where does this weather unfit for man or polar bear leave global 
warming skeptics? Just as they have always claimed that an 
exceptionally hot summer doesn't prove global warming, they cannot now 
claim that an exceptionally cold winter disproves it.  And they 
haven't. I've yet to any global warming skeptic make such a claim. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming doomsayers have had similar opportunities for honesty. 
Instead, the likes of Stevens and Matthews went for sensational 
headlines.  To them, any well-publicized weather story is an 
opportunity to promote their pet theory.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, the theory of global warming hasn't been disproved. But clearly 
some of its more fervent enthusiasts need to step back, look at the 
evidence, and chill out.

<h2>
Will the U.S. Repeat Peru's Deadly Chlorine Folly?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA You may have heard the term "red death."  It  
dates back to the middle ages, which is where most North Americans  
probably imagine it.  But it has a modern name: cholera.  And if you  
live in Peru or any of 14 other South American countries, it's very  
real and right now--thanks in part to bad advice from the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi's voice shook with emotion as he described the  
situation to a gathering here of Latin American, British, and U.S.  
policymakers at the Atlas Foundation Workshop on Science, Technology  
and the Environment in Fort Lauderdale. Ten thousand Latin Americans  
have died, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more  
than a million made sick.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ghersi blames "U.S. imperialism." But this imperialism didn't come at  
the point of a bayonet as it has so many times in the past.  Rather it  
came from EPA pronouncements regarding the chlorination of drinking  
water.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chlorine is the most effective killer of bacteria, including that  
which causes cholera,  in water supplies.  While other techniques such  
as ozonation or using ultra-violet light can kill bacteria at the  
point of contact, chlorine added to water keeps on killing all the way  
to the faucet.  New contaminants  after the water leaves the treatment  
facility are still eliminated.  About three-fourths of all U.S.  
drinking water is chlorinated, while most of the rest is treated with  
a combination of chlorine and ammonia.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Chlorination and disinfection of the water supplies are the public  
health success stories of the century," says Carol Henry, director of  
the International Life Sciences Risk Science Institute.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the broad class of chemicals known as chlorines have lately has  
been under an all-out assault by American environmentalists, who  
accuse them of everything from thinning the ozone layer to causing  
cancer to reducing sperm counts to shrinking alligators' penises.   
(Question: How do you measure an alligator's penis? Answer: Very  
carefully.)  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greenpeace International, using the pithy if not overly imaginative  
slogan "Chlorine kills!" (meaning people, not germs), has demanded the  
elimination of all man-made chlorines in use.  This  while leaving  
alone those which occur naturally, such as sodium chloride, better  
known as table salt.  Such a drastic move, according to the consulting  
firm Charles River Associates, would cost the economy $91 billion a  
year.  Other critics say it would cost many American lives, pointing  
to Peru as an example.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What happened in Peru is that their government took the  
environmentalists and the EPA more seriously than ours has so far.   
The EPA has to a great extent bought into the environmentalist anti- 
chlorinated chemical rhetoric, with Administrator Carol Browner  
calling for reducing, if not eliminating, use of chlorines.  The EPA  
has also made much of the fact that some studies have shown a   
slightly increased risk of cancer from drinking chlorinated water.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We Norte-Americanos, who have become somewhat resistant to the  
"everything man-made causes cancer" cries of the environmentalists and  
the EPA, have taken thus far a sane attitude towards this.  Berkeley  
biologist Bruce Ames has noted that if there is any risk of cancer  
from chlorinated water at all, it is a thirtieth that of a serving of  
peanut butter.  But Peruvian bureaucrats bought the rhetoric wholesale  
and greatly reduced the chlorine pumped into the country's water  
supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This set the stage for horror when, Pan American Health Organization  
officials suspect, a Chinese freighter released its cholera- 
contaminated bilge water into the harbor in Lima.  Eventually the  
bacteria made its way into open wells which hadn't been chlorinated at  
all and in other fresh water supplies in which chlorine levels had  
fallen too low to kill the germ.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As is usual with epidemics, the rich have fared considerably better  
than the poor. Peru's rich can afford private water supplies and  
bottled water.  It is the poor, says Ghersi, who "have been sacrificed  
for the EPA and the environmentalists."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Undaunted by all this, the EPA is now taking action that may well  
endanger much of the U.S. water supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Citing the hypothetical cancer risks from chlorination, the agency in  
1994 proposed a rule that would require water systems across the  
country to eliminate the process known as pre-disinfection as a means  
of controlling "disinfection by-products."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to some officials, this unfunded mandate would cost local  
governments an additional $4 million a year and might force small  
water systems to abandon chlorination completely.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The proposed water regulation has some health officials absolutely  
boiling.  "Reducing chlorine levels in public water systems poses an  
immediate and significant threat to public health," says Douglas  
Kinard of the South Carolina Department of Public Health. "A  
conscientious health professional with experience in waterborne  
disease outbreaks should not support a rule which compromises public  
health."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or, as Robert Forbes of the Florida Department of Health and  
Rehabilitative Services put it, "the reduction or elimination of  
chlorination of drinking water to reduce the risk of . . . disease, is  
analogous to reducing or eliminating air travel to protect people on  
the ground from being hit by falling aircraft parts!"  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi hopes that won't happen here as it has in his homeland.  
"We're ahead of the U.S.," Ghersi told me sarcastically.  "And have  
returned to the Middle Ages as a result."

<h2>
Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is
</h2>

<P>
At least once a year, it seems, Americans are hit by a carpet bomb 
attack orchestrated by environmental groups and the media.  The theme: 
Our food supply is killing us because of pesticides used by greedy 
corporations and chemical companies.  Anyone who denies it is accused 
of being a dupe of industry.  But now a counter-attack has been 
launched by the highly influential and independent National Research 
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Far from posing the clear and present danger that the environmental 
groups say they do, the NRC says that the synthetic chemicals that 
prove carcinogenic in large-dose rodent testing are greatly 
outnumbered by natural chemicals which do the same thing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The good news is that according to the report, neither seems to pose 
much risk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"While some chemicals in the diet do have the ability to cause cancer, 
they appear to be a threat only when they are present in foods that 
form an unusually large part of the diet," said Ronald Estabrook, 
chairman of the NRC committee.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What really counts, the report says, is not those things we 
unknowingly take into our bodies in minuscule quantities, but rather 
foods that we intentionally ingest in  massive doses: fats, calories, 
and alcohol. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the report specifically looked at cancer, it certainly bears 
noting that the worst thing about these ingredients is their ability 
to induce death not from cancer but from obesity, heart disease, and 
liver damage.  Further, another dietary component, fiber, has been 
strongly tied to a reduced incidence of cancer and heart disease. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other words, if you're really worried about cancer or your health 
in general, these are the things to concentrate on.  It means, 
essentially, doing what your mom told you to do: eat more fruits and 
vegetables and consume anything else in moderation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet only one in five American children eat five or more servings of 
fruits and vegetables a day, the government's dietary recommendation. 
We get a third of the fiber we're supposed to.  At the same time, 
Americans are taking in more calories than ever and have made 
themselves the fattest western nation on earth, causing an estimated 
300,000 premature deaths each year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental groups have effectively scared many Americans away from 
fresh produce.  The Alar campaign in 1989 remains the most prominent.  
Orchestrated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, it had 60 
Minutes declaring the apple growth regulator Alar, "The most potent 
cancer-causing agent in our food supply."  Actress Meryl Streep 
appeared before Congress to blubber and demand, speaking of course on 
behalf of all mothers, that chemicals like Alar be yanked.  It was. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the Alar campaign was only one of many environmentalist-media 
joint efforts. "Do I Dare to Eat a Strawberry?" ran the title of a New 
York Times article last fall, promoting a paper by the Environmental 
Working Group. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These scares have doubtless impacted buying habits but have had even 
greater impact on regulatory agencies--especially the EPA, which feels 
a need to react to each new horror story. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"I'm very concerned about diets," says Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, 
the scientist whose research into natural carcinogens inspired the NRC 
report. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 "If you don't get enough vitamin C," he told me, "it's like stepping 
unprotected in front of an X-ray machine. And we're spending no money 
trying to get the poor to eat better diets and we're taking on average 
of  $2,000 from each family for EPA regulations.  I think we just have 
our priorities completely out of whack." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That goes for both personal priorities and national ones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On a personal level, we contentedly stuff our faces with Ho-Hos, 
Twinkies, and Big Macs. And while getting significantly more fiber is 
as easy as buying whole wheat bread instead of white, Americans 
overwhelmingly choose white bread, safe in the belief that the 
government is regulating away any and all types of cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nationally, it's time for the feds to end what could be called the rat 
race--the assumption that says that anytime a synthetic chemical in a 
huge dose (typically several hundred thousand times what a human would 
take in) promotes cancer in a laboratory rodent, we must race to 
regulate or ban it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's also time to get rid of the notion (common among 
environmentalists) that whatever nature makes is harmless while 
anything developed in a lab is harmful. As the NRC report--and a mass 
of other evidence--shows, a carcinogen is a carcinogen.  If it's 
present in significant enough amounts to invite regulation, then the 
regulations should apply whether the source was Ma Nature or Dow 
Chemical. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This suggests we need to look at both natural and synthetic 
pesticides, compare them, and come up with better tests," says Fran 
Smith, president of the Washington-based Consumer Alert. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the committee said more naturally occurring chemicals should 
be individually tested for their ability to cause cancer, starting 
with those that are found in the highest concentrations in commonly 
consumed foods.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't count the environmentalist groups out yet.  Over the last 
few years, as their case against synthetic chemicals causing cancer 
has grown weaker and weaker, they've started blaming them for other 
problems.  These include immune dysfunction and declining sperm 
counts.  If it's true that you just can't keep a good man down, that 
goes double for a bad environmentalist.

<h2>
Implant Tests Cashing in on Junk Science 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
"Government Warns on Breast Implants," ran the title of a recent AP 
story. The title was misleading. The issue wasn't breast implants but 
tests claiming to show that such implants may have caused harm. And 
this is a real shame because behind that false headline lies a story 
about one of the greatest health hoaxes of the decade and of how junk 
science permeates the courtroom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The brief article itself was accurate as far as it went. It informed 
readers that the Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors 
against using unapproved tests to detect antibodies to silicone 
leaking into the body from ruptured breast implants or to detect 
illness that silicone may have caused. Antibodies are a defense 
response the body produces to the introduction of a foreign substance. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article failed to point out that these very tests have played a 
key role in trials against silicone implant manufacturers which 
sometimes return verdicts measured in millions of dollars. Their 
existence no doubt played a part in the manufacturers' consenting to a 
$4.2 billion dollar settlement, the largest personal injury settlement 
in history. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article also didn't say that these tests are essentially a scam--
worthless except that, yes, they can pull in verdicts of millions of 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tests generally claim to work by one of three methods: detecting 
chemicals given off by the silicone implant; finding antibodies 
created by the body in reaction to the silicone; or detecting 
antibodies created in reaction to the body's own proteins that have 
been somehow modified by the implant. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Part of the problem with any silicone-detecting test is that we're all 
continually exposed to silicone from a number of sources, including 
puddings, cake mixes, antacids, and lipstick. Diabetics are exposed to 
relatively high levels of silicone as well, through repeated 
injections. Indeed, the very pouch that contains the silicone gel of a 
breast implant is itself made of a form of silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of this, the British Department of Health stated in a 1995 
report: "The fact that anti-silicone antibodies have been detected 
both in silicone implant recipients and, at a lower titre [level], in 
people who had not received medical silicones, raises doubts about 
their significance." The report went on to exonerate silicone implants 
of the charges against them: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, the scam-artist inventors of these tests have enjoyed great 
success pushing their traveling medicine show. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the case of Dr. Nir Kossovsky of the UCLA, an inventor of one 
of the types of tests the FDA warned against. Kossovsky is one of the 
best-known critics of silicone implants, has testified at the FDA 
hearings that resulted in the essential ban on silicone breast 
implants, and is a regular expert witness for plaintiffs in implant-
related trials. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Kossovsky developed what he called Detecsil, for "detect silicone." 
"The Detecsil test confirms whether or not an individual has developed 
an immune response to silicone-associated proteins," declared an 
advertisement. As such, it could be useful in showing whether women 
with autoimmune disease (in which the body's immune system turns on 
itself) got that illness from silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In legal depositions supporting his expert witness testimony, 
Kossovsky cited tests from the famed Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla, California as corroborating his own.  In fact, 
Scripps researchers found the antibodies of autoimmune disease victims 
were the same regardless of whether they had silicone implants or not. 
All the test found was that there was a higher level of antibodies in 
anybody with autoimmune disease, exactly what one would expect. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Scripps has repeatedly to disavowed Kossovsky's statements. Indeed, a 
Scripps researcher was on record as saying, "To my knowledge, there is 
no test that can predict or indicate any specific immune response to 
silicone," which is what the test must do to prove adverse health 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even before this latest public FDA warning, Kossovsky had been warned 
by the Agency to quit using his test. But the damage has been done. 
The test has played a crucial role in numerous implant trials, 
including ones with verdicts of $7 million, $25 million, and an 
incredible $40 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Then consider the case of another company making claims for a test 
able to detect silicone antibodies in women with autoimmune disease. 
It was developed by Emerald Biomedical Services of Woodlands, Texas. 
Dr. Noel Rose of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, one of the 
most prominent researchers in the field, contacted Emerald to see if 
he could confirm their findings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Originally he did, but later he found the same positive reactions in 
women without silicone implants. He informed Emerald the test appeared 
useless, and Emerald sent Rose a letter telling him in politest terms 
to go play in the traffic. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nonetheless Emerald persisted in sending out information packets to 
potential clients boasting that Rose had validated their study--until 
being warned to desist by Johns Hopkins lawyers. In that same packet, 
Emerald offered their services as an expert plaintiffs' witness and 
bragged about the large settlements their test and testimony had 
helped win. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At last Kossovsky and Emerald have been put in their place. But not 
before their tests terrified countless numbers of women and wreaked 
havoc in a major sector of American industry. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's always been a false cliche that crime doesn't pay. It does, and 
so does its close relative, junk science.

<title>Fumento: Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government  -- 3/6/96</title>

<h2>
Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Poor Al Gore.  Even when he correctly diagnoses a problem, he just 
can't come up with a solution that doesn't involve Big Government--
even when Big Government  is the problem in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Case in point: the threat to one of the world's most magnificent and 
important eco-systems, the Florida Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This threat is primarily from sugar farming, which uses up more and 
more of this precious land every year.  Far worse, huge amounts--as 
much as 80 percent--of the phosphorous used in fertilizing sugar cane 
in Florida drains into the Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This sets off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria and 
algae and also fostering the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The farming has also dramatically reduced the flow of fresh water from 
Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades, again damaging the eco-system.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gore's solution to this is a tax-and-spend Democrat's solution to all 
problems--raise taxes and spend them.  Tax all sugar growers a penny a 
pound and spend the money to buy as much as 140,000 acres back from 
farmers to convert them back to marshlands.  His explanation is that 
we already subsidize sugar 18 cents per pound, so really we'd just be 
cutting their subsidy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alas, the situation isn't nearly that simple. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, the government does not directly subsidize sugar. It does 
guarantee sugar farmers a minimum of 18 cents return per pound, but it 
never pays any of that out.  Rather it enforces import restrictions to 
prop the price of sugar up.  Sugar in this country currently 
wholesales for about 23 to 24 cents a pound, about twice the cost 
globally. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what Gore is proposing isn't holding back a bit on a subsidy, it's 
just a tax, and one that will leave the import restrictions completely 
intact. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet it's the import restrictions that are the real cause of the 
problem.  By artificially inflating the production value of sugar, 
they encourage industry to grow far more crops than they otherwise 
would.  In 1981, 334,000 acres of Everglades were used for sugar 
farming; today the number is about half a million acres. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Get rid of the protections and farming in the Everglades will plunge.  
If this puts sugar cropland back to its 1981 level, it will give us 
back 166,000 acres of wetlands--26,000 more than the Gore proposal.  
It will also greatly reduce the price that Americans pay to prop up 
Big Sugar's profits.  In all, the sugar program is estimated to cost 
consumers $1.4 billion a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But what if this doesn't go far enough in helping the Everglades?  
Then step two would be to levy a tax on the polluters themselves, the 
farms in the Everglades.  Taxing beet farmers in Louisiana to pay for 
damage caused by cane farmers in Florida is hardly fair, nor does it 
accomplish the purpose of discouraging environmentally harmful 
farming. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Actually, steps one and two will complement each other.  That's 
because by getting rid of the import restrictions, the price of sugar 
cane farmland in the Everglades will drop considerably.  Far less tax 
money would be needed to buy up crop land and turn it back to the 
egrets, eagles, and alligators. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Big Sugar will scream that this is all terribly unfair.  Competition?  
Why, it's downright un-American!  Further, 420,000 American jobs will 
be lost, they claim, as the American sugar industry folds.  Actually, 
the USDA says that sugar farmers employ about 46,000 people 
nationwide, including perhaps 15,000 in Florida.  In any case, the 
sugar industry would hardly fold and the  government could use 
lowering our sugar import restrictions to pry open markets in other 
countries which would create American jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, both the House and the Senate have just thrown away 
chances to reduce or eliminate Big Sugar's protection.  That may have 
something to do with all the sweet green stuff the industry spreads 
around.  Together, the sugar cane, sugar beat and corn sweetener 
interests contributed almost $12 million to candidates for federal 
office from 1979 through 1994, according to the Washington-based 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if the Clinton Administration wants to do the right thing, there's 
still time to insist that the new farm legislation does so.  If only 
it can get over its belief that Big Government is the solution to a 
problem that Big Government's largesse to Big Sugar created in the 
first place.

<h2>
Procter & Gamble's Non-Fat Fat: Neither Satan Nor (Sigh) Savior 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Okay, so it wasn't Time magazine's &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; but it came 
awfully close, making the cover of the January 8, 1996 issue. The 
subject was Procter & Gamble's remarkable fat substitute olestra, to 
be marketed under the name Olean. It's been hailed as a powerful 
weapon in the battle of the increasingly bulging American bulge. It's 
also been portrayed as a death-dealing villain. It is neither. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Drug Administration has now approved olestra -- the first 
artificial fat available that can be used in the baking and frying 
process -- to be used in potato chips, taco chips, and crackers.  
Later P & G may request the FDA to approve it for use in such goodies 
as cakes, brownies, and french fries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to most taste-testers, to the tongue foods made with olestra 
are identical to those made with real fat.  But to the body, olestra 
may as well be Teflon, since it literally slides through the 
intestines without stopping off to visit arteries, hips, or 
waistlines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The FDA approved the fake fat over the objections of some scientists 
and consumer advocates, who warn that it has unusual risks.  Some 
studies have shown that as little as two ounces of olestra chips can 
act as a laxative. It can also cause other gastrointestinal 
difficulties including a condition called (forgive me; but science 
writers must sometimes be gross) &quot;anal leakage.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But as such it will hardly be alone among favorite foods.  One needn't 
be familiar with the famous scene in the movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; to 
know the effect that beans can have.  And if you eat more than a few 
prunes or other dried fruits at one sitting you may well find yourself 
doing several more sittings somewhere else. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any event, the FDA approval requires labeling the product to this 
effect.  My guess, though, is that the label will often be ignored by 
overzealous consumers -- though probably ignored only once. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More alarming is olestra's ability to wash out of the body certain 
nutrients believed important for preventing disease. While P&G will 
fortify olestra with vitamins A, D, E, and K, it will not add back a 
controversial class of nutrients known as carotenoids, which many 
believe protect against cancer.  P & G says evidence for that is 
lacking. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This nutrient depletion &quot;could potentially produce a large number of 
deaths annually and major morbidity in the U.S. population,&quot; Dr. Meir 
Stampfer of Harvard University wrote the FDA. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But P & G's agnostic position has repeatedly been boosted recently by 
one study after another finding that the Vitamin-A derivative beta 
carotene, a carotenoid, apparently provides  no cancer-fighting 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Institutes of Health in December told the FDA that nobody 
knows if depletions at the levels olestra causes would really harm 
anyone.  But certainly one factor that boosts P & G's position is that 
for the most part, olestra can only wash out whatever went in with it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Eat spinach and Pringle's potato chips together and you're going to 
lose the benefit of the spinach.  Alas, people are a lot more likely 
to combine the potato chips with dip and a beer or soda pop than with 
nutritious vegetables. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if olestra isn't the anti-Christ, it may not prove much of a 
savior, either. &quot;By replacing the fat in snacks, Olean can help 
millions of Americans cut excess fat and move closer to achieving an 
important dietary health goal,&quot; says P&G Chairman John Pepper.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'd say more like thousands, and here's why.  Americans have been 
hoodwinked into believing that anything that's fat free won't make 
them fat. They've bought tens of millions of books and videos from 
shysters like Susan (&quot;Stop the Insanity&quot;) Powter and Martin (&quot;The T-
Factor Diet&quot;) Katahn telling them exactly that. They so fervently want 
to believe it that they do. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But they're wrong.  Any energy consumed that is not burned off 
immediately becomes fat.  True, if you ate two ounces of potato chips 
cooked in olestra rather than fat, you'd have just 120 calories 
instead of 300.  For that matter, you could eat four ounces of olestra 
chips and still come out slightly ahead. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if Americans could stand to eat that few chips, they wouldn't need 
fat substitutes in the first place and we wouldn't be the fattest 
nation on the face of the earth. Overeating is our problem and 
olestra, far from curing it, will only encourage it among many people. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the experience with artificial sweeteners such as saccharin 
and aspartame (NutraSweet), which provide virtually no calories. Their 
use tripled in the 1980s and should have caused sugar consumption to 
decline and caloric intake to decline.  Instead even as artificial 
sweetener consumption has increased so has sugar intake, caloric 
intake, and Americans' waistlines.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That said, if you have the discipline to simply swap artificial 
sweeteners for sugar and don't tell yourself that a Diet Coke allows 
you to eat an extra piece of fried chicken, you can come out ahead of 
the game. Likewise, if you eat ten olestra potato chips instead of ten 
fat-fried potato chips, you win. It's a matter of free will and having 
the strength to exercise it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's why the FDA's decision was a good one. Government can protect 
us from dangerous substances, but government cannot protect us from 
ourselves.

<title>Fumento: The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane  -- 3/25/96</title>

<h2>
The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
A gunman bursts into the gymnasium of a small Scottish grade school.  
He begins firing, systematically hunting down nearly every child in 
the room.  Before he finishes and ends his own life with a blast to 
the brain, sixteen "wee ones" and their teacher lay dead in a huge, 
spreading pool of blood. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is an act of unmitigated evil.  Or is it?  Apparently it depends on 
whose newspapers you read. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I happened to be in Ireland at the time of the shooting, exposed to 
the coverage of the Irish and British press.  Every article I read, it 
seems, used the terms "monster," "pervert," and "evil" to describe the 
slayer, Thomas Hamilton.  There were some examples of this in the 
American media, as well. Time magazine's article included the words "a 
monster goes on the rampage" and Time essayist Lance Morrow focused on 
the element of evil.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But far more typical was this Associated Press line.  "A 43-year-old 
loner with an unsavory reputation massacred more than half of Dunblane 
Primary School's kindergarten class and its teacher on Wednesday, then 
shot himself dead."  Indeed, "loner" was the American media's chief 
descriptor of Hamilton. That's like summarizing George Washington as a 
man with a powedered wig or Abraham Lincoln as merely being tall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As to his "unsavory reputation," what the paper means is that he 
papered his walls with photos of little boys in various states of 
undress.  It means he was kicked out of the Boy Scouts for having 
little boys disrobe in front of him.  The kids called him "Mr. 
Creepie."  How do you get from this that he merely had an "unsavory 
reputation"? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The British media pulled no punches.  "Residents Say Scottish Killer 
Was Evil Pervert," ran the headline of the Reuters news service story 
out of Scotland.  "What has happened reminds us of the depths to which 
human evil can sink," concluded the London Evening Standard."  The 
London Daily Mirror referred to "evil Thomas Hamilton."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why has the American media been so reticent about calling this man 
what he is? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"At the foundation of all this is the Left's rejection of religion and 
fundamental to that is the question of whether human beings are 
capable of evil or not," says Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President of Toward 
Tradition and a radio talk show host in Seattle.  "The whole of 
western thought has always been based on the idea that there is evil 
of which people are [inherently] capable . . . " 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Left, he says, argues that since "no human beings capable of doing 
wrong things, evil must come from the institutions of society," 
usually but not always the church. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certaintly had this happened in the United States, the media would 
have done what they've  always done with shootings: blamed the 
institution of lax gun laws.  But because it happened in a nation with 
some of the strictest gun laws, they were  left foundering. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet,  the American media seem to  have trouble believing even some 
institutions can be evil.  These, after all, are the same people who 
to this day snort, chuckle, and guffaw when they refer to President 
Reagan's description of  the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."  As if 
there could possibly be a better term for a state that murdered tens 
of millions of people, kept hundreds of millions of others in bondage, 
and kept a nuclear arsenal trained on those whom it couldn't 
subjugate.  The British media, by contrast, treated and continues to 
treat Reagan's words with deference. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Royal, vice-president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., attributes the media's reticence to our having "made 
ourselves into such a therapeutic society that we don't like to think 
people have choices in right or wrong . . . .  If something goes wrong 
it's a sort of chemical malfunction, [and] people are not responsible 
for what they do." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Or a psychological malfunction, says the Rev. Robert Sirico, President 
of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty in Grand 
Rapids, Michigan.  The media "have to characterize in psychological 
terms, not moral ones.  Evil is just something we don't understand," 
he says. He adds that, "Morality is grounded in human free will," 
something else the media doesn't accept.  "If it turns out a child 
abuser was abused by his father, it exonerates him," he says.  "Since 
the media doesn't accept free will, it can't accept good or evil." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's "a very sophisticated amoral logic," he says.  But unlike true 
logic, it is ultimately incapable of explaining anything. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is what happens if you remove the concepts of good and evil. 
Without the context of the Civil War and slavery, Abraham Lincoln 
truly was only a president who happened to be tall; without the 
Revolutionary War and the Continental Congress and its aftermath, 
George Washington was just a president with a wig. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Call Thomas Hamilton anything you want--43 years old, a loner, fat, 
bald, bespectacled.  But if you don't call him evil, you're omitting  
what set him apart from the world's other five billion people that 
day.   As Time's Lance Morrow put it in the title of his essay, "Only 
the Vocabulary of Evil Could Explain What Happened at Dunblane."

Echoes of a Famine from 150 Years Ago
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>
GALWAY, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Grown men wept at the sight.  Women screamed and tore their hair.  
Some fainted.  For they knew that from Galway Bay to Dublin, from Cork 
to Belfast, death would soon stalk the land.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The event was the infestation of the Ireland's potato crop with "late 
blight." It was to spark the "Great Hunger," the 150th anniversary of 
which we mark this year.  Before it ended, a million Irish had died, 
and perhaps a million more had emigrated, and the future of Ireland -- 
and the United States, where most of the emigres landed -- would be 
forever changed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Botanists will tell you the famine was caused by the fungus 
Phytophthora infestans.  Yet wrong-headed government policies had at 
least as much to do with it.  As one Dubliner put it to me during my 
visit, "Where you see famine, politics must lie  just below the 
surface."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the famine, the Irish had been among the healthiest people in 
Europe.  Their usual daily diet was potatoes.  These comprised perhaps 
60 percent of the food for the people in general but close to 100 
percent for those in the poorer west and southwest regions of the 
country.  Potatoes could be grown economically even on the tiny 
parcels of land the Irish Catholics were allowed to cultivate. 
Further, they thrived even in the rocky, damp earth of the western 
part of the island.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The menu was monotonous but highly nutritious. If you ate enough -- 
and the Irish men ate as many as 14 pounds a day -- they supplied 
virtually every vitamin and nutrient your body needed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But in 1845, this godsend became a deadly liability.  That's when the 
late blight first appeared.  (Ironically, it could have been the 
result of importing a new strain of potato from America to make the 
current strain healthier.) The blight moved so quickly you could 
practically watch its progression, and in a matter of days a field 
would be destroyed.  Like a dark veil it spread across parts of 
continental Europe, then England, and then hopped across the Irish 
channel.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poor farmers watched in horror as their green field turned black and 
then began to give off a stench like putrefying flesh.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, in 1845 the blight only claimed about 60 percent of what would 
have been a bumper crop in Ireland.  Food in storage was enough to 
tide the population over for a year.  But when the late blight 
appeared again the next year, the stores had been exhausted and 
suffering would begin that the Irish to this day have not forgotten.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many people died from outright starvation.  Autopsies performed on the 
dead would find their bodies entirely devoid of food.  Many more, 
however, in their weakened state, succumbed to "famine fever," a 
general term describing illness from typhus, dysentery, and cholera.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reported the Cork Examiner of the poor in its community:
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Death is in every hovel; disease and famine, its dread precursors, 
have fastened on the young and old, the strong and the feeble, the 
mother  and the infant; whole families lie together on the damp floor, 
devoured by fever, without a human being to wet their burning lips or 
raise their languid heads; the husband dies by the side of the wife, 
and she knows not that he is beyond the reach of earthly suffering; 
the same rag covers the festering remains of mortality and the 
skeleton forms of their living, who are unconscious of the horrible 
contiguity; rats devour the corpse, and there is no energy among the 
living to scare them from their horrid banquet; fathers bury their 
children without a sigh, and cover them in shallow graves, round which 
no weeping mother, no sympathizing friends, are grouped; one scanty 
funeral is followed by another and another.  Without food or fuel, bed 
or bedding, whole families are shut up in naked hovels, dropping one 
by one into the arms of death.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the potato failure, much of this suffering was not inevitable.  
For just as was the case recently in Ethiopia and Somalia, crop 
failures play on a part in famines.  The rest comes from the failure 
of government.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ireland was at the time actually a part, albeit reluctantly so, of the 
wealthiest nation on earth, the United Kingdom.  But many in Britain 
loathed its people.  In those days before CNN, British papers often 
depicted  the Irish as slothful and stupid "bogtrotters."  British 
cartoonists depicted them as hairless apes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like today, the government promised much and delivered little.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of Ireland's produce was in grains, but these continued to leave 
port for English and other destinations.  Some food was imported, but 
then as today, powerful special interest groups prevailed upon the 
government to severely limit imports rather than to hurt their bottom 
lines. Then, as today, the government set up public works projects to 
provide pointless make-work jobs, building roads that began and ended 
nowhere and docks where no port would ever be.  Then, as today, people 
were huddled together in massive projects.  Often as not disease ended 
their stay.  (Today, it would be crime or drugs.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today the line, "We're from the government and we're here to help," 
has become a joke.  Back then, nobody laughed.  The hatred they 
developed has survived to this day and plays out in the bitter 
violence of the Irish Republican Army.  The combination of a deadly 
fungus and a deadly government policy continues to be lethal today, 
150 years later.

<h2> How the Media Reward Themselves for Dishonesty 
</h2>

When it comes to Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), the evidence keeps going in 
one direction and the media keep going in the other. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the most recent development, the Pentagon has just released its 
latest study.  It looked at almost 19,000 Gulf vets and found, once 
again, that aside from certain psychological problems there's no 
pattern of symptoms to suggest that "Gulf War Syndrome" means anything 
other than any sickness that happens to befall a Gulf vet. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

GWS is essentially a media creation.  Out of the 700,000 vets who 
served in the Gulf, a few began complaining of various but unrelated 
ailments.  Soon the media got ahold of it and pronounced this a 
mystery, as if out of 700,000 men and women after a period of a few 
years, none were supposed to be sick.  When soldiers read of this 
mystery "syndrome" they began assuming, in the way people do, that any 
illness they had was related to it.   At last count, their were over 
75 symptoms attributed to GWS, ranging from life-threatening ones like 
cancer and heart disease to lesser ones like weight loss and weight 
gain, graying hair, kidney stones, thick saliva, hot and cold flashes, 
increased urination, lightheadedness, sensitive teeth, hemorrhoids, 
and a "foot fungus that will not go away." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the symptoms are often connected to psychosomatic illness, 
such as joint pain, memory loss, and headaches.  Others, like semen 
that burns the skin, are as unsubstantiated as Elvis sightings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Every major study looking for a cause of GWS has found the same thing.  
There just ain't no such animal.  The first two of these came from the 
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and both 
found that other than psychiatric ills induced by stress, Gulf vets 
have no more illness than one would expect.  These studies were 
criticized somewhat for their methodology by the  National Academy of 
Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the media gaily repeated 
that criticism.  But in January the IOM itself concluded there was no 
such thing as GWS. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, the media continue to promote the story and to 
congratulate themselves for it.  Life magazine has just won the 1996 
John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism for 
its November cover story, "The Tiny Victims of Dessert Storm." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The article--which purported to discover a high rate of birth defects 
among children of Gulf War vets--was "a good, tough, moving look at a 
national tragedy," gushed contest judge Doug Balz, managing editor of 
the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine.  It worked "on both the heart and 
mind of the reader." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Again, with all those children born to 700,000 vets, you're going to 
have a certain number of problems.   But study after study has found 
no more problems than would be expected.  These include one from the  
Mississippi Department of Health of an alleged birth defect cluster, a 
larger study of 620 pregnancies at Robins Air Force Base, and a 
combined study of 6,392 pregnancies at several bases which found Gulf 
vets' wives' miscarriages at the same level as that population had 
before deployment to the Gulf.  It was also about half the civilian 
rate. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"I think it's unconscionable to frighten people out of reproducing 
unless you have some good data to support that contention," Dr. 
Russell Tarver, who led the Mississippi National Guard investigation, 
told me. "I think you're committing a crime against those veterans." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's what Life did.  It carefully ignored each of these studies.  
Instead it simply regaled its readers with touching anecdotes about 
children with birth defects whose parents had become convinced--by 
other stories like Life's--that being endowed with a perfect baby is a 
God-given right which was cruelly taken from them because of their 
service in the Gulf. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why do the media continue to ignore the evidence in favor of personal 
testimonials from people they themselves have terrified? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 "There's no question that the media tend to look at the negative side 
and the bad news more than the positive side and good news," Los 
Angeles Times news critic David Shaw told me.  "This is particularly 
true of medical problems and health issues because these are things 
about which the people worry the most. That's doubly true when 
children are involved. People tend to throw all skepticism out of the 
window." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Part of the problem, Shaw adds, is the "herd of independent minds" 
phenomenon.  Members of the press corps are loath to write anything 
that will make them seem odd.  "Reporters tend to be more likely to 
parrot the conventional wisdom," says Shaw.  "There's a premium to be 
paid for doing the story that goes against the grain."  And one to be 
gained for going with it, as the Life award shows. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But doesn't accuracy count?  Not usually. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the two years I was a judge at the Pulitzers I don't remember 
hearing anybody saying `Let's make phone calls'" to verify what's in a 
story, said Shaw.  I think the assumption is that if there were 
something wrong with the story the paper wouldn't be entering it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lately there's been a lot of hand-wringing from the media about why it 
seems the public hates them.  Why?  They reward dishonesty and 
incompetence with cover stories of major magazines.  Then they hand 
out awards for those stories.  Good people suffer as a result.  What's 
not to hate?  
<BR>

Latest  Scare is a  Tempest  in a Teapot    
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>

Where are those tea-heaving Boston patriots when you need them?  Iced    
tea around the country is turning up deadly and the best that can said    
about it is that the British -- already beset by "mad cow disease" --    
don't have to worry about it since they don't like iced tea anyway.    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
   
Well, actually no one has died from the tea.  Actually, no one has    
even gotten sick from it.  But that hasn't stopped the media from    
using such sound-bite headlines as "Killer Tea" and "Bad Brew."  Nor    
has it stopped major chains such as Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,    
Boston Market, Blimpie, and Taco Bell from dropping iced tea from    
their menus.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tempest in a teapot began back in the summer of 1994 when a    
restaurant customer in Cincinnati asked the local health department to    
test some tea with an "off" odor that had been served him at a    
restaurant.  The Cincinnati Health Department ran a fecal coliform    
test and then ran out to 20 other restaurants, rounded up their iced    
tea, and tested it all.  It found a modest level of fecal coliform    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Coliform in a water supply is a sign of possible harmful    
contamination, including the sometimes deadly bacteria E. coli, which    
caused the Jack in the Box deaths (from eating undercooked beef) three    
years ago.    
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But tea isn't water;  it comes from a plant and the leaves of that    
plant are naturally exposed to fecal bacteria from droppings of birds    
and other animals.  Bacteria has always been in tea isn't a warning    
sign of anything.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nonetheless,  a year later the Health Department released the names of    
the restaurants to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Since "enquiring minds    
want to know" the Enquirer ran a story titled "Iced Tea Worse than    
River," purportedly showing that "contamination is severe" in    
restaurant tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From Ohio the story spread to Kentucky, Georgia, and other states.     
Television station after station went out to local restaurants and    
brought back their iced tea for testing, and each reported in    
breathless horror that all or virtually all of the samples contained    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It apparently didn't occur or matter to them that if the tea were    
harmful there would have been a steady stream of sickened customers.     
In fact, deaths and illnesses of the iced tea epidemic continued to    
stand at zero.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)    
felt compelled to act, issuing an advisory stating, "Tea is a beverage    
with little history of disease transmission," and "At present, no    
outbreaks of infection have been reported to CDC that were clearly    
associated with the consumption of tea."  No outbreaks ever, out of    
nearly 10,000 investigations of food-borne illness over the past    
decade.  The CDC did take the opportunity to provide appropriate    
directions on safely brewing tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But this didn't satisfy the Associated Press (AP), which labeled the    
advisory a "warning" and asserted it was based on tests indicating    
"high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which can cause stomach upset    
and diarrhea."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

AP's report led to more than 140 news segments, almost all alarming.     
"Along with what makes your tea so tasty, you could be getting a    
strong dose of some nasty bacteria that could make you sick," a    
Miami/Ft. Lauderdale TV reporter warned. A Tampa/St. Petersburg    
station declared, "You might be drinking danger and not even know it."      
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A Los Angeles station consulted the expertise of the person on the    
street.  It quoted one iced tea drinker as being "shocked" while    
another said, "I think it's outrageous."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Meanwhile CNN co-anchor Katherine Calloway punctuated a news segment    
by saying, "I don't think I'll ever order iced tea in a restaurant    
again."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Some stations interviewed "experts" until they found somebody to agree    
with them.  "If one [bacterium] is present, it's too much," a    
University of Texas School of Public professor told a Houston station.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By February, the Wendy's chain had capitulated to the media-generated    
fear, suspending sales of the terrifying tea.  Perish the thought that    
the chain that pioneered a burger with three quarter-pound slabs of    
artery-choking, obesity-causing beef would sell its customers    
something that was bad for them.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I went to a Wendy's last night.  Virtually every food served is    
guaranteed to push you towards a quadruple-bypass.  You can feel your    
arteries harden just scanning the menu.  They ought to have a team of    
paramedics with a heart resuscitator standing by for anyone who orders    
the Big Bacon Classic Combo.  But iced tea remains banned.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody has gotten sick from drinking tea.        
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other fast-food chains are switching to individual bags of tea, which    
will contain the same bacteria but, hey, it's not safety but the    
appearance of safety that counts, right?    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I only wish I owned lots of stock in a soda pop company right now.

<h2>

The Strangling Vines of Regulation   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>

                
                       
     Even my most libertarian friends will admit to me in moments of weakness that there are
some government regulations they don't particularly mind.  My favorite is the one governing how
many rodent hairs or droppings can be in a jar of peanut butter.  And where would dumb sitcoms
be without a gag about the infamous prohibition against removing mattress tags?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The big problem with regulations is that they're the opposite of parties--more is definitely
not merrier.  And while somebody may or may not benefit from them, somebody always pays for
them.  Often enough, that somebody is all of us.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's the conclusion of two recently released papers from the Center for the Study of
American Business (CSAB) at Washington University in St. Louis.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The first, by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder, finds that government
regulations cost the U.S. economy $1.3 trillion a year in lost productivity. To give you an idea of
how much that is, if you took 1.3 trillion dollar bills and stacked them on top of each other they'd
reach--well, awfully damned high.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The second paper, by economist and CSAB Chairman Murray Weidenbaum, finds that the
companies that suffer most from regulation are medium-sized firms.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder notes in his report that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to
spend to put into effect government mandates.  But it's the indirect costs--in the form of reduced
productivity growth--that really clobber them.  Vedder says this means the economy only grows
at a rate of one percent per year, instead of the two percent it should.  If regulatory activity
remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. Gross Domestic Product would have been about $7.6
trillion.  Instead it was only $6.3 trillion.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That means lost jobs, jobs that never get created, and lower wages.  It means a drag on
the stock market so that mutual fund you're counting on to support you in geezerhood won't be
nearly as big as it would otherwise.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder says environmental regulations make up the lion's share of the costs, but he hasn't
done a breakdown to see exactly how much it is.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     "I will concede there could be benefits," to some regulations, Vedder told me.  Maybe
from lots of regulations.  "But the problem is we've abandoned the principle of moderation. 
There's diminishing returns with regulations as with anything."
     For example, he says, "The first billion spent on particulate matter [a cause of air
pollution] probably eliminates a lot, but maybe the tenth or 20th or 50 billionth reduces the
pollution by very small amounts.  The cost-benefit ratio turns negative at some point.  I would
suggest those severely diminishing returns had already set in probably over a generation ago and
we've been paying the price ever since."<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The point of Weidenbaum's study is that it's the nation's medium-sized businesses--not
the big multinationals like AT&T and IBM or the mom & pop operations that people are always
so concerned about--that bear the brunt of this regulatory onslaught.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's because the medium-sized firms fill out pretty much the same forms and meet the
same requirements as the big boys.  But the big boys have a lot more sales to show for their
troubles.  In fact, the costs of complying with regulations for companies with 20 to 499
employees averages over $5,000 per worker, says Weidenbaum, compared to just under $3,000
for companies with more than 500 employees.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As for the little businesses, everybody feels sorry for them, so they have lots of
exemptions.  A lot of  regulations only affect companies with 50 or more people.
     But don't think these companies don't suffer, too.  What happens if they're at 49
employees--and there are probably one heck of a lot of companies with 49 employees--and just
need to expand by a couple more?  Generally speaking, they don't.  It's too much of a headache.
     The answer, as Weidenbaum stresses, is not to raise the level at which the regulations kick
in.  Make the cut-off  75 employees and you're going to find an awful lot of companies with 74.
     Rather we need to re-evaluate our regulatory system completely.  We should start with the
perverse system of incentives we give regulators.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As it stands, if you're a environmental or health researcher and you don't discover a new
problem, you're probably not going to get your grant renewed.  So you make darned sure you
find a problem.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Then the government regulator hears about the newly discovered problem.  He has to
implement a regulation to reduce or prevent it or he's probably not going to keep being able to
justify his job.    <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's how it's possible to end up spending billions more each year on regulations with no
discernible increase in benefit to safety, health, or even aesthetics.  We need to clean house.  We
must subject current as well as proposed regulations to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, keeping in
mind that even beneficial regulations are a drag on the economy.  Just don't touch the one that
keep's Mickey Mouse's cousins out of my peanut butter.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>
Media at Loss for Words Over AIDS Decline
   
    </h2>

<P>

                
Ya know, it's getting so you can't trust anyone these days.  A few 
weeks ago, I was enthralled by the hit movie "Fargo," in part because 
its producers claimed that the tale of murder and mayhem in a small 
Minnesota town was based on a true story.  Only the names were 
changed, we were told, out of respect to the dead.  But there were no 
dead.  The movie was virtually a complete fabrication. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Maybe the movie's producers took their cues from the way the national 
media handles the news concerning AIDS.  Unlike "Fargo," there have 
been lots of deaths with AIDS. But as the latest yearly data just 
released from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) show, the epidemic that so recently was tagged as spiraling out 
of control is now fizzling. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, AIDS cases were down seven percent last year, from 79,897 to 
74,180. Great news, right?  Try "no news"--at least to most of the big 
boys in the media. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All three major TV network newscasts ignored the CDC's annual report, 
as did all three of the nation's major newsmagazines and most of the 
nation's major newspapers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Oh, sure, USA Today gave it a graphic comprising 69 words.  And the 
New York Times mentioned that new data existed, but only gave the 
numbers for New Jersey.  The Washington Post only gave it brief 
mention in an editorial. After all, we wouldn't want the nation's 
lawmakers to know that the disease they keep throwing more and more 
money at is on the decline, would we? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Contrast this with the coverage the media gave the epidemic in 1994, 
when cases greatly increased, albeit as the result of a statistical 
artifact resulting from the CDC expanding the definition of what 
constitutes an AIDS case.  Back then the New York Times's Lawrence 
Altman devoted a thousand words to the story, with the scary title 
"AIDS Cases Increase Among Heterosexuals."  Actually they "increased" 
among ALL groups, but what the hey? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yes, both USA Today and the Washington Post wrote the story up two 
years ago, as did the Los Angeles Times and all the other big guys. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is actually the second year in a row that AIDS cases have fallen, 
but it means a lot more this year.  That's because last year the data 
were still reflecting the shakeout from the new case definition.  The 
explosion of cases reported in 1994 led to a dearth in 1995.  But this 
year the decline is clearly real. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even those reporters who did deign to mention that the largest 
epidemic of the century was starting to implode nonetheless managed to 
put a PC slant on it.  Thus, Karen Hill's story for the Associated 
Press (AP) was sent out over the wires as "AIDS Rate Down Nationwide, 
But More Blacks, Women Infected."  The body of the story also 
indicated that there  is a "spread" of the disease among women. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In actuality, 123 FEWER adult or adolescent women were reported to 
have contracted AIDS in 1995 than the year before.  It's nice to know 
that even if your child never learns to add or subtract, he can always 
get a job with the nation's largest wire service. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If AIDS really were spreading among women, it sure would be hard to 
explain how births to women infected with the AIDS virus dropped 
dramatically from 957 to 730.  Many states didn't have a single baby 
born with AIDS.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about that heterosexual "explosion" the media loves to talk about?  
Actually, there was a drop of 500 cases in that category.  Even AP 
didn't try to mess with that number; instead, like everybody else, 
they just ignored it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about teenagers?  It wasn't long ago that the media were telling 
us that AIDS among teens would soon be more common than pimples.  But 
teen AIDS cases fell, too. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, in every way the AIDS epidemic has stubbornly refused to act 
like the media, the media's anointed "experts" and the government have 
said it would go.  It has steadfastly refused becoming a democratic 
disease, an "equal opportunity destroyer" as the nation's largest AIDS 
lobbying group once put it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead, the disease is more and more one of the marginalized in our 
society.  Blacks are about 12 percent of the population, yet they now 
contribute as many victims to the epidemic as do whites.  Hispanics 
also are grossly over-represented.  Broken down by risk factor, the 
vast majority of cases continue to come from homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
White heterosexuals, the "risk group" on which the media harp 
incessantly, made up two percent of all AIDS cases last year.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
None of this should be in the least surprising.  I predicted it nine 
years ago in my first science article.  I did so not by slaughtering a 
chicken and reading its entrails, but simply by consulting the 
publicly available data and interviewing the real experts. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The media and the government ignored these data and those experts, 
instead fabricating an epidemic of white, middle-class heterosexuals 
with false headlines, misleading statistics, and celebrity victims.  
This led to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars fighting 
non-existent fires while the real ones have raged on.

<title>Fumento: FDA Screwing Around With Device Approval - 5/30/96</title>

<h2>
             FDA SCREWING AROUND WITH DEVICE APPROVAL
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

</a>

<P>


Why is it that whenever the FDA quickly approves a drug or medical 
device, you always read about it in the first few pages of the 
newspaper, but when it delays approval of something that could prevent 
death and suffering, you usually only hear about it in the opinion 
pages--if at all? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Case in point: this column.  Subject: The FDA's delay in approving 
something called a pedicle screw to treat serious spinal injuries, a 
delay that is encouraging terrifically expensive litigation against 
the screws' manufacturers and making doctors hesitant to use them. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally pedicle screws were only used to fasten leg and arm bones, 
and the FDA approved them for this purpose.  But orthopedic surgeons 
found they were excellent for also fusing bones of the spine which had 
broken or degenerated.  There are other ways of doing this, such as 
wires, rods, or hooks, but once physicians tried the screws, the other 
techniques pretty much fell by the wayside. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA has never approved the screws for this express purpose.  
Nonetheless, FDA policy wisely allows a drug or device which has 
proven safe and effective for one thing to be used for another.  It's 
called "off-label" use.  Virtually everybody reading this column has 
probably received a drug or treatment that hadn't been approved for 
that specific purpose, yet doctors had decided it was a good thing to 
offer their patients. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example the class of drugs that includes Tagamet, Pepcid, and 
Zantac was originally  approved only for clinically-verified duodenal 
ulcers.  But long before the FDA approved their wider use, doctors 
found they were helpful for many types of stomach disorder and 
prescribed them as such.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So it has been with pedicle screws used for spinal bone fusion.  Over 
300,000 times, doctors have used these on patients' back bones, in the 
belief that it was the best treatment.  But, of course, operations 
don't always accomplish their intended end; even the simplest.  I am 
now facing my third surgery to have a painful inflamed section of 
nerve removed from my foot.  Against all odds, the damned thing just 
keeps growing back--and believe me, being a freak of nature isn't all 
it's cracked up to be.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just so, not all patients who have pedicle screws used on their back 
receive complete relief.  Sometimes it's the doctor's fault and 
sometimes that's just the way it is.  But in this litigation-happy 
country, nothing ever "just happens."  Somebody had to pay and pay 
dearly, and that's where the trial lawyers come in. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
About 7,000 patients who have received spinal treatment with pedicle 
screws have filed suits with an estimated total liability of $1 
billion.  Their lawyers' chief weapon: That the FDA has been steadily 
dragging its feet on the approval of the technique.  You can just hear 
the plaintiff's lawyer booming at the doctor on the witness stand: 
"You mean to tell us that you inserted these screws even though you 
knew for a fact that the FDA has not approved them for that purpose!" 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The best answer to that is: "Yeah, but so what?"  But you can see how 
an uninformed jury might feel otherwise.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA approval of pedicle screws for use on the spine would "take the 
wind right out of the trial lawyers' sails," one industry insider told 
me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Way back in 1994 an FDA panel of medical experts voted unanimously to 
ease regulations on the use of the screw.  And the 1995 FDA proposal 
itself says, "The data demonstrate that the use of pedicle screw-based 
instrumentation [on spinal degeneration and fractures] results in 
significantly higher rates when compared with treatment with no 
instrumentation or with currently available . . . devices." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, the trial lawyers are desperate to see the screws remain 
unapproved and have enlisted the lobbying and legal support of Sidney 
Wolfe's Public Citizen advocacy group, which often works hand-in-hand 
with plaintiffs' lawyers.  Yet not only is the FDA dragging its feet 
on granting approval (except for one extremely rare form of back 
surgery), one of its top officials has actually sabotaged the case for 
approval. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The sabotage arose out of something generally called the Cohort Study, 
a major evaluation published in the medical journal Spine which 
concluded that pedicle screws were at least as safe and more effective 
than previous methods of treatment.    
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As such, the study is devastating to the trial lawyers' position, 
prompting their typical reaction of trying to intimidate and harass 
the doctors who worked on the study.  The FDA knows about this tactic 
and so flatly told the lawyers it would not release the names.  But 
FDA Deputy Associate Commissioner Mitch Zeller  nonetheless turned the 
names over to a group associated with the trial lawyers.  He says he 
did so accidentally, not having noticed that they were marked as 
confidential.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Joseph Barton (D-TX), claims Zeller isn't telling the truth and 
is demanding that the Justice Department investigate.  In the 
meantime, subpoenas issued to doctors who worked on the Cohort Study 
have risen nearly five-fold since their names were released. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA Commissioner David Kessler has apologized for the release, but has 
rushed to his employee's side in saying it was inadvertent.  Barton is 
right; that's a question for Janet Reno, not David Kessler to answer.  
In the meantime, the way for the FDA to undo some of the damage is to 
give its approval to pedicle screws for spinal use.  Get a backbone, 
commissioner, and do what's right.

<h3>EPA'S OWN PANEL SAYS IT<br> MASQUERADES DIOXIN POLICY AS SCIENCE</h3>  

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr> 
You probably don't remember when the EPA released its report on dioxin in September in the same way you remember, say, when JFK was shot or O.J. took his ride in the Ford Bronco. But the headlines might ring a bell:  "Dioxin Pollution Risks 'Worse than Feared,'" "Toxicity of Times Beach 'No Longer in Doubt,'" "Dioxin Scare is Real."<p>
Here's the catch.<p>
The EPA report was just a draft.  As in: "not the one that counts."  As such, it had yet to be evaluated by the agency's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  Now that board has rejected the conclusions that led to those scary headlines and sent the report back to the agency for a rewrite.<p>
Alas, no headlines this time. No, not a single major newspaper (or minor one that I'm aware of) ran a news story on the SAB decision, though Science magazine gave it a short write-up ("Panel Slams EPA's Dioxin Analysis") and there were a few editorials and op-eds.<p>
For 15 years now, the EPA has pursued a vendetta against dioxin, a by-product of paper bleaching, and of incineration of certain materials.  Until it was banned as such, it was also a by-product in the 
manufacturing of some herbicides, including the notorious Agent Orange.<p>
Ever since the chemical was found to be horribly toxic to guinea pigs -- albeit far less so to every other animal species tested, including other rodents -- the EPA and other environmental organizations have 
relentlessly attacked it as they have no other chemical save the pesticide DDT.<p>
Fear of dioxin contamination led to the evacuation of Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, and to telling Vietnam vets that they may be at extraordinary risk of disease.<p>
As a member of the class of chemicals called organochlorines, dioxin has become a cornerstone of Greenpeace's and other groups' efforts to ban all synthetic organochlorines -- a ban that would cripple the economy.<p>
The purpose of the EPA draft report was to show that this vendetta had been justified.  In addition to the old charge of dioxin being a possible human carcinogen -- causing as many as one in 1,000 human 
cancers -- the EPA added two newer charges: that it might affect human children in the womb and that it could compromise immune systems at levels approaching those to which Americans are currently exposed.<p>
While those human exposure levels are infinitesimal compared to our exposure to so many other chemicals, the EPA maintained that what causes illness in some animals at huge doses must also cause sickness in humans at tiny ones. Predictably it prompted such headlines such as "EPA:  Dioxin Exposure is Risky for People, Too."<p>
But several scientists at the meeting challenged the EPA's assumption, used in all its policy-making that there is no threshold below which a harmful chemical causes no harm. One was the University of Wisconsin's Alan Poland, widely known for his discovery of the "dioxin receptor," the molecule in cells to which dioxin must bind before it produces any affects.  He said 150 years of science contradicted the EPA no-threshold position.  Regarding dioxin, Poland said the normal level to which Americans are 
exposed -- four molecules of dioxin per cell -- is far below the number required to have an effect, considering that there are about 10,000 receptor molecules per cell.<p>
One EPA official complained to me that the board meeting had unfairly been characterized as negative. In fact, he said, the only problems the SAB found were with the ninth chapter. Of the first eight, it was highly complimentary.<p>
But that's just the point.  The first eight chapters were written by scientists outside of the EPA.  Only the last chapter, the conclusive one, the one from which EPA was to draw its regulatory policy and from 
which the media drew the headlines -- that was the one written by the EPA itself.
In that chapter, said Poland at the meeting, "policy masquerades as science."<p>
"This is probably the best data set that the EPA will see in my lifetime," Poland added.  "Yet, despite all of that, the first eight chapters are thrown away."<p>
Board members repeatedly accused the EPA of picking and choosing its data.  For example, the largest, most-heavily studied group of persons with known high exposure to dioxin were the members of Operation Ranch Hand, the men who did the actual spraying of Agent Orange on the jungles of South Vietnam. (Their motto: "Only you can prevent forests.") The EPA report duly noted any possible minor abnormality in this group.  But it neglected to say the Ranch Handers were strapping specimens of healthy humanity.<p>
"The EPA didn't mention that there were no more cancers than would be expected, no affects on the immune and nervous systems, no increase in deaths, and no increased birth defects in their children." SAB member and Office of Technology Assessment official Michael Gough told me.  "They mentioned nothing that didn't serve their purpose."<p>
One SAB member,  Dr. Knute Ringen of the Center to Protect Workers' Rights in Washington, D.C., concluded: "I think that the agency has pretty much come to the end of the line with regard to producing 
useful decision-making information on dioxin, and that it's time to go on to something else."<p>
But the EPA's dogged obsession with justifying its dioxin policy will not end -- unless, that is, Congress finally pulls the purse strings shut.<p>

<title>Disability Act</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Disability Act Cripples Small Businesses</h2> 
</center>
<hr>
<b>Michael Fumento</b>
<p>
<p>
A Harris poll shows that 90 percent of business executives surveyed support the enforcement provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Well, you know people who claim everything big business says is a lie?  This time they may be onto something. 
<p>
One wonders, for example, if the Coca-Cola company was polled.  Two  years ago, a Coca-Cola executive got drunk at a company party and  threatened a co-worker.  The company fired him and he sued, because  under the ADA alcoholism is a disability.  Coca-Cola claimed they didn't fire him over the "disability," but over the threatening  
behavior--there being as yet no federal protection for such people.  A  jury disagreed and handed our soft drink sot over $1 million in lost wages and $6 million in punitive damages.  He won't get it all, since the ADA limits punitive damages to $300,000 for big businesses, but it wasn't for want of trying.  
<p>
And how about Exxon, which--after a certain accident off the coast of  
Alaska--began cracking down on employees in dangerous jobs who imbibe.   
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees  
enforcement of the ADA, is suing them for it. 
<p>
Yes, under the ADA, behavior which society used to condemn can now be handsomely rewarded.  
<p>
Under the ADA, which took effect in 1992, businesses with 15 or more employees are forbidden from discriminating in hiring, firing, or promotions on the basis of a disability.  In addition, businesses catering to the public such as theaters, stores, and restaurants must  make their facilities highly accessible to disabled persons in terms of getting in, using the bathroom, and getting around. 
<p>
No one yet knows how wide the definition of "disabled" will end up. It certainly is wide enough to include the obese.  But to qualify you have to be really, really fat.  If you just have a pot belly or thunder thighs you've got a lot of hard eating in front of you. 
 
Traditional disabilities are far outnumbered by this new breed.  According to the National Organization on Disability, which commissioned the business poll, there are 49 million disabled  Americans at any one time.  (And naturally it represents the wishes of  all of them.)  Of these, fewer than 2 percent are in wheelchairs. 
<p>
Of complaints filed under the ADA, as of the end of March only 7.3% had anything to do with disabilities of the extremities such as paralysis or missing limbs.  Blindness and deafness accounted for 6  percent of complaints.  Back pain, conversely, made up almost a fifth  of all cases while emotional and psychiatric impairments were 11.6  
percent. 
<p>
So much for the imagery of the Vietnam vet in a wheelchair. 
<p>
No, under the ADA, we may not all get our 15 minutes of fame, but by  golly we all get a grab at the brass ring of disability. Still, big business has learned to stop worrying and love the ADA, says the poll. 
<p>
Don't believe it.  People often tell pollsters what they think they should say rather than what they really believe.  That's why polls showed California's anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 headed for certain defeat just days before it easily passed.  
<p>
Yet at least those were anonymous polls.  There was nothing anonymous here.  Guarantees of confidentiality notwithstanding, no CEO in his right mind would want to be listed somewhere as disapproving of an act which everybody thinks is supposed to help Stevie Wonder and Jerry's Kids. 
<p>
Had Harris polled small businesses, the response might have been more
straightforward. That's because a single lawsuit can hurt a small business so much more. 
<p>
True, under the ADA businesses with fewer than 50 employees can lose no more than $50,000 in punitive damages.  But, "the typical small business owner takes home less than $40,000 a year, so basically it means the business, the house, the car, and then some," explains Wendy Lechner of the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 
<p>
Moreover, Lechner told me, "The  litigation can cost more than the damages [settlement or award] and that is what frightens" small  businesses. For a company like Coca Cola a few hundred thousand  dollars in litigation costs doesn't amount to cola beans.  For Charlie  Chan's Chinese takeout, it means their goose could be cooked even if they win. 
<p>
The public access section of the ADA also slams small businesses particularly hard.  An article in the current issue of Reason magazine by Brian Doherty details the nightmare odyssey of a Denver restaurant owner who ended up needlessly paying over $100,000 in construction costs and fees to make his business comply.  
<p>
Fines aside, small business owners are terrified of bad publicity.  Lechner spoke of a  Tennessee woman who rented space for her business in a local mall.  A local activist group demanded she make her store more accessible to wheelchairs and she agreed but added that by contract she needed to wait until the mall owner arrived back in the country.  Not good enough.  Soon the story of this heartless
businesswoman was everywhere. "She feels she may not recover for years  because 
it was all over the papers," says Lechner. 
<p>
If our congressional representatives were to conduct an informal poll  of some of their own small-business owning constituents, they'd  probably hear something a lot different than what millionaire chief  executives told the Harris people.  They'd probably hear that the ADA needs to be scrapped--or at least severely disabled.

<title>Fumento: The Media's Militia Hate-Fest -- 8/8/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 8, 1996</i><br>
<h2>The Media's Militia Hate-Fest</h2>
You've got to hand it to those braniacs in the media. Almost before 
the blast of the Olympic bombing stopped ringing in our hears, they 
knew whodunnit. Actually, it was a simple deduction for them.  The 
person who phoned in the warning had an American, white-sounding 
voice; therefore it was (ominous music, please) THE MILITIA! <p>

Now, now, don't pay any attention to the talk about this loner 
security guard with the hero complex.  The media had its men long ago. <p>

Here's how the Associated Press (AP) began a story. "The bomber who 
brought terror to the Olympics was a white male, may not have worked 
alone and may have shared militia groups' hatred of international 
organizations." <p>

Of course, this means he just as easily could have worked alone and 
despised militia groups almost as much as, say, the media do. But 
that's not the way AP wanted to slant it. <p>

Then there was the headline: "Two Militia Members Potential Suspects 
in Olympics Blast." <p>

"Potential" here serves the same purpose as "may" in the AP story. It 
takes nothing and makes it seem like something. Heck, as an American 
male with a white-sounding voice  (not to mention one who was trained 
to blow things up in the Army) I could have been a potential suspect.  
(I hope I don't get a call from the FBI now.) <p>

When I did a search of the Nexis computer data base of newspapers, 
magazines, and TV news shows and plugged in the key words "militia," 
"Olympic," and "bomb," I found no fewer than 343 articles containing 
those terms! <p>

Granted, a couple of those pieces actually said there was no reason to 
suspect the militia.  But most of the rest bent over backwards, 
sideways, and at any odd angle to try to tie these things together. <p>

Why? <p>

"With the Oklahoma City bombing, there were 36 hours in which it was 
Middle Eastern terrorists," David Kopel, research director of the 
Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado reminded me. "It's the same 
human instinct to rush to judgment against whoever is the modern hate 
object." <p>

Says Kopel, "A lot of what the media thrives on is conflicts of good 
versus evil.  What they put into the `evil' box varies with sociology 
of the times.  In the 1910s it would have been anarchists; in the 
1930s it would have been sex-crazed Negroes on marijuana.  Now it's 
the tobacco industry and gun owners." <p>

So part of the reason the media hate the militia is because they have 
guns.  (God help them if they also smoke.)  But certainly another 
factor is the media fear what they don't understand.  Since they are 
so enamored of big government, they can't possibly comprehend the 
thinking of people so very mistrustful of big government.  Indeed, 
it's safe to say that many militia members are downright paranoid, but 
that's hardly illegal and hardly a characteristic of only militia 
groups. <p>

Further, both the media and the public have a misconception of the 
militia because the only time you hear of them, they've done something 
wrong, be it stockpiling illegal weapons or refusing to pay taxes. 
But, says Kopel, focusing on criminals on the fringe of the militia 
movement, "Is no more fair than saying that the cops who beat up 
Rodney King are representative of police throughout the country." <p>

Finally, the pot is being stirred by groups which make their living by 
making you think all militia members are white boys who wear pointed 
white hoods or greet each other with "Heil Hitler!" instead of 
"Hello!" (Never mind that the leader of one of the largest militia 
units, J.J. Johnson of Ohio, is black and that he's called the media 
attempts to identify the militia with racism as "drive-by 
journalism.") <p>

One such group is the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), which as I 
documented in a July 8 Wall Street Journal article basically 
fabricated the "epidemic" of black church burnings.  Depending on the 
gullibility of the reporter, the CDR will say there are anywhere from 
50,000 to 200,000 militia members and allies, though a 1995 Anti-
Defamation League report put the figure at 15,000. <p>

Another militia-baiting group is the Southern Poverty Law Center, 
headed by Morris Dees.  The Atlanta bombing, he suggested to wide-eyed 
reporters, might be a militia effort to "disrupt the one-world 
movement." <p>

It probably never occurred to most of us, militia included, that the 
modern Olympic games--now a century old--were part of any one-world 
movement, instead of a forum for athletes to glorify their countries 
and earn fat endorsement contracts. <p>

 But Dees profits handsomely from spreading hysteria. According to an 
August 3 USA Today story, his group has now amassed a fortune of $68 
million, even while other civil rights groups are going broke. <p>

"Morris Dees is an effective, demagogic hatemonger who's using his 
immense talents to get rich by making Americans afraid of each other," 
says Kopel. "He's a fraud who has milked a lot of very wonderful, 
well-intentioned people," Stephen Bright of Atlanta's Southern Center 
for Human Rights told USA Today. <p>

Says Kopel, "If the militia hadn't come along, Dees and the CDR would 
have had to invent them, and they have indeed invented what they mean 
to a lot of people." <p>

That includes virtually the entire U.S. media. Now if they can only 
find a way to blame the downing of TWA Flight 800 on a small band of 
militia in Idaho . . .  <p>

<title>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</title>

<h2>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</h2>


By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
It seems that when it comes to weight-loss products, the expression 
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" just doesn't have 
meaning.  So it has been with the so-called "miracle anti-fat pill," 
which isn't a pill, isn't a miracle, and has "hype" written all over 
it.
<p>
Recent studies in Science magazine have claimed synthesized high doses 
of a naturally-occurring hormone, called leptin, caused mice to go 
from Jackie Gleason to Art Carney in a matter of weeks. This has 
sparked a celebration in various media outlets.  The St. Petersburg 
(Florida) Times, the most-read newspaper in one of the fattest parts 
of the country, gushed, "Just think: You could gorge yourself on ice 
cream, potato chips, tacos . . . . Then just pop a miracle pill, and 
your worries are over . . . . The world would be couch-potato heaven."  
<p>
Ah . . .  Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow there's a drug, 
right?
<p>
Reality check.
<p>
The first little problem with leptin is that the "pill" is actually 
injections, possibly daily, for life.
<p>
No big deal?  Ask any insulin-dependent diabetic.  The difference 
between leanness and simple obesity (obesity is usually defined as 
being 20% over ideal weight) is about the equivalent of a McDonald's 
Big Mac.  Probably few of us would cherish trading sandwiches for 
shots.
<p>
Then there's the efficacy issue. Leptin works wonders on rotund 
rodents and no doubt Mickey will soon have heard the last of Minnie's 
teasing about his "beer cheese belly." But mice are not small men.  
Medical literature is replete with instances of drugs that cured or 
killed rodents yet had no effect on humans.
<p>
Recent research by Dr. Jos Caro and others at Thomas Jefferson 
Medical Center in Philadelphia, including a study in the June Journal 
of Clinical Investigation, has found that obese people actually 
already have far higher levels of leptin than do lean ones.  This 
could mean that leptin is useless as a weight regulator in humans.  
Or, as Dr. Caro told me, the situation could be like Type II diabetes, 
in which sufferers have high levels of insulin but are resistant to 
its effects and therefore must be given much more insulin.
<p>
Maybe a massive dose of leptin would work on obese humans, says Dr. 
Caro. "But that is an optimistic view. It may also not work."    
<p>
Then there's safety.  We don't know yet how safe large leptin 
infusions are for mice, much less humans.
<p>
What all this means is that the two-year timeline some reporters have 
suggested for general use of the drug is laughable.  Five is more like 
it, and perhaps far more.  
<p>
Assuming leptin even worked perfectly, there would still be the 
problem that obesity is often just the most obvious indicator of the 
physical harm on ourselves by overeating and underexercising.  Leptin 
won't strengthen the lungs, heart, and other muscles grown soft 
through too many hours of watching Home Improvement and Roseanne.  It 
won't lower cholesterol levels. It won't prevent colon cancer and 
other malignancies linked to a bad diet.
<p>
And then there's another kind of harm for which obesity is merely a 
marker, the mental attitude that's led to the obesity epidemic.
<p>
Despite the other obesity hype we've been hearing lately, that of "fat 
genes," genes cannot explain the waistline explosion of the last two 
decades that has made a third of us obese and as many as three-fourths 
of us overweight.  Genes cannot explain why Americans of European 
descent weigh so much more than do Europeans, making the land of the 
free also the land of the fattest people on earth.
<p>
Yes, there is evidence that some human obesity is genetic, and if some 
300 pounder insists he sustains his weight on a turnip a day, I won't 
argue.  But most fat people are only lying to themselves when they 
blame their ancestors.
<p>
One better object of blame is a culture that encourages overeating and 
underexertion. Another is ourselves.
<p>
It used to be that concepts like "self-restraint," "delayed 
gratification," "self-denial" and "all things in moderation" were 
indicative of building character.  Now they have become quaint.
<p>
Tell an overweight American he should eat less and exert himself more 
and you're likely to get the same incredulous response you'd get if 
you told a welfare mother with seven children by six men that human 
beings should not behave like rabbits.
<p>
Gluttony isn't called one of the seven deadly sins because it can 
spoil your looks in a bikini, but rather because of its impact on the 
spirit.  But Americans don't want to hear about that sin or any other.
<p>
Instead, we want to indulge, and we don't want to bulge.  So we spend 
billions of dollars a year chasing after fad diets, false prophets, 
anti-cellulite salves, pills, foods, drinks, and exercise equipment 
guaranteed to effortlessly burn off gazillions of calories. We buy 
books and videos from screaming women with blonde crewcuts, and 
purchase cream promising to magically drain the fat from our thighs.
<p>
 Sure, no miracle cure has worked yet, but the next one just might. 
Anything's better than a little self-discipline, a little denial.  And 
who knows, maybe the next promised miracle will really pan out.  Maybe 
leptin will.
<p>
Yes, some day we may all be able to walk around in a glorious leptin 
lethargy with feedbags on one end and bags like they sling under 
parade horses on the other end.  
<p>
But alas, what truly ails this nation no drug is going to cure.

<title>GULF WAR SYNDROME: SON OF AGENT ORANGE</title>
</head>

<hr><center><h2>Gulf War Syndrome:  Son of Agent Orange</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Yet another scientific study has found no evidence that Gulf War 
Syndrome (GWS) is anything other than a broad tag applied to any 
illness found in any Gulf Vet. But those who deny the evidence remain 
undaunted. After all, says Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, it 
took 20 years for the government to conclude that Agent Orange, a 
defoliant used on the jungles of South Vietnam, caused severe health 
problems in vets. Now the government liberally doles out payments to 
Vietnam vets with any number of diseases it claims have been linked to 
Agent Orange.
<p>
Indeed, the cry of "It's Agent Orange all over again!" has become the 
"Remember the Maine!" slogan of the GWS alarmists.  And they're right, 
but not in the way they would have us believe.
<p>
Both then and now there were wild, unsubstantiated tales of exposure.  
With Agent Orange, soldiers complained of being drenched with an 
orange-colored powder or liquid from the sky.  But the name comes from 
the color of the containing barrels. Agent Orange is clear and always 
a liquid. With GWS we hear of soldiers absolutely convinced they were 
hit by poison gas, even though during the whole of the war not one was 
ever treated for such exposure.  
<p>
Then and now there were wild rumors of miscarriage and birth defects 
among offspring of vets.  One case we keep hearing about is an alleged 
cluster of birth defects among National Guard families in Mississippi.  
But a health department investigation showed no more birth defects in 
that group than normal.  Wider studies have shown the same thing for 
both the offspring of Vietnam and Gulf War vets.  No study has ever 
shown them to have more birth defects or more miscarriages than vets 
who didn't go to war.
<p>
Then and now any symptom any vet got was blamed on the alleged 
illness. More than 75 symptoms have been attributed to GWS, ranging 
from bleeding gums to aching joints to graying hair to weight gain to 
heart disease. Even malaria and herpes have been attributed to GWS, 
though previously these were thought to have been spread by mosquitoes 
and sex.  If you have chronic back pains and didn't go to the Gulf, 
it's just chronic back pain. If you went, it's Gulf War Syndrome.
<p>
Then and now vets who got cancer automatically blamed it on the 
offending agent, as if vets who serve in wars are never supposed to 
get the disease. But one out of four Americans will eventually 
contract cancer.  Studies on Vietnam vets showed that they had no more 
cancers than among vets who didn't go to war, and the same has held 
true of Gulf War vets.
<p>
An on-going study of military personnel who actually did the Agent 
Orange spraying and who received far greater exposure than did ground 
troops indicates they are just as healthy as counterparts who received 
no Agent Orange exposure.
<p>
The same is true of studies of Gulf vets. The only illnesses they have 
to a greater degree than soldiers who didn't go to the Gulf are 
psychologically-related. These may be very real and debilitating, but 
they weren't caused by anything in the Gulf itself.  The prime cause, 
ironically, is probably being told they are being ravaged by a mystery 
illness.  Doctors have long known that if you tell people they are 
ill, they'll start sprouting numerous symptoms completely unrelated to 
their actual illness.
<p>
Then and now no purported link between illness and the alleged cause 
is considered too ludicrous. The first famous Agent Orange victim, 
Paul Reutersham, who died of cancer, was by his own admission 
completely enclosed in a supply helicopter at the time the area he was 
in was being sprayed.
<p>
The most reported-on death from GWS is Michael Adcock.  His mother 
claims a gas-laden Scud missile had exploded nearby 24 hours before 
her son developed his first cancer symptom. But cancers such as his 
usually take decades to develop and no cancer manifests itself in 
anything near 24 hours.
<p>
Then and now  the hysteria was driven by veterans lobbyists (most 
prominently the American Legion), by congressmen who opposed the war 
in question and who leap at any excuse to spend other people's money 
to show their compassion, by a media far more interested in selling 
terror than telling the truth, and (of course) lawyers.
<p>
Then and now, science was openly disavowed. In 1990, a veterans 
lobbyist said of Agent Orange, "we must now presume that the 
scientific community cannot be trusted [and] a political decision must 
be made on this issue to provide compensation to veterans."  In 1995 
President Clinton  leapfrogged over the heads of scientists in 
establishing a political panel to review GWS evidence, with Hillary 
Clinton serving as the Administration's point person on the issue.
<p>
Then and now, to question the causation-disease link was to be accused 
of being heartless and unpatriotic, as if it is compassionate and 
patriotic to mislead healthy people into believing they--and their 
wives and children--live under the shadow of a terrible disease.
<p>
Yes, then and now, vets have truly suffered, but not from any exposure 
they received during wartime. Rather it is exposure to those who claim 
to be their friends and allies that has caused their terror and even 
some of their symptoms.  With friends like those, who needs Ho Chi 
Minh and Saddam Hussein?

<title>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</title>

<center><h2>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Picture a car salesman screaming at you from the television.  "My plan 
will save you billions, BILLIONS, in tax dollars by taking student 
loans away from the banks and cutting out the middleman's profits! But 
there's more! Students will save money, too, because I'm offering them 
lo-lo E-Z payments! I must be crazy to offer such a deal!  That's why 
they call me Crazy Billy!"
<p>
That, if you pardon a wee bit of rhetorical flourish, was President 
Bill Clinton of two years ago. And his pitch worked, as Congress 
enacted his student loan direct lending program.
<p>
And as is so often the case, the vehicle that on the lot looked so 
pretty has turned out to be little more than a bucket of bolts.
<p>
The timing on the direct loan scheme couldn't have been more ironic. 
At a time when former Soviet republics were privatizing everything in 
sight, our government was nationalizing a major industry. Still, two 
government studies, one by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and 
the other by the General Accounting Office, did calculate that direct 
lending could save money, about $4 billion over the next four years.  
The Clinton Administration made things look sweeter by arbitrarily 
doubling that to $8 billion.  What's a measly $4 billion among 
friends, right?
<p>
A pilot direct-loan program was already in the works, but in the 
atmosphere of arrogance that characterized those early Clinton months, 
the Administration decided there was no need to wait.
<p>
Now even government agencies are saying that this act of reinventing 
government is closer to reinventing the Edsel.
<p>
A new CBO study has actually reversed that agency's position and 
concluded that the best way for government to save money with direct 
lending is to scrap it.  This could save taxpayers $1.5 billion over 
the next seven years.
<p>
The reason for CBO's about face is that its original report compared 
the administrative costs of only a year of the direct lending scheme 
with the full administrative costs of the guaranteed student loan 
system.  When Congress directed the CBO to compare both programs on an 
equal footing, it became clear the result was a jump in government 
spending.
<p>
A new Congressional Research Service report also concludes that the 
Administration was not calculating fully the cost of taking over the 
administration of the program.
<p>
Also a fraud is the part of Crazy Billy's plan which was to help 
students, the E-Z payment part. All it actually does is to stretch out 
payments, the oldest trick in the car salesman's repertoire.  
Currently, students are given 10 years to repay, while under direct 
lending it's 25.  Sure, payments are lower.  But at the end of the 25-
year period a student borrowing the maximum amount allowed, $88,000, 
would end up paying back $167,723 in interest and principle instead of 
$128,400 under the existing plan.
<p>
Moreover you would also have students paying off  their college loans 
even as their own children were going off to college. Instead of a 
chicken in every pot, Clinton's promise is two generations of student 
loans in every family.
<p>
But there's one huge difference between Crazy Billy and other used car 
salesmen.  No one forces you to buy from a used car lot.
<p>
Crazy Billy says he won't force anyone to buy his plan, either.   
Repeatedly he's stated that direct government lending will be a matter 
of choice for schools.  As late as April of this year he spoke of 
making "the student loan program available to all the schools on a 
voluntary basis . . . "
<p>
Yet Clinton's current budget proposal indicates that all colleges and 
universities will be in the program by 1997-98.  Education Secretary 
William Riley has affirmed in a letter to Tennessee Democratic 
Representative Bart Gordon, a direct lending opponent, that under the 
presidents's plan, by the 1997-98 school year "all schools would be 
required to participate."
<p>
So much for "voluntary."
<p>
The obvious reason for this conscription is the same as for any--that 
volunteerism isn't working.  While the law allows up to 40% of loan 
volume by 1995-96, recent reports from the GAO and the Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial Assistance state that direct lending 
participation will actually be around 30%.  Far from flocking to join 
the program, institutions have been scrambling to get out.  Earlier 
this year the GAO stated that 104 institutions have abandoned their 
Crazy Billy direct lending vehicle by the side of the road. 
<p>
Yet while legitimate four- and two-year institutions have been 
steering clear of the government program, it has become a haven for 
hundreds of high-default trade schools with questionable credentials.  
Almost half the direct loans are to students of trade schools, with a 
third of all loans going to students of barber or beauty academies.  
The default rate for student loans from trade schools averages 30%, 
compared with only 7% for four-year colleges.  For all his trouble in 
taking over the student loan program, Uncle Sam is going to get stuck 
holding a lot of useless notes.
<p>
A recent poll sponsored by direct lending opponents indicates that 
almost three-fourths of the public believes that the pre-Clinton 
system of private industry making loans which the government 
guarantees is better than the Clinton program. Congress should tell 
Crazy Billy that taxpayers aren't the tire-kicking yahoos he thinks we 
are and that we want direct lending sent to the junk yard.

Pesticides, those much maligned chemicals, can be wonderful things. 
Likewise for fertilizer, when it's not being used to blow up federal 
buildings.  They are both important tools in making the U.S. the best-
fed nation in the world, and in feeding tens of millions of citizens 
of other nations.<p>
But, as they say, you can have too much of a good thing. Agricultural 
run-off from these products are the biggest cause of waterway 
pollution in this country. Pesticides, which are primarily herbicides, 
can kill plants downstream.  Fertilizer run-off makes other plants 
grow at extraordinary rates. Together, fertilizers and pesticides can 
be a one-two punch against eco-systems.<p>
The single best example of such destruction is the nation's largest 
wetlands, the Everglades. Phosphorous fertilizer run-off from sugar 
cane has set off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria 
and algae and alsofosters the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails.<p>   
Because of such problems, pesticides and fertilizers are heavily 
targeted by government regulators. And it's seems only right that the 
government be involved because, you see, it's the government that's 
responsible for much of the problem.<p>
That's the conclusion of a new study from the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C. <p>
The study analyzed data from six major farms states, and found that 
eliminating farm subsidies could reduce chemical use per acre by as 
much as 35%.<p>
This is because under the federal price support program, which applies 
to many types of crops, the government pays the farmer a guaranteed 
price for his yield. If, come harvest time, the crops don't bring in 
that minimum price the government pays the farmer the difference, 
called a deficiency payment.<p>
Naturally, this short-circuits the market. Farmers grow extra crops 
not because there are waiting mouths out there but because the 
government is paying a bounty. Extra crops require extra pesticides 
and fertilizer.<p>
But it gets worse. In order to try to limit these extra crops, the 
government encourages farmers--through additional payments--to keep 
part of their land idle. But farmers are terrific businessmen, and a 
heck of a lot smarter than your average bureaucrat. So the farmer goes 
to extraordinary lengths to get as many crops as he can out of the 
acreage still in use. This includes pouring on all the more fertilizer 
and pesticides.<p>
U.S. consumption of plant fertilizer is now close to an all-time high, 
while pesticide use per acre is at its highest point ever.<p>
Now we have too much fertilizer and pesticide in use and too much 
food. This surplus food practically guarantees that commodity prices 
will be low again next year and the cycle starts all over again. It's 
so ridiculous you'd think it was directed by Kevin Costner, except 
that this overblown budget is on a government scale. That puts farm 
subsidy prices at about $10 billion per year.<p>
Myself, I have better uses for my tax dollars than destroying precious 
wetlands. I also didn't give up the benefit of phosphorous detergent 
just to subsidize its use by farmers, who were always the greatest 
source of phosphorous pollution in any case.<p>
In the case of the Everglades, no deficiency payments are made. So the 
sugar lobby wants you to think it's not costing you anything. But 
instead of direct payments, the government has established a quota-
based tariff on sugar imports. In all, the sugar program is estimated 
to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year and, again, encourages excess 
crop growing.<p>
But if you, me, and the alligators and egrets don't care much for this 
whole business, you won't hear the bureaucrats complaining. Indeed, 
this is a jobs program for them.<p>
As study author Jonathon Tolman put it to me, "On one hand you have 
EPA doing everything it can to reduce pesticide use by any means 
possible, costing taxpayers a fortune.  And on the other hand you have 
the USDA using taxpayer money to get more of it." It's bizarre, which 
is to say business as usual for the feds.<p>
While CEI is often at odds with environmentalists, on this they have 
the full backing of the Wilderness Society.  "We think [the study] is 
indisputable," General Counsel Jim Webb told me. The nation is 
"investing a lot of national capital, in both dollars and critters, in 
keeping this subsidy going." <p>
Any one study needs to be seen as just that--one study. But other 
studies support  Tolman's findings.  One conducted on the North 
Carolina coastal plain, for example, found that elimination of farm 
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching from fertilizer use by 
46%. And data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys shows 
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program 
used nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those 
who didn't participate.<p>
There is relief from all this in the former of legislation introduced 
by Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Republican Rep. Dick 
Zimmer (N.J.) that would phase out most deficiency payments over the 
next six years (giving farmers a chance to adjust) and make other 
major cuts in federal farm subsidies. Other legislation before 
Congress would begin removing those sweet special privileges the sugar 
lobby receives.<p>
If alligators and egrets could lobby their congressmen--and why not, 
if dead people in Chicago can vote?--they'd surely be lobbying to get 
rid of farm supports.<p>

<h2>TIME TO MAKE AMERICORPS A CORPSE</h2><p>
By<br> <A href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Back in 1993 it was called "the best of Bill Clinton" and something 
"no one can quarrel with" except possibly to argue that "the whole 
thing isn't big enough." But a just-released Government Accounting 
Office report indicates that it is nonetheless big enough to be a fine 
example of Clintonesque waste in a time when far worthier programs are 
facing the budget-cutter's axe.<p>
"It" was the Clinton administration's proposed national service 
program, later dubbed "AmeriCorps," under which a person would 
received a stipend and a $4,725 college educational voucher for 
providing civilian national service.<p>
As part of an allegedly austere budget, Clinton wanted to spend $7.4 
billion on AmeriCorps over five years.  Congress gave its approval but 
scaled the program back to $1.5 billion for a three-year program.<p>
Now the Republican-dominated House has voted to cut off funding for 
the program as of October 1, with the Senate set to consider that 
proposal shortly.<p>
 Some criticism of AmeriCorps is unfair, such as making fun of their 
tag as "volunteers" because they are paid. Our "all-volunteer Army" is 
paid, as are members of the Peace Corps and other programs generally 
considered volunteer. Clearly the AmeriCorps members are volunteers in 
that they weren't forced into the program, as would have been if a 
number of both conservative and liberal pundits had had their way.<p>
Further, while the average stipend plus benefits value per hour, at a 
bit less than $7.50, is well above minimum wage,  no youth is going to 
get rich working for AmeriCorps.<p>
Yet, as is so often the case when the government is involved, much of 
the money allotted to the program somehow seems to be slipping through 
the cracks and crevices.<p>
The GAO report found that AmeriCorps cost $26,654 per participant. 
While AmeriCorps claims its overhead is only 5% of its budget, the GAO 
report shows that over half the average expense per member goes to 
something other than pay and benefits.<p>
In a July, 1994 letter to AmeriCorps critic Charles Grassley (Rep.-
Iowa),  Eli J. Segal, head of the Corporation for National Service, 
the parent organization of AmeriCorps, said that "the federal share 
[of the cost of supporting an AmeriCorps participant] should not 
exceed $13,000 on average."  In fact, the federal share was $20,806.  <p>
The more the federal involvement, the higher the cost.  For non-
federal agencies receiving AmeriCorps grants, the funding average was 
$25,797 while for federal ones it was $31,017.<p>
While 15% of AmeriCorp's budget was to come from private 
contributions, so far less than 7% does--though Eli  insists that with 
time that figure will improve.<p>
In a country in which 80 million people claim to be doing at least 
some part-time volunteer work (though of course there is always a need 
for more), are 20,000 more volunteers a year at $26,654 a head really 
worth it?  According to many pundits and editorialists, they are.<p>
To read some accounts of AmeriCorps, one wonders how the country could 
have survived over two centuries without it. There they are, combating 
inner-city drug abuse and crime, cleaning up beaches, fighting global 
climate change. So heralded are they in the media that when Tennessee  
AmeriCorps members decided to work on Martin Luther King day it made 
the pages of the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Such incredible dedication 
obviously deserves recognition.<p>
Some of the projects have been of dubious value. The San Francisco 
Chronicle profiled one participant who earned her pay and benefits by 
providing AIDS education to deaf homosexuals.  Apparently 14 years 
after the AIDS epidemic began, deaf San Francisco homosexuals remain 
ignorant of how the disease is spread.<p>
Other projects are more dubious yet. In Denver, AmeriCorps members 
earned their pay by handing out leaflets attacking a city councilman.<p>
But political activism is not so much the problem as plain old waste. 
A federal report on the Orange County, California AmeriCorps branch 
revealed that while the program was supposed to provide service 
programs for more than 1500 people in Orange County, none of the 
programs in the four participating cities ever had more than 25 
participants, with most ranging from five to 15.  Other Orange County 
AmeriCorps projects, such as knitting a memorial quilt for survivors 
of the Oklahoma City bombing, have a real air of make-work about them. 
By the way, the quilt was never finished.<p>
But the Orange County program is just one bad apple out of a big 
national barrel right? Actually, the federal evaluation report stated, 
"Overall, this is a good AmeriCorps program."  One shudders to think 
what a bad program is like. <p>
Clinton likens AmeriCorps to such projects as President Franklin 
Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and President Kennedy's 
Peace Corps. Indeed, in his State of the Union address last January, 
Clinton accidentally referred to AmeriCorps as "the Peace Corps."<p>
But both these programs had clearly defined goals.  The CCC planted 
trees, fought forest fires, dug drainage ditches. The Peace Corps 
brought medical care, sanitation, and new agricultural techniques to 
underdeveloped parts of the world.<p>
AmeriCorps's charge, on the other hand, is an amorphous "Go out there 
and do some good!"  Such a vague, feel-good, approach, some might say, 
is a nice metaphor for the Clinton administration in general.<p>

<title>NY Times Blows Hot Air Over Global Warming</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr><center><h2>NEW YORK TIMES BLOWS <br>HOT AIR OVER GLOBAL WARMING </h2>By Michael Fumento 
</center><hr><p> 

If you're like me, about twice a month you get a fat yellow envelope 
from this guy named  Ed McMahon, saying "YOU, JOHN DOE could already 
be the winner" of 9 million dollars or some such. If you're like me 
you toss the envelope away, realizing that here the difference between 
"could" and "are" is vast and virtually insurmountable.<p>

So, it is too, in the world of environmental doomsaying, which leads 
us to the subject of the New York Times front-page article by William 
K. Stevens: "Scientists Say Earth's Warming Could Set Off  Wide 
Disruptions." In that same edition a Times editorial decried possible 
congressional cuts in funding for global warming research.<p>

This article was intended as the knock-out blow, with the setup left 
jab having come a week earlier in the form of another Steven's front-
page article "Experts Confirm Human Role in Global Warming."  There 
Stevens began with a reference to a draft report by the U.N. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "In an important 
shift of scientific judgment," he wrote, "experts advising the world's 
governments on climate change are saying for the first time that human 
activity is a likely cause of the warming of the global atmosphere."<p>

Actually, scientists have long acknowledged that human activity, 
through release of "greenhouse" gases that trap heat, would cause some 
warming. As Robert Balling Jr., Director of the Office of Climatology 
at Arizona State University says, "The issue all along has been how 
much warming and whether it would be countered by other cooling 
mechanisms."<p>

Any environmentalist will gladly tell you the interaction of various 
forces on the globe can be terribly complicated. Probably the main 
complication here has been the effect that the heat build-up would 
have on water vapor, which in turn could cause a cooling effect.<p>

Such complications have spawned a huge number of models estimating 
just how much total heat increase the globe would experience, ranging 
from "utterly insignificant" to the doomsayers' "extra crispy."<p>

The real news of the IPCC draft report, according to report  reviewer 
and University of Virginia climatologist Dr. Patrick Michaels, is that 
the doomsayers' model is kaput.<p>

"What Stevens completely missed is that the mid-point of the model 
which they are now touting shows far less warming than the model upon 
which they based the 1992 Rio de Janeiro agreement," he told me.<p>

That treaty committed the nations of the earth in principle to spend 
tens of billions of dollars to reduce greenhouse emissions.<p>

Yet Michaels believes that this latest warming projection could still 
be far too high while another respected researcher, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology climatologist and IPCC report reviewer Richard 
Lindzen, believes that warming will probably always be at a level 
difficult or impossible to detect above normal yearly fluctuations.<p>

Lindzen says newer projections show less and less warming than 
previous ones because they are being tweaked into doing so. The 
reason?  Real-life measurements are showing only slight warming. 
According to NASA scientist Roy Spenser, 17 years of satellite data 
show a rate of warming of about 7/100 of a degree per decade, or a 
rise of about 7/10 of a degree by the year 2100.<p>

That's "considerably less warming than climate models predict," he 
told me.<p>

Which leads us to part two of Stevens' attack, the potential 
catastrophe which is as likely as Ed McMahon showing up at your door 
with a check.<p>

It's not only that warming is far less than what was predicted. Less 
warming means fewer effects and less dire ones. More than this it 
seems increasingly clear that this warming is not a generalized one. 
Most of the warming it appears will be at night, when the temperatures 
are coldest.  Most will also be during the winter and in the frigid 
far north at that.<p>

"The season to season extremes are decreasing," says Michaels.<p>

Global warming-induced melting of the polar ice caps was the basis for 
Kevin Costner's embarrassing movie "Waterworld," in which virtually 
the entire earth is submerged. Terrified island nations are the 
strongest supporters of costly international sanctions against 
greenhouse gas restrictions.<p>

But, notes Michaels, if anything significant global warming could be 
expected to add to the polar caps by increasing precipitation above 
the poles. "Waterworld" flops again.<p>

Speaking of island nations, how about those predictions of vast 
numbers of  "super" hurricanes?  The Environmental Defense Fund's 
Michael Oppenheimer, an important source for Stevens, has predicted 
one of these as early as 1997,  killing 22,000 Floridians.<p>

But according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 
Floridians can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency.<p>

It's true that the IPCC draft report on which Stevens based his dire 
story does mention the possibility of severe climate problems, but as 
Michael MacCraken, who is coordinating the U.S. governmental review of 
the IPCC report, explained to me, that's because it was just a first 
draft and the authors were obligated to mention any and all possible 
weather permutations, if only for later drafts to shoot them down.<p>

Tomorrow the earth COULD be invaded by flying saucers with tall aliens 
carrying cookbooks entitled To Serve Man. But idle speculations are 
best left for things like the O.J. Simpson trial, not matters of world 
import and the front page of  the New York Times. <p>

<title>Racial Politics Make Strange Enemies</title>

<center><h2>RACIAL POLITICS MAKE STRANGE ENEMIES </h2>
By Michael Fumento
</center>
<hr> <p>
 

Whoever said that lynch mobs are a thing of the past in this country 
hasn't seen the pack chasing Dinesh D'Souza with a rope.<p>

D'Souza is the John M. Olin fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute (AEI) and author of the just-published book The End of 
Racism, which is the source of all the controversy.<p>

The book challenges the idea that racism is the primary cause of black 
problems, and says that the civil rights community, while once a boon 
to blacks, has become more of an albatross. D'Souza's ultimate target 
is failed liberal policies, which is why it's interesting that most of 
the early and very angry criticism of the work has come from the 
right.<p>   

Upon publication of the book, two AEI black conservative adjunct 
fellows, Glenn Loury and Robert Woodson, angrily resigned their 
positions. Loury also wrote a damning review of the book for the new 
conservative Weekly Standard.<p>

The resignations then became subject of an even more damning column by 
William Raspberry.  While not really a conservative, Raspberry has 
nonetheless shared the views of Woodson, Loury, and yes, D'Souza, that 
the liberal approach to the problems of the black community leaves 
much to be desired and that tagging all opponents as racists is 
generally counterproductive.<p>

Yet Raspberry tagged D'Souza's work as one "only racists could cheer" 
while Woodson went even further, calling D'Souza "the Mark Furhman of 
public policy."<p>

Can he really mean that? Can this be said of a writer whose book black 
conservative Thomas Sowell has called the best book on the topic in 
half a century?<p>

Would Mark Furhman have written a book former NAACP Chairman Margaret 
Bush Wilson has called "rich and provocative" or that a former 
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said was "of  
stunning eloquence and power" with "a profound vision for transcending 
the pathology of race"?<p>

Part of the problem, no doubt, is that some people would rather attack 
a 742-page book than to bother actually reading it.<p>

Thus an article in USA Today says the book maintains "many people are 
racist for good reason." No, actually it says many people who might be 
accused of being racist are not; rather they act out of rational 
prejudice. Thus cab drivers--white, black, Hispanic, and Asian--are 
far more likely to shy away from young, black male fares because they 
know they are far more likely to be robbed and killed by them.<p>

Recall the Rev. Jesse Jackson's words about walking "down the street 
and hear[ing] footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look 
around and see somebody white and feel relieved." <p>

Either the USA Today reporter is lying or hasn't read D'Souza's book, 
but in any case his readers will believe that D'Souza has said there 
can be a good reason for racism. Some of them repeat the charge in 
what may become a snowballing effect.<p>

Likewise, Raspberry concludes his column saying "D'Souza strives 
mightily to convince us there aren't any" racists. In fact, D'Souza 
has a whole chapter called "Bigotry in Black and White" which says 
that while the old style of racism is on the decline a new type is on 
horizon and may be on rise.<p>

As both author and book make repeatedly clear, the point isn't that 
racism is dead. Rather, D'Souza says,  "In a contemporary sense racism 
is no longer the prime obstacle raised by African-Americans or any 
other group.<p>

"If white racism ended tomorrow," D'Souza told me, "this would do 
little to improve black test scores, increase black savings rates, 
boost black rates of business formations, reduce black crime or 
strengthen black families. Those are the most serious cultural 
challenges facing black Americans, especially poor blacks. Racism is 
not the most serious challenge."<p>    

Do these sound like the ravings of a hooded skin-headed neo-Nazi Aryan 
Nation scumsucker? <p>

So why all this anger?<p>

Says D'Souza, "I think the hidden key to this thing is that I'm not 
black and that I'm discussing these things in public."<p>

That theory is certainly supported by the title of the column about 
D'Souza's book in the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times: "An Outsider's 
Arrogance." Ooh, feel the indignation!<p>

If D'Souza has been wrong about one thing it was in thinking that 
being "a person of color" would protect him from charges of messing 
with other people's business. As a native of Bombay, India, he is 
indeed a cultural and ethnic hodge-podge. He's Asian yet Caucasian 
rather than mongoloid; he's lighter than Clarence Thomas though darker 
than Whitney Houston and one hell of a lot darker than Michael 
Jackson.<p>

But black he ain't.<p>

Yet D'Souza was right in thinking that the debate over black problems 
must be open to all races and ethnic groups. It's a good thing that 
early women's rights advocates didn't have such a sectarian view. 
After all, by definition 100% of the people who gave women the right 
to vote were men.<p>

America is 88% non-black. It was white government policies that helped 
create the terrible problems so many blacks face today. Thus non-
blacks will have to play a major role in ending those problems. 
Disagree with D'Souza if you wish, but read him first. And salute one 
man with the guts to squarely confront one of our nation's most vexing 
problems.<p>

<title>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS -- Fumento</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center><h2>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS</h2> <p> 
By Michael Fumento</center><p>
<hr>
 

Long before the current price-fixing scandal rocked the halls of 
Archer Daniels Midland, the self-styled "supermarket to the world," 
was a super rip-off for the public. And its co-conspirators in this 
scandal are the likes of President Bill Clinton and presidential 
wannabe Kansas Republican Senator Robert Dole.<p>

The tool used to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from 
the taxpayer to ADM is ethanol, alcohol distilled from corn. When 
mixed with gasoline, ethanol is called gasohol. About 55% of the 
ethanol produced in this country is manufactured by ADM, based in 
Decatur, Ill.  With sales of about $11 billion a year, ADM is the 
largest grain-processing company in the world.<p>

But gasohol has problems at the pump. First, it hurts mileage. Second, 
it's considerably more expensive than gasoline. Nobody is going to buy 
a fuel that both costs more and hurts mileage unless either A) the 
fuel is subsidized so that it doesn't cost more, or B) they are forced 
to. In this case, ADM has arranged through its friends in high places 
to make it C) both of the above.<p>

In addition to myriad state tax breaks, gasoline blended with ethanol 
is eligible for a federal tax credit of 5.4 cents a gallon, totalling 
an estimated $770 million a year. Over half that goes straight into 
ADM CEO Dwayne Andreas's coffers.<p>

Introducing that law was Dole, ADM's point man for its assault on the 
taxpayers. Dole has introduced over two dozen bills to help the 
ethanol industry and lobbied fiercely for it outside of Senate 
chambers as well.<p>

ADM needs people like Dole because ethanol is not only too expensive, 
it's worthless.<p>

Ethanol is touted as cleaner than gasoline. Indeed, it can reduce 
emissions of carbon monoxide, a fairly minor pollutant. While harmful 
in enclosed areas, it never causes serious health problems even at the 
very highest levels found in outdoor air.<p>

Moreover, ethanol only reduces carbon monoxide emissions from cars 
built before oxygen sensors were made mandatory in 1983 or whose 
oxygen sensors are broken. Repeated studies at the University of 
Denver using a remote testing device invented there have found that 
out of 250-300 late model vehicles tested, at most one will put out 
significant carbon monoxide emissions.<p>

Ethanol is also said to reduce ground-level ozone pollution, but a 
study by Sierra Research of Sacramento, California found that it would 
actually slightly INCREASE ozone production and increase smog. Indeed, 
in 1992 the EPA declared it could not be certified as a pollution-
fighting fuel for use in the nation's smoggiest cities. Immediately, 
as the Wall Street Journal put it, Dole "lobbied the administration 
from President Bush on down." Dole won, ADM won, and airbreathers lost 
as the EPA relented and certified ethanol.<p>

 Ethanol is also presented as a way to prop up corn prices by 
increasing corn demand. It does do that, but a by-product of its 
production is a corn mash sold as feed. That reduces the demand for 
soybeans, a crop corn farmers grow as part of crop rotation.<p>

In any case, it would be far cheaper to just funnel a subsidy directly 
corn farmers rather than funnel it through ADM.<p>

The real reason for ethanol's continued blessed existence isn't amber 
waves of grain but ample waves of cash. "Dwayne Andreas just owns me," 
former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss once told the 
Washington Post. It turns out Andreas actually owns lots of other 
important people, too.<p>

Since just 1991, Andreas and his family, ADM, and the ADM PAC have 
contributed over $1.18 million to the Republican Party and $1.05 
million to the Democrats.<p>

But nobody has benefited from this largesse more than Bob Dole. To 
date, ADM has contributed over $85,000 to Dole's various campaign 
bids, along with various other perks.<p>

The most lucrative contribution to Dole was ADM's co-sponsorship of 
"Face-Off," a daily three-minute radio debate between Dole and 
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy from 1984 to November 1987, 
when Dole declared his presidential candidacy. A spokesman for the 
show told me the value of this free advertising for Dole was about 
$840,000.<p>

Even while he denies being Andreas's chief  lackey, it is a position 
Dole jealously guards. In August, speaking of the ethanol industry, 
Dole told an audience at the Illinois State Fair, "So far, we've been 
shut out by this administration."<p>

Really?<p>

Last year, shortly after Dwayne Andreas served as co-chairman of a 
Democratic Party fundraiser and personally donated $100,000, the 
Clinton Administration, via the EPA, tried to mandate that about 10% 
of all gasoline sold nationally contain ethanol. But in May a federal 
appeals court declared the administration "exceeded its authority" in 
so doing.<p>

With that shot down, the ethanol lobby demanded a different gift, 
insisting that an ethanol-containing gasoline additive called ETBE 
receive the same tax break that pure ethanol gets. The Treasury 
Department quickly granted it. The ADM-supported American Corn 
Grower's Alliance then announced,  "Agriculture owes the President 
many thanks for seeing him continue to fulfill his pledge to be an 
advocate for ethanol, ETBE, and oxygenated fuels."<p>

(Note to the tobacco companies: If you want Clinton off your backs, 
just lace your cigarettes with a little ethanol.)<p>

The ADM executive who blew the whistle on its alleged price-fixing 
scheme says that the company's philosophy is: "The competitor is our 
friend; the consumer is our enemy." They could add to that another 
one: The politician is our lackey; the public is our sucker.<p>

<h2>Fatheads at FDA Opposing Best Interests of Fat Americans</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><b><i> Michael Fumento</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Unless you've been living in outer space or under a rock lately, 
you've noticed that our country has a serious problem with obesity. We 
are the fattest nation on earth. A recent British government report 
launched front-page headlines after it declared that if present trends 
continue 25% of British women and 18% of British men will be obese, 
meaning they are at least 20% fatter  than they should be. But in the 
United States already 35% women and 31% men are obese.  One 
contributing factor may be the faithful watchdogs of the Food and Drug 
Administration.<p>

Make no mistake, drugs are not the answer to the national problem.  
For some individuals, however, they have proven quite useful, 
especially one called dexfenfluramine. This is where our story begins.
<p>
Dexfenfluramine is no wonder drug.  Unlike the mercilessly hyped 
hormonal agent that you heard about in July, it doesn't promise that 
you can stuff your face till kingdom come and still maintain a figure 
that would put Kate Moss to shame.  On the other hand, dexfenfluramine 
works.<p>

At the September meeting, manufacturer Interneuron Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. said its drug helped 40 percent of patients in a study lose up to 
10 percent of their body weight, twice the amount lost with diet 
alone. Myriad other studies conducted over many years have shown the 
drug to be an effective weight-loss tool for those who really want and 
need it.<p>

Other studies, however, showed that when dexfenfluramine is given in 
ultra-high doses to animals, it can permanently alter their brain 
chemicals. But the level at which it causes this damage is 10 to 20 
times higher than that which humans receive.<p>

Nevertheless, in late September, an eight-member FDA panel voted 5-3 
against recommending approval of the drug for use in the United 
States. After some members left, those remaining voted 3-2 in favor of 
the drug but an FDA spokeswoman said the second vote could not be 
official and so a second meeting was ordered for November.<p>

In its caution, the FDA panel refused to weigh the slight possibility 
of harm of the drug versus the very real harm caused by obesity. It 
has been linked to heart disease, cancer, arthritis, gallbladder 
disease, gout, and a host of other nasties that includes even 
blindness.  The government estimates that 300,000 Americans will die 
prematurely from obesity this year, the second leading lifestyle-
related cause of death after cigarettes.<p>

Moreover, it's not like rats are our only guinea pigs, so to speak.  
More than a million people in more than 50 other countries are already 
using the drug. In some European countries they've had access to it 
for a decade.<p>

The refusal to approve this drug is just the latest example of the 
overweaning paternalism that characterized the FDA for many years but 
has now become quite onerous under current Commissioner David Kessler. 
It's not Kessler's fault that no new anti-obesity drug has been 
introduced in the last 22 years into this country that's splitting its 
collective seams, but it will be his fault if this amazing streak 
continues.<p>

But aren't there other drugs that can be used in the meantime? Yes, 
the second fiddle appears to be a combination of two drugs, 
phentermine and fenfluramine.  These, too, have been shown to be safe 
and effective. Like dexfenfluramine, however, they are treatments and 
not cures. The weight lost with them comes back at you like a steam 
train the day you stop taking them. But the FDA in its wisdom only 
allows doctors to prescribe them for three months.  In other words, as 
soon you get your weight down to a healthful level, as soon as you've 
glimpsed the towers of the Land of Oz, everything is taken from you.<p>

But how about those over-the-counter pills, phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride, mercifully shortened to "PPA." They appear to burn off 
about half a pound a week (though this amount can easily be 
overwhelmed by compensatory eating of even half a cheeseburger a day) 
but were shown much more effective when combined with caffeine.<p>

Indeed, caffeine itself has been shown repeatedly to speed up the 
metabolism and at high enough levels, especially when combined with 
ephedrine and small amounts of aspirin, to slowly induce weight loss--
again, unless the dieter ups his or her calorie intake even slightly.<p>

But amazingly, in 1991 the FDA placed caffeine on its list of 
ingredients banned from diet aids as being ineffective.<p>

What the heck is going on here? Is the FDA staffed at the highest 
levels by men who are into fat women?  Or women who are into fat men?  
Probably not.<p>

Instead, this is probably just another example of the FDA's obsessive 
paternalism and love of bureaucracy. I just happen to know about these 
abuses of authority and sanity because I happen to be writing a book 
on obesity. Were I writing a book on tennis elbow, I could probably 
rattle off for you how myriad examples of how the FDA impedes those 
seeking relief from that problem.<p>

Judith Stern of the American Obesity Association said that if the FDA 
panel recommends no on dexfenfluramine, "these doctors ought to be 
shot." That's a bit harsh.  How about we just force feed them until 
their shirt buttons pop off and they start developing that list of 
nasties that comes with obesity. A little bit of empathy never hurt 
anyone.<p>

<h2>Crime Study Doesn't Show Racism</h2>

One in three young black men is serving a criminal sentence, according 
to a new report that has received wide media coverage. Depending on 
your perspective, the timing couldn't have been more ironic or more 
fitting, coming as it did on the heels of the "not guilty" verdict in 
the O.J. Simpson case.
                                   <P>
Could this be what Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran was talking about 
when he urged the jury to "send a message"?  Was the message that 
blacks are tired of blacks behind bars?
                <P>
There are certainly a lot there, though perhaps not as many as you 
might think from the news stories. In the report, the Sentencing 
Project, an advocacy group that favors alternatives to prison, 
estimates that on any given day 32 percent of black men ages 20 to 29 
are serving a criminal sentence. 
                                                                             <P>
That's 827,400 young black men. But what most of the news stories 
didn't tell you was that the majority were not behind bars but on 
probation or parole. If you don't think that's an important 
distinction, then you've never been in jail or prison and have never 
talked to anybody who has.
                                                                 <P>
The Sentencing Project study quite deliberately blurs this 
distinction, as when it says that "about 3/4 of all offenders under 
supervision have been convicted of a non-violent offense." True, but a 
1991 Department of Justice survey of state prison inmates found that 
of those actually incarcerated, half had committed violent crimes and 
fully 94% had either committed a violent crime or had received a 
previous criminal sentence.  
                                                  <P>
It's a good thing that the Sentencing Project didn't actually focus 
just on prison sentences, because the reality is that they have become 
a joke. Consider the four original suspects in the killing of British 
tourist Gary Colley at a Florida rest stop two years ago. One already 
had at least 56 prior arrests by the age of 13; another had more than 
30 arrests and a third had at least two dozen. The 13-year-old was 
released for lack of evidence and most recently was arrested for 
kidnaping and robbing a pizza deliverer at gunpoint.
                                         <P>
But the media reporting on the Sentencing Project study didn't go into 
any of this. Nor did the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he cited it at his 
"Million Man March" speech. Instead they concentrated on the disparity 
between black and white sentencing, noting that only 6.7% of 20-29-
year-old whites were ending up on the wrong side of the law.
                                <P>
To its credit, the study did not simply scream about racism, although 
the media attempted to portray it that way. It doesn't accuse all 
cops, or judges for that matter, of being Mark Fuhrmans. Rather, it 
says, the great majority of the increase in sentencing for blacks in 
recent years has come about because of a disproportionate emphasis on 
jailing those involved with crack cocaine usage.
                      <P>
Crack cocaine, it notes, is far more of a black problem than is powder 
cocaine, therefore discriminating against crack users and dealers 
means discriminating against blacks.
              <P>
But there is good reason to discriminate between types of cocaine. 
Several studies have concluded, as did that of Rutgers University 
researchers Kolin Chin and Jeffrey Fagan, that "arrest and conviction 
data suggest that violence and participation in drug selling are more 
strongly associated with crack than with cocaine [powder].
                                                      <P>
"The evidence is quite clear," American Enterprise Association 
Resident Scholar Doug Besharov told me. "Crack is a more addictive, 
violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine. Period."
                                             <P>
Further, the charge of drug possession is often used when the offender 
has committed other crimes that are much more serious but harder to 
prove. It is also often used in plea-bargaining cases, wherein the 
accused agrees to plead guilty to the least serious offense with which 
he has been charged.
                                  <P>
Besharov says, "There's no doubt that crack has assaulted the black 
community." Indeed, so have black criminals. Ninety percent of their 
victims are black themselves. White liberal do-gooders such as make up 
most of the staff at the Sentencing Project have little to fear if we 
slacken our efforts at criminal enforcement.
                         <P>
There's no doubt there's something pathologically wrong in a society 
in which a third of the members of the second-largest race are 
involved in the criminal justice system.  Throwing young men in prison 
or putting them on probation or parole doesn't solve this problem. The 
ultimate solution lies in getting rid of government programs that 
break down the family, like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 
in improving the quality of public schools, in fostering a culture of 
personal responsibility and in no longer blaming racism for every 
black problem.
    <P>
So long as business as usual goes on in the black inner-cities, they 
will produce vast numbers of criminals and many of these will wind up 
in the penal system. And business as usual, it is.  After the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, one Nation of Islam leader called on Simpson to 
become an active symbol for the nation's troubled black youth. Jesse 
Jackson gushed, "O.J. can now be a big force, in my judgment, in 
taking the lead against domestic violence."
                                                         <P>
Egad! And John Wayne Gacy should have opened a home for wayward boys 
while Jeffrey Dahmer should have become president of the National 
Restaurant Association.
                                              <P>
No, putting away young black men doesn't cure the problem. But until 
we're willing to apply the cure, it can keep the problem from becoming 
that much worse.
                                    <P>

<title>Fumento:  Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </title>

<h2>Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

 
 

"A burgeoning population and the growing demand for seafood may make 
fish unavailable to nearly a billion of the world's poor in the next 
century, says a new report." If you read USA Today or any number of 
other papers that carried a similar story, you probably believe that. 
Which is too bad because the report, issued by the pro-population 
control Population Action International is just one big, well, fish 
story.
 <P>
There's one huge problem with the report.  See if you can pick it out 
by reading between the lines of report co-author Robert Engelman. 
"We're up against the wall," he said. "Since the end of the  80s, 
we've been catching the same amount of wild fish around the world, 
[but] there are about 90 million more people every year."
               <P>
Did you notice the qualifying word: "wild"?  Yes, the statement is 
true for wild fish but completely ignores the role of farmed fish, 
called "aquaculture."  Looking at data provided in a 1995 United 
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization publication, "The State of 
World Fisheries and Aquaculture," we see that for the earliest year 
provided (1984) there were 51,105 thousand tons of wild fish caught 
with 6,933 thousand tons raised on farms.  Wild fish capture peaked 
out in 1989 and has dropped slightly to 56,470 thousand tons by 1993, 
but aquaculture continued growing like gangbusters to 15,800 tons by 
1993.
     <P>
Cmbining both types of fish, there was far from a decline but rather a 
24% increase in the nine-year period, fueled by a 128% growth in 
aquaculture. At the same time world population increased by only 16%. 
Unless you just happen to hate fish, that's a mighty nice "wall" we're 
up against. Far from running out of the slimy things, we're 
practically swimming in them.
                    <P>
Unfortunately, neither USA Today nor some of the other papers that 
carried the story bothered to mention aquaculture. In fact, nobody who 
carried the story allowed any criticism of the report at all.
                              <P>
The Population Action International study does mention the growing 
aquaculture industry, saying it "compensates somewhat for declines in 
fish catches." It even depicts a chart showing its phenomenal growth. 
But it downplays the industry, saying "Cultivation of fish has so far 
proven too costly to provide large amounts of food to poor people."
   <P>
But the aforementioned U.N. publication, using the same data as 
Population Action International, says otherwise. "The balance of 31 
million tons in the supplies of food fish required by the year 2010 
would have to come from aquaculture, which has been expanding at a 
rate of one million tons a year, increasing to almost two million tons 
in 1993." Meanwhile, to continue feeding the world at the same rate 
would require "an overall average annual increase of less than one 
million tons a year."
            <P>
While Population Action says, "There is little prospect for major 
expansion of aquaculture in Africa, the U.N. report says aquaculture's 
phenomenal "growth should continue, recognizing the SIGNIFICANT 
POTENTIAL OF INCREASED FARMED FISH PRODUCTION IN AFRICA and Latin 
America." (Emphasis mine.)
                         <P>
Yet, the real powerhouse could be the United States. So far all of 
North America produces only 3.7% of the world's aquaculture.  The 
United States produces less than a 16th of China's output. The reason 
is that Americans are not big fish eaters and that, exactly opposite 
of what Population Action is telling us, those who are big fish eaters 
are finding or growing a plentiful supply. But if that ever changes, 
America's ingenious farming know-how combined with abundant lakes and 
waterways will combine to make us not just the breadbasket but also 
the fishbasket of the world.
                                    <P>
What we're seeing is a rapid transition from depending on wild fish to 
raising our own which parallels civilization's movement from hunting 
and gathering to husbanding animals and raising crops. The very reason 
that fish farming is catching on so rapidly is that it is so much 
cheaper and more efficient than setting out in boats and hoping for 
good fortune. Less romantic perhaps, but them's the breaks.
                                               <P>
The problem with all the population control groups and individual 
gurus like Paul Ehrlich is that they first decided they were against 
population growth and have spent the entire time since then trying to 
find evidence to justify their position, rather than forming their 
position based on the evidence. The result has been a stream of 
nonsense that essentially began with Ehrlich's 1968 book The 
Population Bomb which told us that "the battle to feed humanity is 
over."
                                                        <P>
In fact, except for the occasional politically-inspired famine such as 
Ethiopia's, humanity is much better fed today than it was in 1968. 
Man's ingenuity in providing new food supplies has readily outpaced 
his growth in population growth.  Now, even as population growth is 
already slowing on its own, we're beginning a new era of genetically-
designed foods that will make even progress to date look anemic.
                                                                    <P>
 My advice to the population controllers:  If you don't like having 
more people around in  the same sense a lot of American just don't 
like eating fish, then simply say so. Quit concocting false evidence 
to scare everyone who doesn't share your taste.
                                                                             <P>
As for the rest of us, just ask any mermaid you happen to see, "What's 
a big fib?" "The Population Action study."

<h2>(W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

It's clearly a case of Grace under fire.  No, not the popular 
television show, but the Florida-based company W.R. Grace, the world's largest maker of speciality chemicals. Doing the firing is an activist group called the Foundation for Economic Trends (FET), headed up by the vociferous Jeremy Rifkin. Rifkin is leading a coalition of some of 200 groups and brandishing a petition signed by 100,000 Indian citizens.
<p>
Why the fuss?  To understand, you have to know a little about 
something called a neem tree.
<p>
The neem tree grows in a number of countries with tropical climates, 
but is especially plentiful and revered in India. Scientists call it 
one of the most helpful plants on earth, while Indians consider it 
sacred, calling it "the curer of all ailments." Its bark, leaves, 
flowers, and seeds are used to treat a variety of illnesses including 
leprosy, diabetes, ulcers, and skin disorders. The twigs are used as 
an antiseptic toothbrush while the seed oil is used to make toothpaste 
and soap. Oil from the seeds is a potent spermicide. The powdered 
leaves are used for facial cream.
<p>
In short, the neem appears to do everything but take your pulse and 
check your blood pressure. 
<p>
But what most appeals to the folks at W.R. Grace is that oil from the 
seeds is a powerful insecticide, repelling more than 200 species of 
bugs. The oil has long been used as such by Indians, but in its 
natural state the pesticide properties begin to decay within a matter 
of weeks or even days. Grace has developed a way of making this 
natural pesticide available to everyone by stabilizing it, thereby 
extending its shelf life for two years or more. The company has 
received a patent for the process.
<p>
"Foul!" cries Rifkin, who calls the patent "genetic colonialism" and 
is trying to get it revoked. "What we have here in broad terms," he 
told me, "is the beginning of worldwide discussion on who should 
control the gene pool."
<p>
I tried very hard to extract a valid point from Mr. Rifkin but failed.<p>  
First, he admitted that Grace's actions in securing a patent using 
Third World resources is hardly new or exceptional, but is just 
another case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic 
resources."
<p>
It's a bizarre accusation. Nobody should "control the gene pool," 
obviously, and Grace isn't trying. It didn't apply for a patent on the 
neem tree or its seeds or the oil from the seeds. The patent was for a 
process. To deny its patent because it involves a living thing is like 
saying someone can't get a patent for building a better mousetrap 
because the base of the mousetrap is made from wood.
<p>
Under U.S. law, a process or substance or invention may receive a 
patent--which is a temporary right of exclusive use and production--if 
it is novel, useful, and not obvious. You cannot therefore patent a 
gene, either here or abroad, since genes have always been around. <p>What 
you can do is patent a process you have developed using those genes or 
their product--in this case the oil from seeds.
<p>
All Grace's patent restricts is the ability to use the same 
stabilization method they have used. It doesn't even apply to 
extraction or processing of the neem extract prior to stabilization.  
<p>Nor does it even apply in India, since U.S. patent law doesn't extend 
there.
<p>
Rifkin says Grace's process isn't really even novel and that the 
patent should have been denied on that basis alone. Fine, let the 
Patent Office decide that.
<p>
Thus the "genetic" part of Rifkin's charge is obviously just a straw 
man.
<p>
What apparently rankles him is that some fat-cat Western company--no 
doubt headed up by porcine cigar-chompers--is once again exploiting 
Third World wealth. Rifkin complained to me that this was just another 
case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic resources."
<p>
The neem tree happens to be a convenient vehicle for his anti-
corporate crusade.
<p>
"Rifkin has cleverly picked an emotional issue because it's a 
religious tree in a Third World country," Says Henry Miller, a senior 
research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, California and 
a former FDA official.
<p>
But again, the colonialism charge just doesn't stick with Grace.
<p>
Some 22 companies have obtained patents regarding the neem tree, of 
which three are Indian. Grace buys its neem seeds on the open market 
and purchases less than three percent of the crop, which is 
unfortunate since 84% of the neem crop falls to the ground unharvested 
and simply rots.  Grace's Indian operation is run through an Indian 
holding firm, of which Grace is just a minority owner.
<p>
If this is the best one can do these days in ferreting out Ugly 
Americans, we Americans must be pretty handsome these days.
<p>
Rifkin and the FET are right that just because something CAN be done 
doesn't mean it SHOULD be done.  We need industry watchdogs like FET. 
<p>But there are no real ethical issues involved here, much less any of 
the Brave New World variety that FET likes to talk about. 
<p>
There's just a tree, with some really terrific products to offer, and 
one American company that isn't about to let its nationality get in 
the way of offering them.

<P> 
FOX RIVER GROVE, ILLINOIS--
 
It's called "Seven Angels Crossing" now.  As I write this, it's still 
blocked off.  Wreaths of flowers lie next to a light pole at the 
track. Marquees in the area express the sentiments of local 
businesses: "Our thoughts are with you," "Our prayers go out to you," 
"Pray for the families," "Seven angels, now in heaven." And everywhere 
there are the blue and white ribbons that used to simply be the colors 
of Cary-Grove High School but now mean so much more.
<p>
In late October, a commuter train slammed into a bus here, killing 
five children more or less immediately.  Two more died in the 
hospital.  To say that everyone in the towns of Cary and Fox River 
Grove was touched by the killings sounds cliche, yet it is true. I 
have friends here.  Their own children are too young to be in high 
school, but the boy across the street from them was killed and the 
brother of a girl who plays with their children was injured.
<p>
And everyone is asking the same question: "Why?"
<p>
Current attention is focusing on the signal lights at the crossing, 
and the crossing itself. It turns out that in the two-year period 
before the accident, some 45 complaints were filed with Illinois and 
railroad transportation officials over the crossing and the lights, 
though whether that proves an exceptional number has yet to be seen.
<p>
If it turns out it was an unusually hazardous crossing yet nothing was 
done about it, this will prove to a great extent to be business as 
usual. If there's one thing I've learned about Americans' attitudes 
towards risk in the years I've written about the subject, it is that 
they don't really understand it.  The relationship between that which 
we should fear and that which we do fear is often tenuous at best.  
This goes likewise for expenditures to reduce risks.
<p>
Thus, for example, under a 1991 EPA drinking water regulation, we 
spend $653 million per premature death averted.  A 1988 hazardous 
waste land disposal ban of the EPA costs $4.19 BILLION. An asbestos 
occupational exposure limit laid down in 1986 cost business $71 
million per life while one for arsenic cost $74 million.
<p>
These are not the highest figures I could find, nor the lowest. 
Suffice to say that saving lives through environmental regulation is 
routinely measured in the millions per person.
<p>
By comparison, expenditures that would prevent accidental deaths come 
relatively cheap.  Since we don't know yet what went wrong here in Fox 
River Grove, we can't put a price on fixing it.  But a Harvard Center 
for Risk Analysis publication puts the price of installing flashing 
lights at railway crossings that don't yet have them at a mere 
$733,523 per life saved. Add gates to that and you're still looking at 
only $787,267.  
<p>
"It is an enigma," Book of Risks author Larry Laudan told me, that a 
society that allows so many risky activities in terms of accidents 
will, "at the same time, demand the expenditures of tens of billions 
of dollars [over $115 billion, actually] annually on pollution control 
measures."  Drunk drivers alone, Laudan said, "do far more harm in 
producing injuries and death than ALL known sources of pollution. The 
ultimate irony is that it is not even clear that pollution abatement 
efforts always do much good."
<p>
The explanation, perhaps, says Laudan, "is the remarkable success of 
the environmental movement in persuading us that pollution is one of 
the principal killers of Americans."
<p>
He also cites "the unthinking fear that invisible dangers induce.  
Like radiation, pollution generally cannot be seen or felt.  By 
contrast, most causes of accidents are tangible and palpable--even 
familiar.  Psychologists repeatedly have shown that this sort of 
familiarity breeds indifference, if not contempt."
<p>
Often we find out too late that society's familiarity and contempt 
becomes the undoing of us or our loved ones.  I found out three years 
ago when my car went careening off a cliff just south of Big Sur on 
California's notorious Pacific Coast Highway.  The car rolled several 
times before coming to a halt 350 feet down, just short of the rocks 
at the edge of the water. Despite wearing a seat belt, my girlfriend 
broke her skull and neck and I was told she would probably die.  I 
didn't feel so good myself.
<p>
The good news is that we both survived and are doing fine, thank you.  
The bad news is that when I went back to the accident site I found it 
marked by a cross for a young man whose car had also gone over but who 
hadn't been so lucky.
<p>
When I inquired at the state Department of Transportation to find out 
how much a guardrail at this literal dead man's curve would have cost, 
I was told $1,000. But in this, the most environmentally conscious and 
most environmental regulation-happy state in the country, there was no 
$1,000 to spare for a guard rail.
<p>
Of course, environmental regulatory costs are buried--passed on to 
private businesses--while guard rails require explicit tax 
expenditures. But eventually, we pay for both
<p>
A rich country can afford adequate rail crossings, guard rails, and 
good environmental laws.  But no country can afford indiscriminate 
spending inspired by political activists instead of by careful cost-
benefit analyses. Let's stop finding out the hard way what our 
priorities should be. I know seven sets of parents whom I think would 
want it that way.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><i>11/20/95</i><hr><h2>Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a></center><hr>
<P>
What would you say if your city's housing code dwelled at great length 
on the sturdiness and structure of thatched roofs? What if vehicle 
regulations required blinders on your automobile so that it doesn't 
shy when an emergency vehicle passes by?
<p>
If you like those ideas, you'd love the federal Delaney Clause.
<p>
The Delaney Clause prohibits any measurable residue (from, say, 
pesticides) that has been found to cause cancer in either animals or 
man, in any processed food. Back in 1958, when it was passed as part 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it seemed to make sense. 
But just as "Married with Children" humor has replaced that of "Leave 
it to Beaver" (sigh), science has long since passed by Delaney.
<p>
That's in part because back when Delaney was passed, residues could 
only be measured in parts per thousand. Now they can be measured in 
parts per trillion and sometimes even in parts per quintillion. Let's 
say you detect a part per quadrillion in a plum product. That's the 
equivalent of one plum in 73,511,000 tons.
<p>
Delaney is also outdated because it greatly preceded the use of 
maximum tolerated dose testing in laboratory animals which didn't get 
going in earnest until the late 1960s. Under such testing, about half 
of all chemicals--both natural and synthetic--have caused tumors, 
which makes them verboten under Delaney.
<p>
Critics say this makes such testing useless, because it can't possibly 
be that half of everything is carcinogenic.
<p>
The fact that the natural world is full of rodent carcinogens makes 
Delaney "absurd," says pre-eminent Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames.
<p>
"There are a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee. Twenty-six have 
been tested and 19 have already proven positive, leaving about a 
thousand left to test," Ames told me. "The FDA would be laughed at if 
it tried to keep coffee from being added to ice cream. But there's no 
reason to think it's really a hazard."
<p>
In any case, decades after Delaney was passed, this rodent testing 
became its backbone.
<p>
Congress in 1958 could no more have predicted these new developments 
than the Continental Congress could have predicted the advent of 
warplanes, yet nobody claims we need to be restricted by language in 
the Constitution which only allows funding for an Army and a Navy. 
<p>
In addition to allowing natural rodent carcinogens while banning 
synthetic ones, Delaney encompasses another double standard.
<p>
First, more recent legislation does allow rodent carcinogens in 
unprocessed food, so long as the level is low enough under a certain 
formula to qualify as a "negligible risk." A fresh fruit could have a 
10 parts per billion of a pesticide and be allowed but if it's turned 
into a sauce or juice it might have only 1 part per billion and be 
banned.
<p>
But, some might argue, if Delaney has worked to date, why fix it if it 
ain't broke? In fact, it's always been broken but ignored. Because of 
the outrageousness of actually applying it, the EPA has simply chosen 
not to. But that's about to change because of a lawsuit the Natural 
Resources Defense Council won against the Agency, forcing strict 
compliance with the legislation.
<p>
Now, like it or not, the EPA has no choice but to ban 85 uses of 38 
different pesticide active ingredients. According to the Washington, 
D.C.-based non-profit research group National Center for Food and 
Agricultural Policy (NCFAP), this could result in increased production 
costs of $175 million over the next year and $212 million per year 
after that. The crops most affected would be potatoes, apples, and 
sugarcane, which account for 55% of the total potential costs. Look 
for your grocery bill to go up accordingly.
<p>
Said NCFAP Senior Research Associate Leonard P. Gianessi, ". . . the 
risks of the Delaney-listed pesticide uses are negligible, while the 
economic benefits that they provide are estimated to be $400 million 
per year."
<p>
The Delaney Clause was always too simplistic for its own good. 
Explains environmentalist and University of California biologist 
Garret Hardin, "The Delaney Act was passed because congressmen are old 
men. They are afraid of cancer. Because they're scared, they wanted 
zero tolerance. They did not get any scientific advice.  
Environmentalists who are scientists would never support a zero 
tolerance level for anything."
<p>
That's why even such ardent cheerleaders for pesticide regulation as 
regulation as New York Mt. Sinai pediatrician Dr. Phillip Landrigan 
and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) have called for its 
replacement by something more workable.
<p>
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) has introduced a bill which would 
implement recommendations by the National Research Council, including 
a "negligible risk" standard for both processed and raw foods. This 
determination would be made by the EPA Administrator, assisted by a 
newly-created science review panel.
<p>
Current EPA Administrator Carol Browner has already agreed in 
principle to such a scheme.
<p>
Make no mistake. Nostalgia is a great thing within limits, and here's 
to bringing back "Leave it to Beaver"-type shows in prime time while 
pulling the handle on the toilet in which "Married with Children" 
swims. But when the health and safety of people are concerned, our 
regulations need to reflect present the latest scientific evidence, 
not the state of the art from 1958.

<P>
 "In California, everything is so-o-o-o touchy feeling," [sic] said 
actress and comedienne Tracey Ullman, in explaining why she was moving 
herself and her daughter back to the United Kingdom. "They are into 
this silly outcome-based education where it doesn't matter if she  
knew HOW to spell her name as long as she knew WHO she was.  And it 
didn't matter if she KNEW that two plus two was four as long as she 
had enough self-confidence to ASK how to get  to the conclusion of the 
problem.' What a crock! She was going to end up as a dumb as a 
mudflap. Had to get her out."
<p>
Europeans have long made fun of two major American products, its beer 
and its education. But we're making great progress--with our beer. 
Education, however, continues to decay, with our students routinely 
rating themselves among the highest in the world while scoring  among 
the poorest.
<p>
The latest indication came with National Assessment of  Educational 
Progress scores recently released showing that "don't know much about 
history" has gone from being the line of a song to being the American 
national anthem.  Only 11% of seniors, 14% of eighth graders and 17% 
of fourth graders are considered "proficient" in U.S. history.  
They're comparative geniuses when it comes to geography though, with 
31% of the seniors proficient.
<p>
Some defenders of the students' performance claim the questions were 
really tough. Sure, like the one that asked whether New York, 
California, Illinois, or Texas was one of the 13 original colonies.  
Thirty-two percent of fourth-graders got that right.
<p>
Of course, 200  years is a long time ago.  So another question asked 
which conflict--World War I, World War II, the Mexican-American War, 
or Vietnam--was fought to contain communism.  Even fewer fourth-
graders got that cranium-cracker.
<p>
Sadly, test scores have been in decline for decades now, and to place 
the blame entirely on anything new is somewhat unfair.  But they were 
SUPPOSED to be getting better.  Blame it on  "outcome-based 
education."
<p>
Sounds harmless, doesn't it? In fact, Ullman's summary was amazingly 
void of hyperbole. "Outcome-based education" is a stealth term.
<p>
"It was a hijacking of the idea that schools should have been made 
more accountable but it made them less," author Charles Sykes told me 
in an interview. "Some conservative reformers in the 1980s began 
saying schools should be judged on the basis of outcome instead of 
inputs. Lots of governors and legislators bought into it only later to 
find out it was holistic healing and environmental stewardship."
<p>
Sykes's newest book is a hard critique of outcome-based education 
called Dumbing Down Uur Kids: Why America's Children Feel Good About 
Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add.  
<p>
The book is replete with chilling "scenes from the front." Thus, 
hearing about the poor history scores is hardly shocking after reading 
that in the upscale Denver suburb of Littleton a principal freely 
admitted that it was not important for students to learn any specific 
historical fact, including the ability to define either the Holocaust 
or World War II. 
<p>
Naturally such "educators" aren't too keen on tests and grading. Many 
outcome based school districts have abolished traditional grading 
entirely, replacing it instead with such as "C" for "consistently," 
"S" for "sometimes" and "N" for "not yet."
<p>
Nationally we have seen the best indicator of the increasing dumbness 
of our children simply erased.  Last year the administrators of the 
SAT pushed up the scoring standard so that scores just above 400 would 
now be pushed up to 500. In one fell swoop, the ability to compare 
today's student scores with those of their predecessors was destroyed.
<p>
It's also now possible to get a perfect SAT score without getting all 
the answers correct.
<p>
"Recognizing they were under more scrutiny to raise academic 
standards," Sykes told me, OBE administrators "have simply decided to 
make the standards unmeasurable.  A lot of schools are abolishing them 
and others are making everyone a winner."
<p>
Thus many Colorado schools have multiple valedictorians, with Boulder 
High School producing an amazing 26. And to think poor, inner-city 
schools can only afford one.
<p>
OBE also incorporates the self-esteem movement that has been around 
for decades. In theory, since high self-esteem and doing well are 
linked, by increasing self-esteem we can increase performance.  But 
Sykes points out that they're probably putting the proverbial cart 
before the, that it's success that drives self-esteem and not the 
other way around.
<p>
The self-esteem obsession is not only a waste but probably 
detrimental, he says. "If having kids feel good is top priority, you 
will be afraid to ask too much of them. In the long run this is a 
fraud because kids eventually hit reality like a brick wall, in 
college or the work world."
<p>
But Sykes believes there will be an education revolution.
<p>
"Public opinion is pretty clear," he says. "And OBE is taking schools 
in exactly the opposite direction. Add to this that the stakes are 
higher than ever since kids need to be better educated than they used 
to be.  Old factory jobs no longer exist.  The education 
establishment's response to all this is denial, vilification of 
critics, and circling of the wagons. To me that's a description of an 
institution that's ready to collapse.
<p>
Let's just hope it happens before all our kids are dumber than 
mudflaps.

<i>12/7/95</i><hr><h2>Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>

With a man who had torched three buildings  running around Boulder, 
Colorado city police were following smoke trails.  They caught their 
man, and he now faces a fine of $1,000 or 90 days in jail.  No, the 
perpetrator wasn't the arsonist (who was caught that same day); he was 
the owner of a bar  and a violator of Boulder's new anti-smoking law, 
one of the most draconian in the country.
<P>
The Boulder law goes way beyond mandating separate areas for smokers.  
Essentially it demands that smokers be kept away from non-smokers in 
hermetically-sealed rooms, as if they were the germ featured in the 
1971 movie The Andromeda Strain.  But a new report by the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) finds that the basis for it, as 
well as all the other anti-smoking laws which have swept the country 
since December of 1992, is scientifically bankrupt.
<P>
This refutes a much-publicized 1992 study, conducted by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which claimed as many as 3,000 
Americans die each year of lung cancer from somebody else's cigarette 
smoke. The EPA based its findings on a combined study (called a meta-
analysis) of 11 separate studies, which between them found 119 lung 
cancers among non-smoking spouses of smokers where 100 would be 
expected. Epidemiologists call this a "risk ratio" of 1.19. 
<P>
At the time, many people including myself criticized the EPA report, 
saying that such a small apparently increased risk (so tiny, in fact, 
that the medical community has rejected much larger ratios as being 
conclusive on other potential carcinogens) that the tiniest problem 
could throw the whole thing off.
<P>
We also questioned the EPA's use of a 90% confidence interval, meaning 
that there was a 10% possibility the results had been arrived at by 
chance.  The gold standard in epidemiology has always been a 95% 
confidence interval, leaving only a 5% possibility of a result 
occurring by chance.  Curiously, the Agency rejected that, in what 
appeared to be a rigging of the results. It was like moving the goal 
post to the three yard line because the football had fallen two yards 
short of a touchdown.
<P>
The new CRS report, which you're hearing about probably for the first 
time here because with the sole exception of the Washington Times (and 
an editorial in Investor's Business Daily) the media decided you 
didn't need to know about it, says we were right and the EPA was 
wrong.
<P>
 That report was produced in response to a proposed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration ruling that would ban smoking in 
federal workplaces.  It found no basis for such a ban.
<P>
Instead, it said the EPA's meta-analysis showed that, "Even when 
overall risk is considered, it is a very small risk and is not 
statistically significant at the 95% level."
<P>
The CRS also analyzed four other recent passive smoking studies.  Of 
them, only one--by Dr. Elizabeth Fontham--showed a significant 
increased risk.  Two others showed no higher risk and a third showed 
only a slight, statistically insignificant risk.
<P>
As is, that's something of a wash.  But even the Fontham study may not 
actually show an increased risk, said the CRS.  This is because of 
something called "smoker misclassification."  Surveys show that some 
people who claim to be nonsmokers are actually current or former 
smokers.  The EPA has recognized this phenomenon and has built in a 
small safety margin to account for it in the Fontham study.  But 
evidence indicates this safety factor was probably too small, and CRS 
says "a small adjustment could render the overall Fontham  results 
statistically insignificant at the 95% level."
<P>
So the only truly significant positive study would have been rendered 
insignificant.
<P>
Moreover, the CRS noted that the other three studies didn't allow for 
unidentified smokers. Had they done so, the lack of evidence for 
smoking's hazards to innocent bystanders would have been even more 
obvious.   
<P>
The ultimate purpose of the campaign that culminated in the EPA report 
was never to protect non-smokers but to harass and intimidate smokers 
themselves into quitting.  Now it could be said that smokers were in 
effect not just hurting themselves but murdering non-smokers.  So what 
if it's not true?  The end--getting active smokers to quit--justifies 
the means.  Right?
<P>
Such paternalism is obnoxious.  Anybody with two brain cells to rub 
together knows that smoking is harmful and can be fatal. More than a 
hundred years before the famous 1964 surgeon general's report, 
cigarettes were known as "coffin nails." Smokers may be irrational, 
but irrationality within limits is protected in our society.
<P>
Meanwhile, where does such paternalism end?  One of the arresting 
officers in Boulder, a female, was quite corpulent.  (Trendy towns 
like Boulder are willing to overlook beefy cops if it means beefing up 
the number of female officers on the force.) Obesity is considered to 
cause 300,000 premature deaths a year, 100 times the EPA estimate for 
lung cancers caused by passive smoking.  Perhaps that officer should 
arrest the next waiter who puts a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo before 
her.  "Boy, you in a heap  o trouble for heapin' that pasta so high!"
<P>
Perhaps I shouldn't give them any ideas.

<i>12/13/95</i><hr><h2>The Long Suppressed Truth About AIDS</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
You've heard it over and over in the media: AIDS is "an equal 
opportunity destroyer" that threatens all Americans "without 
discriminating."  Now a new study in Science magazine shows an 
epidemic both smaller than the government has claimed--and one that 
clearly does discriminate.
<P>
The media treated it as quite a revelation.  In fact, as we shall see, 
this same vital information was available seven years ago and was 
deliberately suppressed.
<P>
The Science study, by NCI statistician Phil Rosenberg, shows a 
tremendous disparity between infected groups. For example, while as of 
January 1993, only one in 2,000 American white females between the 
ages of 18 and 59 was living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, one 
in 204 white males was.  For black females the rate is one in 135, 
while black males have the highest infection rate of all at one in 44. 
Hispanics fall somewhere between, with one in 294 females and one in 
69 males.
<P>
While Rosenberg's data don't look at risk factors, the explanation for 
the disparities is that male homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse 
(which is primarily male) continue to account for the vast majority of 
new infections.
<P>
Rosenberg's calculations also put to the lie the official government 
estimate of one million current infections.  He finds instead a range 
of 630,000 to 897,000 American living with the virus. 
<P>
To come up with these figures, Rosenberg used a technique called 
backcalculation.  It simply requires looking at the number of current 
AIDS cases and then calculates back from them to when the infections 
must have taken place.  From there it projects a trend line.
<P>
It's such a simple technique that you may be wondering why it took 
somebody so long to apply it to AIDS.  And the answer is that it 
didn't.  Joel Hay, then of the Hoover Institution and now the head of 
the Department of Pharmaceutical Economics at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, first applied backcalculation to the epidemic 
in 1988.  The figures he came up with, allowing for new infections in 
the years since,  are in the same ballpark as Rosenberg's figures.  
Hay's estimate was that there were as few as 500,000 infections at the 
time.
<P>
Hay's calculations were so appealingly simple and straightforward that 
I didn't hesitate to use them in my 1990 book, The Myth of 
Heterosexual AIDS.  But when Hay presented his data to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) at the international 
AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1988, the agency wanted nothing to do 
with them. 
<P>
At that time the CDC's official estimate was 1 to 1.5 million 
infections, which the media regularly shortened to "as many as 1.5 
million."  Ignoring Hay, the CDC relied on calculations by other 
modelers which had so many variables that they were virtual Rube 
Goldberg devices on paper.
<P>
That may have been part of their attraction.  Bureaucrats loathe 
simplicity.  But clearly a factor in the  CDC's decision was that 
Hay's numbers were just too darned low.
<P>
"They said, well, if the numbers just end up less than we say they 
are, we'll just pat ourselves on the back and say we helped prevent a 
major epidemic," says Hay now. 
<P>
Ultimately, as AIDS cases stubbornly refused to come in anywhere near 
as fast as the CDC had projected, the agency was forced to lower and 
finally abandon its projection of future AIDS cases and to lower its 
infection estimate to a flat one million.
<P>
Then last year its officials told the House Energy and Commerce 
Subcommittee on Health it was considering lowering that figure even 
more to 800,000.  But homosexual committee member Gerry Studds (D-
Mass.) threw a tantrum, and the officials ran away, tails tucked 
firmly between legs.  So the official figure remains at one million.
<P>
As for the tremendous disparity between male and female infections, 
and between those of whites and blacks, all that too was known long 
ago.  I emphasized these disparities in my first AIDS article way back 
in 1987 in Commentary magazine, adding that, "Every dollar spent, 
every commercial made, every health warning released, that does not 
specify [the actual risk factors for contracting AIDS] is a lie, a 
waste of funds and energy, and a cruel diversion."
<P>
Why then, in every year since 1987 has the CDC insisted on using its 
hundreds of millions of dollars allotted for "education" to air TV 
campaigns aimed squarely at white, middle class heterosexuals?  Quite 
simply to "democratize" the disease.  Specialty diseases get small, 
specialty budgets.  Diseases portrayed as threatening every last 
American get nice fat budgets, explaining why AIDS gets more research 
and education money than heart disease even though heart disease kills 
about 20 times as many Americans.
<P>
The media has eagerly played along, fearing that a disease which has 
<P>
homosexuals as its primary victims won't get the kind of attention the 
media has decided for us this disease deserves.
<P>
And still the propaganda continues.  The week after the Science report 
came out, ABC broadcast an afterschool special "Positive: A Journey 
into AIDS," featuring two soap opera actors whose characters have 
AIDS.  One is male, one female and both are middle class whites.
<P>
The result of denying the true risk factors? The people least at risk 
live in needless terror. The people most at risk become complacent and 
more likely to die before their time.

<i>12/21/95</i><hr><h2>The Government's Legal Theft Racket</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
 
Think you've had a hard week? Consider what happened to Mrs. Tina 
Bennis back in October of 1988.  One day she finds out that her 
husband,  appropriately named John, was arrested by Detroit police for 
having sex in a car with a prostitute. Then a few days later, adding  
insult to injury, the city seized the car as a "public nuisance." And 
it didn't give it back, even though the car was half Tina's.
<p>
If that sounds a bit unfair to you, you'll be interested to know that 
this isn't just some aberrational Detroit statute like those laws you 
hear about forbidding eating cherry pie in the bathtub on Sunday or 
some such. Indeed, property forfeiture laws are routinely employed by 
states and localities around the country as well as by the federal 
government. 
<p>
Under the federal and most state civil asset forfeiture statutes, law 
enforcement officials can seize a person's property without a notice 
or hearing if they merely have probable cause to believe it has 
somehow been involved in a crime. Proceeding against the property, the 
government need not file criminal charges against the owner or anyone 
else.  
<p>
Because of the fiction that the property is guilty, not the owner, 
cases to retrieve forfeited items have such quaint names as One 1958 
Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania and United States v. 1960 Bags of 
Coffee. (No information available on whether Mrs. Olson was called to 
testify.)
<p>
"Involvement" may mean anything from a belief that the property is 
contraband to a belief that it represents the proceeds of crime (even 
if it is in the hands of someone not suspected of a crime), that it is 
an instrument of crime, or that it somehow facilitates crime.
<p>
In one famous case the oceanographic research vessel Atlantis was 
seized off the coast of Massachusetts because a single marijuana 
cigarette was found in the ship's crew quarters.  In another, 
authorities seized a Scripps Oceanographic Institute research vessel 
because a marijuana cigarette was found in the locker of a sailor who 
had long since been fired.
<p>
But it appears that most forfeiture victims are not big guys like 
Scripps who can afford attorneys to take back their property, but 
average Janes and Joes.
<p>
Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Michigan Association for the 
Preservation of Property found that in 1992 Michigan law enforcement 
agencies used civil forfeiture in 9,770 instances, confiscating an 
average of only $1,434 per seizure. Property taken included 54 private 
homes with an average value of only $15,991 and 807 cars with an 
average value of merely $1,412.  Poor Tina Bennis's car was worth only 
$660.
<p>
While these confiscations were probably crushing to those who suffered 
them, they are not enough to justify the thousands of dollars it would 
take to hire an attorney to get the property back.  You see, once the 
property is seized, the burden is upon the owner to prove its 
"innocence."
<p>
As Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) points out in his 1995 book Forfeiting Our 
Property Rights, "In more than 80 percent of asset forfeiture cases 
the property owner is not even charged with a crime yet the government 
officials can and usually do keep the seized property."
<p>
One of the most pernicious aspects of civil forfeiture law is that the 
property seized often benefits the seizer. During the Holy 
Inquisition, many a person went to his or her death because some 
official coveted their property. Unfortunately, that's not entirely a 
thing of the past as the Donald Scott case shows.
<p>
In 1992, federal, state, and local law enforcement officials raided 
Scott's Malibu home on his 200 acre ranch under the pretense that he 
might be growing marijuana.  Brandishing a gun to stave off what he 
thought were criminal intruders, he was shot to death.
<p>
In fact, Scott was passionately anti-drug. His "crime" may have been 
his repeated refusal to sell his scenic ranch to the National Park 
Service. The Ventura County district attorney concluded that "the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was motivated, at least in part, 
by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government."
<p>
Civil forfeiture has allowed state and federal agencies to line their 
pockets with loot.  The amount deposited in the Department of 
Justice's Assets Forfeiture fund has increased from $27 million in 
1985 to $556 million in 1993. The Treasury Department's Forfeiture 
Fund took in $198 million in 1994.
<p>
Civil forfeiture needs to be seen for what it is, an end run around 
constitutional protections that begs for abuse. The notion that 
property can commit crimes is absurd. (Cars don't solicit prostitutes; 
people do.)
<p>
Forfeiture can be a valuable weapon in sucking the profits out of a 
criminal enterprise.  But the fair way to seize these is through 
something already on the books called criminal forfeiture. This 
procedure requires a criminal conviction before seizing property, 
eliminating much of the injustice of civil forfeiture.
<p>
True, this will eliminate those amusing case names like United States 
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms. People who thumb through court 
reports in search of humor will just have to get their kicks some 
other way. We need to fight crime without taking the lives of Malibu 
millionaires or the clunkers of Detroit housewives.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  EPA Hides Behind Myths of Love Canal -- 12/28/95</title></head>

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>EPA Hides Behind Myths of Love Canal</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P>
It closes a chapter in what has been called "the nation's most 
notorious toxic dumping case." The Occidental Chemical Corporation has 
agreed to pay $129 million to cover the federal government's cleanup 
costs at Love Canal, New York. The problem is that the federal 
officials, who like all victors are the ones who write the history, 
have written a history that has little connection with reality.
<P>
Under the settlement, the EPA Superfund will receive $102 and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handled the relocation of 
Love Canal residents and initial cleanup, will receive $27 million. 
(Last year, Occidental agreed to pay New York $98 million toward the 
cleanup of the site. The state originally sought $630 million in 
damages.)
<P>
"Today we celebrate a transformation of an environmental disaster 
called Love Canal into a success story," Attorney General Janet Reno 
said at a press conference announcing the settlement. "It stands for 
the principle that when people make a mess, they should pay to clean 
it up." 
<P>
Hmm . . . Does that mean that Miss Reno is going to go to Waco, Texas 
and roll up her sleeves and start picking up debris?
<P>
Nobody questions that Occidental, or rather its predecessor, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics Corp., buried 22,000 tons of chemical waste in a 
half-dug canal from 1942 to 1953. Rarely mentioned, however is that 
Hooker tried desperately to convince the city of Niagara Falls (where 
Love Canal is located) not to build on the site.
<P>
As consumer advocate Eric Zuesse pointed out in a 1981 Reason magazine 
article, the city school board applied massive pressure to obtain the 
land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health hazards.  
Finally Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar bill.  
It insisted, though, that the land was to be used for a school or 
parking lot or playground but was under no circumstances to be 
excavated.
<P>
Instead, the city decided to build a housing development on the site, 
digging into the protective clay covering and laying sewer lines 
through the waste.  Then it sold the plots to unsuspecting home 
buyers.
<P>
Hooker had no choice but to dump its toxic waste somewhere.  It was 
the city's choice to bring people to that somewhere. The bad guy 
wasn't the big faceless corporation, it was your friendly city 
government.
<P>
The second part of the Love Canal myth is that residents began 
suffering a health disaster in the late 1970s.  As I documented in my 
book Science Under Siege, nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmentalist reporter for 
the local paper began a series of articles telling the people that 
they were sitting on a toxic waste site.   Lo and behold, from then on 
every illness in the town was blamed on the ingredients brewing 
beneath the surface.  It even made national news when one family's dog 
began inexplicably vomiting.
<P>
The media descended upon the town and relayed to the outside world 
every sneeze, every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love 
Canal residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by 
toxic waste, which included the dreaded dioxin.
<P>
The EPA and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost.  Ultimately tens of millions of dollars were spent 
evacuating the residents.
<P>
Only later did the truth begin to seep out. Study after study 
conducted by the federal government and the State of New York 
Department of Health found that Love Canal residents had no more 
illness than would be expected in any other area of similar size.  
Believe it or not, dogs who don't live on top of toxic waste dumps 
also vomit.
<P>
A New York Times editorial predicted correctly in 1981 when it said, 
"it may well turn out that the public suffered less from the chemicals 
there than from the hysteria generated by flimsy research 
irresponsibly handled."
<P>
Somehow, none of this was mentioned at the aforementioned press 
conference. Instead, EPA Administrator Carol Browner used the myths of 
Love Canal to blast congressional Republican efforts to cut back on 
enforcement of environmental laws. Love Canal led to the creation of 
the Superfund for the cleanup of environmental hazards.
<P>
In seeking to reduce environmental spending by $25 million, she said, 
"Congress is attempting to roll back the environmental health 
protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
<P>
Since there was never any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously 
Superfund brought no protections there. In any case, it's too bad 
Browner didn't go farther to point out that Superfund, according to 
the Office of Technology Assessment, could soak up an amazing $500 
billion over the next few decades. While a few of these toxic waste 
<P>
sites may pose a real hazard to persons living nearby, most have posed 
no demonstrated threat as large even as making dogs upchuck.
<P>
Sometimes people fight back.  The citizens of Leadville, Colorado 
successfully fought the EPA's needless effort to scrape the lead out 
of Leadville's soil. (Anyone for "Ville" Colorado?). Like so much of 
what the EPA does, it was nothing but makework for a bloated and 
arrogant agency.

<center><h2>One Victim</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a> </center>
 <P>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

  
    Julie Welch, 23, didn't know that it was the last day of her life. 
She had plans for the future. She was preparing to quit her job as a 
claims agent for the Social Security department to take a job teaching 
Spanish at a local high school. 
<P>
     She was young and attractive. And, she was in love with a 
handsome, 24-year-old second lieutenant from a nearby Air Force base 
named Eric Hilz. They had talked about marriage, but that was still in 
the future. There was plenty of time -- they thought.
<P>
     The two had met at a Catholic prayer group for young adults at 
Tinker Air Force Base, according to news wire reports.  Last fall, on 
their first date, they went to the State Fair and rode the Ferris 
wheel. 
<P>
    On their final date, the Monday night before the Oklahoma City 
bombing, they went to dinner to celebrate Eric's 24th birthday. Julie 
gave him a prayer book, and they shared a bottle of champagne. The 
last time Eric saw her, after kissing her goodnight, she seemed happy, 
he said.
<P>
      Julie attended Mass every day, and went to Confession every 
week. She had a habit of praying the Rosary each evening, before going 
to bed. On the last night of her life, she probably didn't realize the 
full meaning of the words, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us 
sinners, now and at the hour of our death."
<P>
      She hadn't always been as ardent about her faith. Her father 
said she was lonely at college, and became depressed after living 
alone for the first time. That's when she started working on her 
relationship with God, praying daily, and frequenting the Sacraments. 
After graduation, she lost 40 pounds, and told her dad that she 
finally felt not only spiritually but physically fit.
<P>
     The morning of the Oklahoma City bombing, Julie attended the 7 
a.m. Mass at St. Charles, as always, before going to work at the 
federal building. 
<P>
     By 9 a.m., she was at her desk chatting with her supervisor. At 
9:02 she put down her glasses and went into the front office to greet 
her first customer of the day -- a Hispanic man who needed a 
disability check. 
<P>
     A moment later, the Social Security office was gone, demolished 
by a madman's bomb. About half of the 38 employees made it out alive, 
but not Julie.
<P>
     "She was too young," said her supervisor, Lorri McNiven, who woke 
up in darkness 30 minutes after the blast and was able to crawl from 
the twisted rubble to safety.
<P>
     Julie's parents got a call from the Coroner's office on Saturday 
morning. Their daughter's body had been identified. The grieving 
family said they considered themselves fortunate, because at least 
they can bury their child. Authorities say that some bodies were 
obliterated in the blast, and may never be recovered.
<P>
     To the world, Julie's life was unusual. Daily Mass, the Rosary, 
and weekly Confessions. She was happy, and at peace. It's not 
something the secular press can easily explain.
<P>
     At a time when the concept of womanhood has been redefined by the 
likes of Cosmopolitan Magazine to mean self-centeredness and self-
fulfillment, Julie was a contradiction.
<P>
      She kept her life God-centered, and wrapped herself in the 
Sacraments. She had her eyes on the ultimate prize: eternal happiness 
in Heaven.
<P>
     "We know there is no doubt her soul is in great shape. I feel a 
real sense of peace. I know everything is all right," her boyfriend, 
Eric, told reporters.

<center><h2>Fetal Tissue Consumption/Research</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley </a></center>
 <p>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

     News from the world of medicine: Chinese doctors think they have 
discovered something that cures asthma, restores health, and, at the 
same time, makes skin look years younger. 
<P>
     And, there's an abundant supply, which keeps the price down.
<P>
     Sounds too good to be true? Wait 'till you hear the rest. 
<P>
     The Eastern Express, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, 
broke the story on April 12, with details of the burgeoning practice 
of selling the bodies of aborted children, to be used as health food. 
Since then, the story has been picked up by the Wall Street Journal, 
the Washington Times, United Press International, and it's been shown 
on CNN. 
<P>
     Now, Republicans are demanding that the Clinton administration 
investigate, and they're planning to hold hearings in the House of 
Representatives.
<P>
     Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, said the new 
allegations could result in a Congressional call for the United States 
to revoke "Most Favored Nation" trade status for China -- a privilege 
granted by President Clinton despite the manifold allegations of human 
rights abuses in China.
<P>
     This is a nauseating topic -- true. But it's a story that needs 
to be told, just as the shocking crimes of the Holocaust needed to be 
laid bare for the world to see.
<P>
     Zou Qin, 32, a doctor at the Luo Hu abortuary in Shenzhen, China, 
told the Eastern Express reporter that she has eaten more than 100 
fetuses in the past six months, and described them as "highly 
nutritious." The story included a picture of her holding a jar 
containing the tiny body of an aborted child.
<P>
     The doctor said: 
<P>
     "They are wasted if we don't eat them. The women who receive 
abortions here don't want the fetuses. Also, the fetuses are already 
dead (when we eat them). We don't carry out abortions just to eat the 
fetuses."
<P>
     Sound familiar? That's the same argument used by Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, Rep. Joseph Kennedy, and cohorts, to justify fetal research 
in America. 
<P>
     So, before you allow the shock to settle in, ask yourself: what's 
the difference? The Chinese are eating unborn children as health food. 
We're cannibalizing their body parts in the name of "science." 
<P>
     And, during the presidential campaign, Clinton used the same 
logic as Dr. Zou Qin, almost verbatim, when he was asked whether he 
supported experimenting on aborted humans. 
<P>
     They'd only go to waste, Clinton said. Fetal research is going to 
help people and relieve their suffering, he said. No one bothered to 
ask him: at what cost?
<P>
     In fact, one of Clinton's first acts after being sworn in as 
president was to revoke the ban on using tax dollars to fund fetal 
research. That's right: your hard-earned money is being used, right 
now, to pay for it.
<P>
     But, when fetal research is reported on the network news in 
America, it's with a positive spin. The film footage typically shows 
sufferers who allegedly have been restored to health after undergoing 
treatment that involved the injection of fetal brain cells into their 
damaged brains. 
<P>
     Not one word about the tiny human beings who were used, without 
their consent, as donors.
<P>
     Like the Chinese, scientists in America prefer older, more 
developed fetuses. The Eastern Express story reported that full-term 
fetuses were more desirable and more expensive in China -- because 
they were considered more nutritious.  
<P>
     In the world of Western medical research, mature fetuses are more 
desirable, too, because the organs are more developed. 
<P>
     There's one difference, though. The Chinese use dead babies. In 
America, some of the experimentation involves removing parts from live 
babies, before killing and aborting them. 
<P>
     If you have a hard time believing that, read the scientific 
papers that describe the procedures. Or, just ask yourself: would any 
doctor inject dead fetal brain cells into the brain of a Parkinson's 
sufferer? No. The brain cells have to be living, or they're no good.
<P>
     Could any dead fetal organs be used in medical experiments that 
involve transplantation into living adults? No. 
<P>
     Or, ask yourself: would any fetal body parts be usable after 
being subjected to a standard abortion procedure? Once again, the 
answer is, no.
<P>
     So, before we get on our high horse and start pointing at the 
Chinese in disgust, let's remember what we tolerate in America.
<P>
     In the end, the blame doesn't rest solely with the American 
researchers who do the grisly deeds. It also rests on the people who 
allow it to happen, by looking the other way.
<P>
     If you're inflamed by what's going on in China, take some of that 
indignation and use it to combat cannibalism on our own soil. Speak 
for those who have no voice.
<P>

<h2>When It Comes To School, Mother Knows Best </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley</b>
<p>
I visited a friend recently, and was a bit surprised to see her nine- year-old son, Anthony, with his nose buried in a thick volume of Shakespeare's complete works.  
<p> 
"He's re-writing Hamlet in simpler language, and he's going to direct the play, with his sister and his cousins playing most of the parts," my friend explained.   
 <p>
Anthony looked up, for a moment, from his work.  
 <p>
"I'm going to be Hamlet," he said, with excitement.  
 <p>
But, of course. How silly of me to be even a bit surprised that a young boy's imagination would be captivated by the image of Hamlet -- the sword-wielding Prince of Denmark.  
 <p>
But, Shakespeare at nine? Or, even more astounding, a boy who voluntarily reads Shakespeare during his summer vacation?  
 <p>
My friend, who home schools both of her children, said Anthony was exposed to a bit of the classics as part of his English curriculum, and went galloping after the Bard on his own initiative during the school year.  
<p>
"It's nice that he has the freedom to really explore a subject that catches his interests," she said.  
 <p>
Other home schooling mothers have told me that their kids begin reading at an earlier age, and have a chance to learn in ways that fit their personalities. And, parents can choose a curriculum that gives their kids an education that emphasizes the basics, rather than the flavor-of-the-month approach to teaching.  
 <p>
Speaking as one who was interminably bored with the slow pace of the various public and Catholic schools I attended, I'm a bit jealous.  
 <p>
Home schooling is beginning to come of age. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that about 500,000 children -- more than one percent of all school-age children -- are schooled at home. Advocates place the figure at twice that. And, research shows that home schoolers are growing by as much as 40 percent a year -- fueled by the crumbing public school system, high tuition for private schools, and  
the increasing number of liberal Catholic schools that teach dissent to their young charges.  
<p>
Even the media is beginning to come around. Last October, Time Magazine ran a cover story that described the home schooling trend, albeit with a back-hand slap at Christians:  
<p>
"A movement once reserved largely for misanthropes, missionaries and religious fundamentalists now embraces such a range of families that it has become a mainstream alternative to regular public or private education," it stated.  
<p>
High profile examples, such as the Colfax family of Boonville, California, have helped to change the image of home schoolers. In 1987 Grant Colfax was accepted to Harvard University after being home schooled for his entire life. He graduated magna cum laude, became a Fulbright scholar, and graduated from Harvard Medical School. One-by-one, his home-schooled siblings followed in his footsteps to Harvard.   
 <p>
Advocates point to the fact that almost all of our early national leaders were home schooled. They'll tell you the kids get plenty of socialization, ranging from play groups where younger students mingle with other home-schooled children, to sports and theater groups for the older kids.  
<p>
What's more, in an age when family connections have never been weaker, they say that the one-on-one teaching inevitably strengthens the parent/child bond, and, as a result, imbues their kids with self-confidence and maturity.  
<p>
There is no doubt that home-schooled children have an academic  advantage over their group-schooled peers. In several studies over the last decade they score in the 65th to 80th percentile on standardized test. The national average is the 50th percentile.  
<p>
On the other hand, opponents such as the left-leaning National Education
Association, the union representing 2.2 million public school teachers, decry home schooling, saying it provides an "inadequate educational experience."  
<p>
In other words, no chance to tell the kids about condoms. No opportunity to show the students graphic pictures in their state-approved quest to promote sexual activity. No way to get the nihilistic message across that kids have no control over themselves.   
<p>
And, no opportunity to instill their version of values, meaning "yes" to recycling, and "no" to chastity, prudence, temperance, and faith.  
<p>
Do home-schooled kids miss out on something essential? Naw. I'd say it's the other way around.   
 <p>
It's the public school kids, who only get to be part of a family for the few hours between dinner and bedtime, who are missing out.

<title>Opus Dei</title>

<h2>Opus Dei</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley </b>
<p> 
<p>
It has always puzzled me that Catholics who believe and accept the 
full teachings of the Catholic Church are labeled "Conservative" or 
"orthodox," while dissenting members who support, say, only two out of 
every 10 teachings -- on a good day -- are just called plain, old 
"Catholic." 
<p>
If anyone deserves an adjective, shouldn't it be those who reject the 
Christ-given Magisterial teaching authority of the Holy See? Shouldn't 
it be the ones who proudly declare their opposition to the Chair of 
Peter? 
<p>
Well, that's not the way it works in the 1990s. If all you do is 
support the basic teachings of the ancient faith -- not one iota more, 
nor one jot less -- sooner or later, you're gonna get a negative 
label.  
<p>
Thus, it's no surprise that the Chicago archdiocese announced in May 
that it would refuse to sell an unused college seminary to Opus Dei 
for a reported $8.75 million.  
<p>
Opus Dei, a canonically-approved Personal Prelature of the Church 
established by -- and widely praised by -- John Paul II, wanted to use 
the facility as the new site of Northridge Preparatory School, an all-
boys high school. 
<p>
Several archdiocesan groups voted to reject the sale because, in their 
words, Opus Dei is an elitist, secretive organization that has too 
much power in Rome -- you know, all the things that people used to say 
about the Jesuits.  
<p>
Months later, there are no other interested buyers. Like many disused 
Catholic facilities, the seminary may eventually be sold to an Eastern 
sect, or a New Age group. Or, perhaps it will be sub-divided as 
condos, with the chapel that was once used for the Holy Sacrifice of 
the Mass turned into a club house. Just as long as Opus Dei doesn't 
get it. 
<p>
Admittedly, Opus Dei has an image problem. Secular newspapers 
regularly run negative stories about it. Liberals in the Catholic 
Church disdain the world-wide group, founded almost 70 years ago by a 
Spanish priest beautified in 1992.  
<p>
Why? In part, because Opus Dei doesn't preach dissent, or New Age 
theology, or goddess worship. All it does is urge its mostly-lay 
members to grow in personal holiness, and to serve the Catholic Church 
as it wishes to be served. 
<p>
It's a novel concept, isn't it? Rather than following the current 
fashion of insisting upon serving Our Lord according to our own whims, 
they want to do things His way. 
<p>
Opus Dei, Latin for the "Work of God," shares some similarities with 
the much older, but lesser-known, Congregation of the Oratory, founded 
in the sixteenth century by St. Philip Neri. 
<p>
Both stick to the basics of the faith. Both are unwaveringly in their 
fidelity to the Roman Pontiff. And, both focus on giving the working 
man and woman the spiritual food they need to bring the light of 
Christ into the world -- namely, the Sacraments of the Catholic 
Church. 
<p>
And, in modern times, both have been persecuted, because of it. 
<p>
If you're looking for an example, read "The Last Roman Catholic?" by 
James Demers. He recounts the smear campaign that led up to the 1989 
expulsion of the Oratorians from the archdiocese of Ottawa, in Canada. 
<p>
The congregation was asked by Archbishop Joseph Plourde to take over a 
crumbling church in the poorest section of Ottawa. They started 
rebuilding the church, beginning with the Mass. No more ad-libbed 
Consecrations -- just the liturgy of the Roman Rite of the Catholic 
Church.  
<p>
Within six months, the pews of the church were filled with Catholics 
who traveled great distances to experience the reverence and piety of 
the Mass. A local choir was trained in the singing of Gregorian Chant 
and polyphony. Several doctrine classes began meeting regularly, and 
an architectural restoration project was underway. 
<p>
As you might imagine, the liberals who dominated the archdiocese were 
inflamed. They had been slogging away, day in and day out, with their 
faddish twists to the Mass and their voguish theology. But, the pews 
of their churches, and their parish collection boxes, were slowly 
emptying out. 
<p>
The Oratorians were labeled "ultra-conservative" -- even though their 
only crime was to preach the full wealth of the Catholic faith. They 
were called "divisive" -- despite the fact that their only concern was 
their Father's business -- hearing Confessions, celebrating Mass, and 
instructing their parishioners in the basics of the faith. 
<p>
Eventually, the church was taken away from them, and their 
parishioners set adrift. 
<p>
It's too bad that Catholic liberals are so intolerant. But, they are 
correct to fear both the Oratorians and Opus Dei. Any group that helps 
Catholic laypeople lead lives of old-fashioned sanctity ought to be 
dreaded by the church-busters on the left. 
<p>
For, such is the stuff that builds faith, and spawns strong Catholic 
families, with offspring who have sound vocations and deeply held 
convictions -- just the attributes that it will take to restore the 
Catholic Church in America and defeat the apostles of Modernism.

<title>Walt Disney Co. -Porn pushers</title>

<h2>Walt Disney Co. - Porn pushers</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
Wall Street was dazzled by the recent $19 billion merger of Walt 
Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC -- the second-largest take-over 
in history. 
<p>
Pundits said it was a good deal for the American entertainment 
industry. But, something tells me that 'ol Walt is rolling over in his 
grave.  
<p>
Not because ABC has a reputation for in-your-face bad taste. Yes, 
these are the people who gave us the jaw-dropping venom of Roseanne, 
and the steaming story lines of NYPD Blue, billed as television's 
first R-rated series. 
<p>
And, you'll notice that through it all, ABC continues to bill 
themselves as the "family station." 
<p>
But, the problem isn't with ABC. It's with Disney. 
<p>
When it comes to down-and-dirty porn pushers, you won't find many who 
have stooped as low as the Walt Disney Company has over the past year. 
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the R-rated anti-Catholic movie "Priest," 
described in one magazine as having "the best gay sex scenes in a non-
pornographic film."  
<p>
It's much worse than that. It's a movie called "Kids," recently 
released by Disney's wholly-owned subsidiary, Miramax -- the same 
people who gave us "Priest." 
<p>
It details the sexual experiences of 13- to 16-year-old New York 
teenagers. And, it's not a pretty picture.  
<p>
According to Reuters and the Associated Press, even a few hard-to-faze 
movie reviewers looked a bit taken aback as they left a pre-release 
showing at the Cannes film festival several months ago.  
<p>
One critic branded it "kiddie porn." The board who rates Hollywood 
movies agreed with him. 
<p>
They gave it an NC-17 rating, the new category that means not quite an 
X-rated movie, but almost. Miramax, fearing the stigma of an NC-17 
rating, chose to release the film unrated, which means it won't be 
running in as many theaters, but will still make the full rounds of 
video stores in its afterlife. 
<p>
The film opens with the main character, a promiscuous skateboarding 
teen named Telly, having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Later, he 
relates the entire scene in vulgar details to his buddy. As it turns 
out, seducing virgins is Telly's idea of "safe sex." 
<p>
It gets worse. Reviewers report that during a party sequence filled 
with explicit sex, a teenage girl passes out, high on drugs, and is 
raped by one of Telly's friends. 
<p>
Yes, that's right. This is the Walt Disney Company we're talking about 
-- the same people who created "101 Dalmations."  
<p>
Now, they've joined the lowest segment of the America media, intent on 
warping the minds of teenagers by linking sex with violence. 
<p>
"Kids" is showing in major cities across the country. And, it's a 
qualified hit. When it premiered, it broke the house records for 
weekend box office grosses at two New York City theaters.  
<p>
There have been a few naysayers, but most reviewers have been positive 
-- probably the same ones who praised "Priest."  
<p>
First-time director Larry Clark, 53, is getting plenty of media 
attention for "Kids." A July 26 profile in the New York Times 
reported: "The success of the film is allowing Mr. Clark to plan 
future movies."  
<p>
The profile doesn't mention Clark's well-documented background as a 
kiddie porn photographer. You have to read a publication such as the 
July issue of the "American Family Association Journal" to get the 
revolting details on that. (P.O. Drawer 2440, Tupelo, MS 38803) 
<p>
Clark is already talking about beginning his next film, which will 
focus on kids, sex, and suicide -- a theme that reoccurs in many of 
his porn photographs. He says he sees the new film as part two of a 
trilogy. 
<p>
So, why is Disney giving a platform to a psychopath? Because Clark's 
film is going to make money. That's why Disney dropped its standards 
almost a decade ago and began making R-rated films, hiding behind 
subsidiary companies. The long list of Disney-funded R-rated films 
seems tame, now, compared to their new ventures. 
<p>
Money. That's all that interests Disney chairman Michael Eisner, 
described by the New York Times as "one of the most ferociously 
ambitious people in Hollywood." 
<p>
Money enough to buy a television network, and create a media empire. 
Money enough to earn Eisner more than $10 million in salary and 
bonuses last year. 
<p>
Poor Mickey. Once, he was the most respectable mouse in the world. 
Now, he works for a porn pusher.

<title>UN World Conference on Women</title>

<center><h2>U.N. World Conference on Women</h2>
<p>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
Do you know the five genders? It's a widely-held tenet among 
radical feminists in America that there are at least five, if not 
more. And, they say, it's perfectly normal to flit between several of 
them during a course of a lifetime.
<p>
Typically, they are classified as: lesbian, male homosexual, 
transgender, and, for the less enlightened among us, male and female.
<p>
Geraldine Ferraro, the one-time Democratic vice-presidential 
candidate, is an ardent feminist and a radical pro-abort, yet she 
claims to have never heard about the new gender-speak -- despite the 
fact that it's standard fare in any run-of-the-mill college or 
university Women's Studies department.
<p>
Ferraro led the American delegation at the recent meeting to 
finalize the platform for the U.N.'s World Conference on Women in 
September -- where the definition of gender is guaranteed to be a 
ticking time bomb.
<p>
"I'm nearly 60 years old, and I don't know what the five genders 
are," said Ferraro, trying to deflect criticism about the feminist 
manipulation of the conference's lengthy draft statement.
<p>
In the official document, the word "gender" is mentioned more than 
200 times, often in a convoluted fashion, in sentences that beg for 
the use of the words "male and female." 
<p>
In fact, if you read the document, available on the Internet at 
the U.N. web site, it may raise the same suspicions that bothered 
delegates from Honduras, Guatemala and the Sudan. They were the first 
to object to the repetitive and somewhat odd use of the term, but 
later agreed to drop the issue until the main conference meets in 
Beijing.
<p>
You won't find the words "motherhood," "wife," or "family" 
mentioned in the official document, except for a handful of occasions, 
when they are referenced in a negative context as a means of 
oppressing women. 
<p>
Or, they've been put in brackets, which means that delegates 
objected to their use, and plan to remove them during the final 
revisions in Beijing.
<p>
The anti-fertility forces have had a spree during the drafting of 
the document. Abortion and the wide-spread use of dangerous chemical 
contraceptives, as well as sterilization, are held up, repeatedly, as 
among the most precious "rights" of women. 
<p>
Perhaps some day it will dawn on these meddlesome, middle-class, 
First World do-gooders that women from developing countries actually 
LIKE babies. I saw it with my own eyes, when I spent a year in West 
Africa.
<p>
They value new life. Not because it's another set of hands in the 
fields. But, because they believe that life is a precious gift -- and 
they don't have too many other bright spots in their difficult lives. 
<p>
I know such life-loving ideas are difficult for some First World 
brains to comprehend. We're always trying to think of new ways to 
relieve those poor women of the burden of motherhood. We, the minority 
of the world's population, believe that we know what's best for those 
underprivileged people who form the majority of the world's population 
-- in brief, we still believe in Colonialism.
<p>
But, they don't want our abortion clinics and our contraceptives. 
They want safe drinking water, simple drugs to help their children 
when they fall ill, and some economic opportunities for their 
families. 
<p>
And, there are many people in America who sympathize with them -- 
in fact, the majority. Sadly, the women from developing countries may 
never know this. 
<p>
Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America, a 
conservative women's organization that is four times larger than the 
National Organization for Women, railed against the false image 
presented by the Clinton Administration's decision to send ultra-left 
Old Guard feminist extremists to Beijing..
<p>
"This conference is completely dominated by radical feminists. In 
the name of 'Equality, Development, and Peace,' this Beijing 
conference will be a taxpayer-funded promotion of abortion, 
lesbianism, and other left-wing crusades, such as disarmament, radical 
environmentalism, and socialism, that have nothing to do with helping 
women," she said.
<p>
We all know it's a travesty to hold a women's conference in a 
country that routinely practices forced abortions, mandatory 
sterilization of women, and female infanticide. It's a scandal to be 
the guest of a government that has a long record of imprisoning men 
and women in slave labor camps without trial, forcing them to make 
goods for export.
<p>
It's a joke to discuss the dignity of human beings in a country 
where possessing a Bible is a crime against the state, and where 
hundreds of Catholics priests have been imprisoned and tortured -- 
including three Catholic bishops who are still in prison, and three 
Catholic bishops who were tortured and beaten to death in 1991 and 
1992.
<p>
Yes, we know it's a travesty. But, the average woman in developing 
countries may not realize that the left-wing U.S. delegates do not 
speak for us. 
<p>
She'll be left to wonder about a world that sends her planeloads 
of contraceptives, but leaves her without access to simple anti-
malarial drugs.

<center><h2>Remembering V-J Day</center></h2>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a></center> 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
In all the controversy surrounding the 50th anniversary of the 
dropping of the atomic bomb on the weapons factories of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, there's been a bit of the human element that has been lost 
on one side of the debate.
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the fate of the 195,000 people who were 
killed or injured in those congested cities. Their tragic story has 
been told, as well it should. 
<p>
The world has not forgotten them.
<p>
But, what about the fate of the U.S. forces poised off the coast 
of Japan, ready to launch an invasion that was certain to produce the 
heaviest casualties of World War II?
<p>
It's easy, 50 years later, to disagree about projected fatality 
figures. Would there have been 80,000 American losses during the inch-
by-inch fighting for Japanese soil, or 180,000, or 300,000, or more? 
In recent weeks, the guests on the Sunday morning talk show seem to 
preen themselves as they dispassionately debate the issue. 
<p>
But, meanwhile, the men who were on those ships, and their 
families, have a different view of history. It's a more gripping sense 
of what might have been.
<p>
I know, because my father, Michael J. Howley, was part of that 
invasion force. He was, then, a somewhat-scrawny, 18-year-old Radarman 
First Class on the U.S.S. Akutan, an ammunition ship that was 
responsible for re-supplying the front-line battleships with shells 
and bullets. 
<p>
In the brutal, island-hopping campaigns that brought the U.S. 
forces to the shores of Japan, the Navy's job was to launch massive 
bombardments before each landing in an attempt to pave the way for the 
Marines. At the same time, the ships had to defend themselves against 
enemy fighter pilots and suicidal kamikaze attacks.
<p>
Dad enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, fresh out of Boston 
College High School. At first, his parents objected, saying he was too 
young. But, in the end, they signed the document required for under-
aged recruits, and sent their son to fight for their adopted country.
<p>
By August of 1945, he was a veteran of the Liberation of the 
Philippines, and, a more searing memory, the Battle of Okinawa, where 
the U.S. Navy experienced some of the heaviest losses of the war. 
<p>
He never had to worry about being crippled or maimed. All it took 
to incinerate an ammo ship was one well-placed bullet, or one 
successful kamikaze plane. 
<p>
In fact, in the final months of war, the U.S.S. Mt. Hood, also an 
"AE," or ammunition supplier, went down with all hands lost, with the 
exception of an officer and a squad of sailors who were on a nearby 
island. The explosion of the ship's 8,800 tons of bombs blew a 300-
foot-long crater in the ocean floor.
<p>
To acknowledge the awesome destructive power contained within the 
hulls of the AEs, the Navy named all of them, in the World War II 
years, after volcanoes.
<p>
When we were young, the only specifics Dad ever told us about the 
war were the funny stories, like the time he was on shore patrol and 
was ordered to arrest a group of sailors, who turned out to be his 
shipmates.
<p>
And, there was also the amusing detail about the "little white 
lie" he told his mother, who was home in Boston praying unending 
Rosaries for her two sons in uniform -- one, my uncle, in the Army, 
and, the other, my Dad.
<p>
"Mamie," an Irish name for "mother," spent the war years believing 
my father was on a low-level supply ship in the backwaters of the 
Pacific. To support this subterfuge, he filled his letters with 
imaginary details of how many blankets they had transported, and how 
bored he was.
<p>
"I didn't want her to worry more than she already did," he 
explained. 
<p>
Every year, at the anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and 
Hiroshima, the media focuses on one angle: the plight of the citizens 
of those two cities.
<p>
But the historical context, the backdrop for the decision to drop 
the bomb, seems to have been lost. 
<p>
There has been little mention of the fact that the Japanese were 
working on their own A-bomb, or that they had a habit of placing 
armament factories in residential areas, or that the citizens of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were warned by U.S. leaflet drops to flee their 
homes, or that our prisoners of war were starving to death as they 
waited for liberation.
<p>
Most of all, we seem to have forgotten the plight of the thousands 
of soldiers and sailors -- many of them teenagers -- who waited 
onboard the ships of the American invasion fleet.
<p>
Whether you believe the lowball figures put forth by today's 
revisionists, or the higher figures accepted as fact in 1945, the 
bottom line is: vast numbers of those young men would not have 
survived the Battle of Japan.
<p>
They would have have missed their chance to live their lives, to 
have families, and to grow old.
<p>
Surely, their stories deserve some mention.

<title>Did My Parents Want Me</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center>
<h2>Did My Parents WANT Me?</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">Kathleen Howley</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
A woman, in her mid-40s, recently told me that she grew up with the 
feeling that her parents didn't want her.<p>  
She said she overheard, one night, a comment made by her mother, who 
didn't realize that little ears were listening. It referred to the 
conception of her daughter as being the result of "one drink too 
many." <p> 
It was meant as a joke. And, my friend reports that all the adults who 
heard it laughed. But she wasn't laughing.  <p>
In fact, that one comment, with perhaps, the subtle reinforcement of 
other stray remarks, haunted her for years. <p>
Oh, sure, her parents fed her and clothed her and sent her to school, 
and even went to "parent/teacher" nights -- the things that to all the 
world make people look like loving and caring parents. <p>
And, for all I know, they could have been exactly that. My friend 
wouldn't have disputed that possibility.  <p>
But, she wasn't talking about the love that almost any normal adult 
can learn to feel about a cute and cuddly baby.  <p>
She was talking about the deep-down questions that all children ponder 
as they learn about the world they live in:  <p>
When I was called into being, when I was created, did my parents WANT 
me? When I was thrust into this strange, new world, was there someone 
yearning for my arrival?  <p>
Somehow, if the answer to that question is , "Yes," it makes 
everything else easier. It covers a multitude of later lapses and 
human failings.  <p>
I suppose that it's much like arriving at the door of an important 
party knowing that you are an invited guest, as compared to walking 
toward the front steps without an invitation.  <p>
Of course, we all know that the most important Being of all, the 
Creator of the Universe, wanted each and every one of us to be born.  <p>
In fact, it's more than that. The Father not only loved us and called 
us into being. He also gave each of us a crucial job to do during our 
lifetime on earth -- a job that, whether great or small, is infinitely 
important in His plan. <p>
In adult life, that fact can be a great comfort. But, it seems that 
children need more.  <p>
Today, we live in a world that is ruled with a contraceptive 
mentality. It's a stingy philosophy that says, yes, children are a 
good thing, but only give me, at most, two of them. Any more than 
that, and they become a bad thing. <p>
How, I wonder, do today's children feel, growing up in a family with 
the knowledge that they barely made it under the wire. Just two. No 
more. We have no more love to give. <p>
Even if you're number one or two, you know that the love you receive 
from your parents is conditional. "We love you, because you happen to 
arrive when you did." <p>
Someone was ranting to me, recently, that people shouldn't have more 
than two children. <p>
I asked her: <p>
"Where do you fall in the birth order of your family?" <p>
She answered: <p>
"I'm the fourth child." <p>
Good thing her parents didn't agree with her ideas. Else, she never 
would have existed. <p>
I'm the second child in my family. Lucky me. I would have been born, 
even if my parents subscribed to a contraceptive mentality. Although, 
my little sisters would have been left out in the cold. <p>
Fortunately, I have the great gift of knowing that my parents wanted 
as many children as God would give them. That gave us Howley kids a 
jump start in life. We were wanted, yearned for, rejoiced over. Every 
one of us. <p>
But what about today's children, who live in families that have a 
stingy attitude toward life? Maybe God wanted more. Maybe He intended 
that third kid to be one who introduced the first kid to the woman he 
would marry, or got a job for kid number two when he got out of 
college. Or, maybe it was that fifth kid who was going to care for the 
parents when they were elderly. <p>
The fact is, it's not unconditional love for a couple to use chemicals 
to ensure that only one or two children are born. You can argue that 
it shows greater love to have just two children, and be able to 
provide them with every material asset. The best kindergarten, the 
best college.  <p>
Problem is, maybe they won't want to go to college. Maybe they'd 
prefer to have a brother, rather than a new car for their high school 
graduation. <p>
Mother Theresa said it best. In news accounts, she was quoted as 
saying, "In America, children have every material thing, but they are 
very lonely, because they don't have brothers or sisters to play 
with." <p>
So, when you have that third child, or fourth, or more, and people 
start raising eyebrows, asking, "How MANY are you going to have?" -- 
just answer, " I don't know, you'll have to ask God. He has a plan." <p>

<title>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellow</title>

<center><h3>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellows</h3><br>
By<br><a href="townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a><p>
<hr></center> 
<P>
 
The fat lady has yet to sing. With Democrats continuing to desert 
their party in droves, especially on the state level, the political 
drubbing that began with the November elections is going into extra 
innings. 
<P>
Almost every week, the newspapers carry stories of Democrats who have 
decided either to switch, or to quit. 
<P>
The political concept of Liberalism -- spelled with a capital "L" -- 
is dead, at least for this millennium. No longer will government 
simply give handouts as the solution to every problem. No longer can 
the media merrily assume to represent the views of all Americans when 
they postulate that freedom in America equals life without values. 
<P>
But, before Republican leaders get too euphoric about the all-out 
rout, it would be wise to remember that politics makes strange 
bedfellows.  
<P>
Some of their staunchest supports today are people who don't really 
fit into the Republican party, or the Democratic party. They are 
called: Catholic voters. 
<P>
 Of the 250 million people in America, 95 million, or two out of every 
five, are Roman Catholic. Sure, some of them have fallen away from the 
faith, for now -- after all, the Church has not been immune from the 
devastating effects of the "Just-Me" philosophy that hit society in 
the 1960s.  
<P>
 But, despite the biased polls you'll occasionally see in the 
newspapers, most remain firm supporters of Catholic teachings 
regarding the value of life and the family. 
<P>
 At the moment, the Republicans are best representing their views. 
Forty years ago, it was the Democrats. The mass of Catholic voters 
switched once. They can switch again. 
<P>
 Probably, that doesn't make too many Republicans quake in their 
boots. Of the two parties, they are the most pro-life, they'll tell 
you. They have the best ideas for restoring the strength of the 
family. They have a common-sense and value-based approach to 
education.  
<P>
 But, every once in a while, an issue comes along that makes the 
typical Catholic voter extremely ill-at-ease with the standard 
Republican party line. 
<P>
Immigration is one -- in a big way. Most Catholic voters are 
descendants of turn-of-the-century immigrants. True, it makes good 
sense to secure our borders and to crack down on illegal immigration -
- as long as that doesn't mean punishing the innocent children of 
illegals. 
<P>
 However, many Catholics will tell you that America must never close 
her doors to legal immigration, or develop a stingy attitude toward 
it, lest we lose our vigor and make a lie of the Statue of Liberty: 
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath 
free." 
<P>
 And, here's another issue: immoral labor practices. 
<P>
 No, I'm not going to hop on the media bandwagon and tell you that the 
big, bad Republicans only care about making a buck. I'm not going to 
even mention country clubs.  
<P>
 But, the fact is, the Republican party seems ever-ready to put the 
laborer at the mercy of the corporate decision-makers. If they want to 
hold on to their Catholic supporters, they are going to have to knock 
it off. 
<P>
  During recent months, the National Labor Committee in New York has 
sponsored a cross-country tour for two teenagers to tell the world of 
their experiences in the garment sweatshops of Honduras and El 
Savador, assembling high-priced clothes for The Gap, Banana Republic, 
Eddie Bauer, Sears, and Gitano, a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom. 
<P>
  In these tax-free factories, built specifically to produce goods for 
the U.S. and Canadian markets, children and young women work shifts 
that sometimes exceed18 hours, for below-subsistence wages. The abuses 
they recount are mind-numbing. 
<P>
 Of course, the corporate bigwigs deny all of it. But, if you ask me 
who I'm going to believe -- Donald Fisher, who was paid more than $2 
million last year to run the Gap empire, or Judith Viera, an 18-year-
old who made 56 cents an hour and was limited to two bathroom trips a 
shift --- hummm....who would you believe? 
<P>
Judith, by the way, was fired when she tried to help organize a union. 
For good measure, the big boss also threw out her three sisters, just 
because they were related. 
<P>
 On her last 18-hour shift on the production line, Judith said they 
were sewing Eddie Bauer T-shirts. The crew included two workers who 
were only 15 years old. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, the House's Trade Subcommitee approved a bill 
introduced by Republican Phillip Crane to increase the tariff breaks 
for products entering the U.S. from sweatshops in the Central American 
and the Caribbean by $240 million.  
<P>
 Remember the giant sucking sound? H.R. 553 means it will only get 
louder, with more American companies being wooed by the prospects of 
33-cents-an-hour wages and laborers who are vulnerable to 
exploitation. 
<P>
 Currently, the bill has been set aside. But, seeing as Fruit of the 
Loom is a six-figure contributor to the RNC, and The Gap lags not far 
behind with a hefty five-figure donation, H.R. 553 may not be dead for 
long. 
<P>
 Yes, politics does make strange bedfellows, indeed. 
 <P>

<title>You must learn to forgive</title>

<center><h2>You Must Learn To Forgive You</h2><p>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

Only in this day and age could a magazine devote an entire, 2,600-word 
article to the subject of confession, and not once mention the word 
"God." <p>

Cosmopolitan did it, in their August issue. The gist of the story was: 
the highest aim in life is to obtain self-forgiveness. <p>

That's right. YOU must learn to forgive YOU. Confess your sins to 
yourself, or to a pal. No need to submit yourself to divine authority. 
Learn how to erase your guilt. Just get rid of it.  <p>

Silly you for feeling guilty in the first place.<p>  

Don't change your habits. Don't even consider the possibility that 
there is such a thing as absolute, immutable truth, or that some 
actions are intrinsically wrong -- or that feelings of actual guilt, 
as opposed to imagined or neurotic guilt, exist for a good reason. <p>

Don't ponder the idea that Hell could, indeed, be real, whether you 
believe in it or not. <p>

Just get to a good therapist, and work through your feelings.<p> 

I suppose that's a much easier route than asking for God's 
forgiveness, which requires an acknowledgment of His authority, true 
repentance, and an earnest resolution to try to sin no more. <p>

That would be life-changing. Earthshaking, in fact.  <p>

I'd wager a guess that the average Cosmo subscriber is nowhere near 
taking that first step. But, without God's absolution, they're just 
changing seats on the Titanic.<p> 

Forgiving yourself may, in fact, give temporary relief. But, until God 
forgives you, your deeds will always exist, if only in the deepest 
recesses of your mind, and, certainly, in your soul. <p>

Without His supernatural grace, dispensed through the Sacrament of 
Penance, they can never be cast "as far as the east is from the west." <p>

Sin, or "guilt," as Cosmo phrased it, "can torment you, make you sick 
-- even weaken your body's immune system." <p>

The article, titled "Are Guilty Secrets Haunting Your Life?" goes on: 
"People often become immobilized, whether they know it or not, unable 
to get on with their lives until they tell the truth." <p>

Ahh, is that all it takes? Having an honest chat with a friend, or 
spending $100 an hour for a therapist? Following Cosmo's logic, 
America should be the healthiest, happiest county in the world.  <p>

After all, is there any self-help route we haven't tried? Is there a 
new therapy technique we've passed up? <p>

Have we left anything unsaid? Is there any topic -- any? -- that 
hasn't been discussed in full detail on Oprah or other TV shows? <p>

And yet, America seems, on the whole, to be much more depressed, 
guilt-ridden, and lonely -- compared to, say, a time when we were a 
God-fearing country.<p> 

No. There's a lot more to healing the deadly effects of sin than just 
telling someone about it.<p>  

There's nothing wrong with therapy, or talking with friends. But 
neither will set us free.<p> 

Perhaps an easier way to explain this complex theological fact is with 
a simple story.<p>  

A man, troubled by his failings, confessed his sins to a Catholic 
priest, and received Sacramental absolution. Later, he spent time in 
prayer with God, and brought up the subject of his already-confessed 
sins.<p>  

The answer from God -- who, although all-knowing, may have been trying 
to make a point -- was, "I don't remember."<p> 

And, this gentle reminder was enough to give the penitent the feeling 
of elation that comes with true freedom. <p> 

I've felt that feeling too, as I've left a confessional. <p>

As Jesus told the Apostles: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." 
(John 20:23) <p>

About six years ago, after I converted from being an atheist and a 
lapsed Catholic, I spent some time with a college friend who was not a 
believer.<p> 

She was quick to say that I seemed much happier since re-embracing the 
faith. But, she also said that she could never go back to being a 
Catholic because she couldn't stand living with "all that guilt." <p>

"Do I seem guilt-ridden?" I asked her. <p>

"No," she said.<p> 

"That's because the whole point is that Jesus died for our sins, in 
place of us. So, we get off scot-free. No guilt. All I have to do is 
try to live as He wants, and when I fail, I go to Confession, ask for 
His forgiveness, and I leave with a clean slate," I said.<p> 

"A clean slate..." she said, thoughtfully. "That sounds kinda nice." <p>

<title>Pope John Paul II Come to America -- Howley</title>

<h2>Pope John Paul II Comes to America </h2><p>
By<br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

The arrival of Pope John Paul II makes me think, with a chuckle, about 
the last time his plane, nicknamed "Shepherd One," touched down on 
American soil. <p>

It was at Stapleton International Airport, in Denver, for the 
celebration of the 1993 World Youth Day. Then, as now, President Bill 
Clinton waited to greet the pontiff, arriving via Air Force One less 
than an hour before the pope. <p>

I was in the area reserved for the pack of journalists covering the 
event. As we waited for the arrival of the pope's plane, I discussed 
the story with a reporter from a Boston television station.  <p>

She told me, in a confidential tone, "He's not going to discuss 
abortion. I have it from a very good source."  <p>

I knew her source. No need to even say it. It was our own Raymond 
Flynn, hizzhonor, "Raybo," the former mayor of Boston. Despite his 
assignment to Rome, as the Clinton-appointed U.S. ambassador to the 
Vatican, Flynn and his staff still kept up connections with the Boston 
press corps. <p>

Boston journalists fondly refer to the former mayor as "Raybo," 
referring to the time, while mayor, when he ran -- Rambo-like -- into 
a burning building and carried out an elderly woman. The joke at the 
time was: Boston politicians will do anything to ensure another vote. <p>

Most Boston journalists tended to like the mayor, then and now, 
because he had all the trappings of a Irish Catholic politicians, with 
none of the baggage. Meaning, he used his religion to wring every last 
vote out of the predominantly Catholic populace, in true James Michael 
Curley fashion, but, he didn't support Church teaching with his vote, 
in true Kennedy fashion. <p>

Hizzhonor claimed to be personally opposed to abortion, yet he did 
everything in his power to elect our pro-abortion President Bill 
Clinton, who couldn't have won the White House without the Catholic 
vote. Flynn criss-crossed the country for months before the election, 
tirelessly campaigning for Clinton. <p>

And, in his own backyard, Flynn did nothing -- zero -- during his 
lengthy tenure as Boston's mayor to stop the hundreds of abortions 
going on in Boston City Hospital, which was under his control.  <p>

I shook my head, doubtfully.  <p>

"Naw, I think he's going to mention abortion," I said. "I think Raybo 
may be engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, on that one." <p>

My fellow journalist was confident.  <p>

"Nope. It's not going to come up, at least in public. I'd bet my last 
dollar on that," she said. <p>

Well, you know the outcome. It took the Holy Father all of three 
minutes to bring up the subject. In his arrival speech, on the airport 
tarmac, he exhorted Americans to "Defend life!"  <p>

Flynn, who on that occasion was holding the umbrella to shield Bill 
Clinton from the rain, looked more and more downcast, as the speech 
wore on. <p>

"All the great causes that are yours today will have meaning only to 
the extent that you guarantee the right to life and protect the human 
person," the Holy Father said, emphatically. <p>

At the time, I actually felt a bit sorry for our ambassador to the 
Vatican, as he stood in the rain with a dejected look on his face. It 
seems he tried to work some behind-the-scene angle that didn't, in the 
end, prove to be fruitful. <p>

You'd think the American media would be used to it by now, and expect 
John Paul to speak strongly about the issues that threaten modern 
society. After all, the Holy Father has often used his speeches to 
label abortion as "murder." <p>

Shocking, isn't it? In the stultifying atmosphere of today's American 
culture, everyone is supposed to toe the line. Even the Conservatives 
aren't willing to take a risk by accurately describing what happens 
during an abortion, or by verbalizing the forces that lie at the root 
of our anti-life society. <p>

Those who try to defend the modern status quo have worked to convince 
Americans that "words kill" -- particularly when referring to 
abortion. Of course, America is built on the premise that only free 
and robust debate will ensure our liberty. But, in large part, the 
other side has convinced most citizens that speaking too strongly on 
any issue is somehow a danger to us all. <p>

Ironically, the opposite is true. In truth, silence kills. 
Historically, we've seen what happens, again and again, when good 
people stay quiet.  <p>

We can all take a lesson from the Holy Father, who during all of his 
previous 67 trips outside the Vatican has never hesitated to speak the 
truth, with love. <p>

He doesn't flinch when condemning such things as chemical 
contraception, sterilization, en-vitro fertilization, feminist 
extremism, and sex outside of marriage, to name but a few hot button 
issues.  <p>

When was the last time an American leader had the guts to lay it on 
the line, like that? <p>

<h2>Giving Up Too Early</h2> 
<i>December 31, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

"I give up, its over."  In today's fly by night world, that's all it takes to destroy one of the most important institutions in society, Marriage.
<P>
Isn't it time to repeal so-called "no fault divorce" laws that allow people to simply shed their marital commitment like a pair of dirty socks.  Over the past thirty years, no-fault divorce laws have been destroying marriage as an institution of life-long commitment.  Much like the debate over "same-sex" marriages, this is a debate over the definition of marriage.  Are we going to let marriage become simply a way of getting better health-care benefits and cheaper car insurance or are we going to elevate it as one of the most important institutions in our society.
<P>
This spring, Florida State Representative Steve Wise of Jacksonville will be introducing legislation to repeal Florida's twenty-five year old "no-fault divorce" law.  It will be a real battle as the liberal groups will try to scare the legislators into thinking the bill would legalize spouse-abuse or something.  On the contrary, it will stop the child abuse that results from a broken marriage.
<P>
When a man and a woman make a commitment to marriage, it is a commitment for life.   Adults get all the opportunities they want to date or meet different people but when two people decide to get married, they must understand what a significant and permanent step they are taking.  It is true that half of all marriages end in divorce, but this should not condemn us all.  Most people get married and stick it out through thick and thin.  The high rate of divorce results in large part because the same people are getting into multiple marriages and then ducking out several times.
<P>
A Florida women I talked with had four husbands since she was twenty and was now divorcing the fifth.   There were valid reasons for a couple of the break-ups but at least two of the marriages ended because they simple thought married like was too difficult.  The tragedy of this is that three children from three husbands were born.  She told me that all she had to do for the latest divorce was sign a simple form in one of those divorce chapels which work a lot like their counterparts in Las Vegas.
<P>
It is about time that we eliminate the term "irreconcilable differences" from divorce law.  All it really means is that the adults in question aren't mature enough to work it out.   Repealing the "no-fault" laws would mean that the person wanting the divorce would have to show cause such as desertion, abuse or infidelity.
<P>
Children are the biggest losers because of "no-fault" divorce.  1 out of 4 children live in a single parent home and a lot of these children could be saved by not letting there parents split up simply because they can't be bothered to go to counseling and work it out.  Anyone who's married will tell you that its not always a piece of cake.  You can't act like a selfish teenager anymore because you have to make sacrifices for the good of your new family.
<P>
We need to stop encouraging this trial-and-error attitude toward marriage and go back to where, as Bob Dole put it, "Your word is your bond."

<h2>The Presidency is Ill</h2> 
<i>December 30, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

As a child, I remember being caught with my hands in the cookie jar.  Most of us do.  The President on the other hand never learned his lesson and has been found, along with his associates, hiding in the Mrs. Fields cookie factory, and as a result is bringing down the Presidency and the whole country.
<P>
The President's damage control team has tried to dismiss any comparison between the President's indiscretions and those during the Watergate scandal.   I have to agree that there is little similarity between the two and this needs to be made clear. Clinton's transgressions are worse.  Another excuse that is commonly heard from the administration is "its just politics, and everyone does it."  All one must do is list the number of scandals such as troopergate, Whitewater, filegate, and lippogate, to realize that this administration has been in the cookie jar far more often than the last forty years of presidents. No other President has broken his word and abused the trust of the people more that the current President.
<P>
It is beyond my comprehension that our President has continually put himself in circumstances that ethical people would know to steer clear of.   People sometimes get caught up in a bad situation that they later regret, but no one can excuse the repeated indiscretions on the part of the administration. Claiming that it was a "bureaucratic SNAFU" once,will work, but a dozen of them is hard to accept.
<P>
If I were to try to come up with a list of illegal activities that a sitting president could do, I would be hard pressed to come up with a longer list than that of the current occupant of the White House.  Clinton has surrounded himself with selfish political operatives like himself  instead of competent people interested in the country rather than the next election cycle.  The American people are growing tired of politicians serving their own interests.  Being President of the United States should be an honor, and should be treated as such.  To often, politicians who have won election think they have been given a blank check that doesn't have to be cashed until the next election. The government derives its power from the governed and our trusted elected servants need to remember that.
<P>
All to often, politicians win merely because of a spending advantage or better campaign staffs, and then make the mistake that the American people understood their entire campaign platform and agree with its entire contents.  This was evident in 1992 and 1996.  In 1992, no one knew what Clinton was about, but they knew he was anything but George Bush.  Likewise, in 1996, Clinton had no agenda other than he would be less severe than the Republicans.  The President won the election, but he must remember that he will have to give the White House up in four years.  Will he leave the presidency in better or worse shape.  The trend is becoming obvious.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public stop allowing our elected officials on both sides of the aisle to disparage our great nation.  Shouldn't we hold our elected officials up to a higher standard than we may hold ourselves or our neighbors. How we ever got to the point where we have accepted that our President is not in the least bit ethical, I don't know.
<P>
The sickness in the White House is spreading, and unfortunately, it is beginning to affect the very honor of the Presidency.  The White House is up for sale and the Lincoln bedroom is for rent to the highest bidder.  And the owner is a guy named "Bubba."

<h2>Parents Get Side-Stepped Again</h2> 
<i>December 24, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

Last week Jack Valente, the incredibly annoying and self-important president of the Motion Picture Association announced they he and the rest of the newly formed Television Council had finally reached agreement on a standard rating system for TV shows.  I give it a rating of "G" for garbage.
<P>
I was not overly excited when Congress and the President forced TV manufacturers to install V-Chips in all new TVs.  I feel that besides being an example of regulating us to death, It was also going to give parents a good excuse to leave their kids in front of the television and ignore their parental responsibilities.
<p>
But if the V-Chip is going to become a reality then it might as well be useful.  The garbage that the commission calls a rating system will do nothing for parents of children in all age ranges.  The primary problem is that the ratings are incredibly vague and dont even cover news programs which I find often have the most violence and mature themes that we are trying to protect our children from.
<p>
Rather than make my point using shows like ABCs NYPD which  we all regard as inappropriate for children, the focus should be on the middle of the road shows, and some shows which are supposedly family shows.  Because many shows will not be bad enough to warrant the most severe rating nor will they be timid enough to receive the "G" rating, a giant mushy middle will be left that will contain an incredibly large range of show content.
<p>
A good example of this problem is evident in the ABC Friday lineup of "family" shows.  ABC bills their Friday lineup as all family shows but quite often the theme becomes quite mature.  Issues such as dating, racism, religion and sex are common even in the family programs. Parents can not be sure that their favorite family show wont end up showing a young boy and girl in a compromising situation. By then it is too late for the parent to intervene, and the parent must try to explain what happened.
<p>
The problem with the proposed system is that because of its vagueness, parents will not have any idea why a program received the rating it did.  It is because of this, that the rating system will be of little use to parents.  There is really no line that television wont cross.  ABC even has a show about a teenage witch who often casts spells over her enemies.  As if  parents didnt have enough working against them, news programs will be exempt from the ratings.  The thought that the evening news and even the tabloid shows like Hard Copy will not even be rated is quite ridiculous.
<p>
The television executives will tell me that I am a prude, and that a little kissing and  or witchcraft is okay for our children but I disagree and in the end, isnt it the parents final decision what their children watch.  I plan to discuss sex and other mature issues when I feel it is appropriate, not when ABC, NBC, and CBS think so.
<p>
The new ratings system is just another case of the fox guarding the hen house. Groups like the Family Research Council and the Parents Television Council are pushing for giving parents more information to make there decisions.  Hopefully parents will get eventually get there due.
<p>
Until then, be careful.  You never know what is coming on the television next.


<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h2>Democrats, Don't Kid Yourselves</h2> 
<i>December 23, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Democrats are celebrating this week because they believe that by getting the Speaker of the House to admit to a few improprieties, they are providing cover for their own problems with the illegal fundraising practices of the White House and the Democratic National Committee.  In a few months they will wake up with a hangover realizing that they were wrong.
<p>
For almost four years now, the truth about Whitewater has been slow getting out.  Republicans for the longest time, felt that this was their silver arrow that would bring down the president.  As we now know, it didnt, in large part because it is too complex for most of the American public to care about, let alone understand.  The Democrats should understand that the complex tax laws that the Speaker is accused of admitted to bending, have the same qualities that stop the average American from caring.
<p>
It is my opinion that the American people are not so much concerned about whether every last tax regulation was complied with, but rather whether our political process is being corrupted. The Speaker is only accused of being too partisan when he was not supposed to, and hiring a poor lawyer whom he didnt supervise enough. On the other hand, it is quickly becoming obvious that the DNC and the White House have systematically sold access to the Administration and political appointments to the highest bidder.  Only the prestige of the Presidency is saving Mr. Clinton.  If these revelations were coming out about a mayor or a city councilman, we would surely have heard the word "bribe" by now.  The big question concerning the political system is . . . . . . .   shouldnt campaign/legal defense fund donations which are rewarded with ambassadorship, committee appointments, and policy positions be called what they are, Bribes?
<p>
In this great democracy, we (the average American) believe that the government derives it power from us, and that we all have a theoretical part ownership in its institution.  I for one, do not appreciate my 1/275,000,000  share of the Lincoln bedroom being rented out to drug pushers, arms dealers, a foreign businessmen trying to alter American policy.
<p>
The president has tried to cover-up his troubles by clinging onto the Campaign Finance Reform bandwagon.  What he doesnt realize, it that we would be happy if he would just follow the laws that are on the books currently.
<p>
The current push for campaign finance reform is as misguided as the push just after the Nixon resignation.  The current system limits the amount of influence that the average American can have, giving all the power to wealthy Americans, corporations, and lobbyists.  That is as much as the liberals and I agree on.  The proper solution is not to limit spending more but to allow individuals to contribute more.   The fact that it costs a lot of money to run a house or senate race is not a problem.  This country is big and limiting spending will only limit the amount of information that is disseminated to average voters.  This would have the result of giving all the power to the inside the Beltway lobbyists.
<P>
If only there were stronger penalties for breaking the laws on the books, then maybe campaign laws would be taken seriously. Otherwise, the politicians will continue to recognize that it is easier to get elected and just pay the fine later.
<p>
Exploiting  the Gingrich story will not be enough to disguise the stench coming from the 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  Trie, Huang, and all the rest of the fundraising dropouts are coming home to add to the smell.   
<P>
Anybody got a can of Lysol?

God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h2>English Out, Ebonics In</h2> 
<i>December 20, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

It has finally happened.  We have given up trying to educate our youth.  I don't see how we can expect to teach our children physics, or calculus if we can't be bothered to teach them proper English.
<p>
This week, the Oakland school board unanimously voted to recognize "black English" as a second language equal to that of Spanish or Chinese. "Ebonics," a term derived by combining the terms Ebony and Phonics, allows sentences with double negative such as "I'm not going back there no more." and with absences of the verb "to be" such as "she be at the store." Ebonics is heard on the streets and in many rap artist's songs.
<p>
In addition to this, the school district is likely to apply for federal money to pay for this bilingual education.  It's bad enough to recognize that sometimes youth create slang words like "awesome" or "cool", but to spend money encouraging it, is societal suicide.
<p>
Many blacks find this "give-up" attitude in education extremely patronizing. Steve Gooden, a black who attended the Republican convention in  San Diego said, "This cuts to the heart of the issue, --defining us as genetically deprived."  Many people worry that this might be an excuse to lower the education standards for the black community including Delain Eastin, the state education superintendent.
<p>
English is an incredibly complicated language, but it is necessary to make to effort to educate our youth, especially those from disadvantaged areas, in what the proper use of English is.  No one speaking in sentences with double and triple negatives is going to get chosen for a high paying career job. 
<p>
We have to expect more from our children, as they will only achieve what we ask of them.   We would not accept our children thinking two plus two equaled seven and we should not accept slang as proper speech.
<p>
As long as there a people on this earth, we are going to have different languages and dialects but we can hold to a single standard that can survive changes in the immediate culture.  It should not surprise us though.  Our society loves to soften rules.  Religious people of all faiths used to view their faith as the one true absolute and now you often hear people saying "I like that part of Christianity and that part of Buddhism or Judaism."
<p>
At a time when over fifty percent of high school seniors have tries an illicit drug such as marijuana, LSD, and cocaine,  and the global marketplace is putting increased emphasis on education, we should not be accepting street language as another national language.

<h2>Christmas Spirit?</h2> 
<i>December 19, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Many people across the nation think that our country is in a moral crisis and from the type of the news stories each evening describing murders, rapes, and adultery, I can't argue. For the next couple of weeks, though the Christmas season will fill most Americans will feelings of joy and hope. Hopefully it will remind people of our true calling in life: to be servants of our LORD.  Don't count on it.<p>

Last night, as I sat down to watch the news, I came across a shining example of the shallowness of the Christmas spirit. NBC had their annual Christmas special attended by dozens of celebrities, elected officials, cabinet secretaries, and the President and the First Lady, many of which have exposed their contempt for religious conservatives. 

<p>

Hosted by those ridiculous aliens from NBC's <i>Third Rock from the Sun</i>, it was one of the most overt commercial exploitation's of Christ that I have seen.  It made me really think what people really consider the definition of the "Christmas Spirit" to be.  The most common phrase uttered during to show was "season of peace and joy". Granted peace and joy is great, but Christmas is not the celebration of our ourselves. It is a celebration of the birth of Christ, our Savior.
<p>
Now, don't misunderstand me. I am not calling into question anyone's faith, but I do question why so quickly after Christmas, people forget what most of their favorite Christmas carols are about; the birth of Christ.
<p>
Ever since people of faith began to participate in large numbers in the political system, they have been under attack by the liberal establishment.  I've grown tired of hearing the term "religious-far-right-extreme conservative" used to describe every normal American who bothers to vote and happens to lead a life of faith in GOD.
<p>
The true spirit of Christmas should not end on January 2nd, when all the celebrating is over.  We must carry it over into our daily lives. Hymns and carols about Christ don't have to disappear after Christmas. We need to continue to be charitable to those less fortunate. And we need to remember the greatest gift we've ever received; the Savior from GOD.
<p>
Santa can't hold a candle to that.
<p>
Christmas is the celebration of a new life, and yet shortly after Christmas, I am sure we will hear more anti-religious bigotry from the left.  It won't be long before the issue of protecting unborn children will be before Congress, and I hope that the people we invest our trust and democracy to, will think back to this Christmas and the shape our nation is in and do the right thing. Protect another beautiful life.
<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<title>Rockwell: The Farm Trick Reform -- 04/17/96

<h2> The Farm Trick Reform
</h2>



Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Hillary Clinton should have called her medical bill "Freedom 
To Heal." Then Congress might have passed it as restoring the 
free market in medicine. If you don't believe such a trick would 
have worked, take a look at the "Freedom To Farm" bill now 
sailing into law. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Official propaganda says this bill restores a free market in 
agriculture, ending 60 years of subsidies and planning. But ask 
yourself: if this were really true, wouldn't farmers on the dole, 
and the media, be in hysterics? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, and a close examination of the bill backs up this 
suspicion. The existing scheme, based on New Deal programs in 
turn modeled on the old Russian system, is retained in all its 
essentials. After this bill expires in seven years, the 1949 law 
that presently oppresses us will again be the law of the land. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not that the new bill is salt peanuts. With a $47 billion 
price tag, it allocates even more money to subsidies initially, 
and to crazy new liberal programs. But in seven years, we're 
told, price supports and subsidies will be "phased out." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This farm bill is typical of a Congress that can't bring 
itself to cut a dime of federal spending, yet passes reams of 
"revolutionary" laws promising to cut, slash, abolish, and 
otherwise establish a libertarian Heaven on Earth...sometime in 
the next millennium. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But in the here and now, the bill retains price supports for 
peanuts and sugar, as well as price-fixing for milk. It renews a 
program locking up 36 million acres. And it throws away $1.4 
billion on more regulations, $200 million on a Florida swamp, and 
$300 million on "rural development." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All in all, this bill could have been written by Bill 
Clinton, which is why he's glad to sign it. The Democrats 
particularly like the food stamp and school lunch provisions. 
Why, you may ask, are these part of a farm bill? Because those
who benefit, along with the "poor," are wealthy agribusinessmen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why this bill? Why now? Crop prices are at a ten-year high, 
and under the current subsidy formula, payments would be low. So, 
by merest happenstance, this bill changes the price-based system 
into a flat subsidy. Three to four billion dollars more will be 
spent for farm welfare immediately. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bill's supporters say it eliminates many set asides, 
acreage controls, and crop mandates. But that would only be a 
glorious thing if the industry weren't subsidized and protected 
from competition. "Freedom to farm"--with other people's money.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The farm program is one of the oldest federal scandals. The troubles
began a century and half ago, when U.S. tariffs were set 
to favor industry at the expense of agriculture. The policy 
culminated in an invasion of the agricultural South by former 
industrial lobbyist Abe Lincoln. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Then, in the first world war, the federal government pumped 
up the price of wheat and other products, and after the war, 
tried to keep them that way. That effort failed, and after two 
devastating post-war downturns, officials sought more 
protectionism and outright planning. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By the time of the Great Depression, the Jeffersonian ideal 
of the independent yeoman farmer was banished. As president, 
Herbert Hoover set out to keep prices high by subsidies, trade 
restrictions, and planting controls at the very time when market 
pressures were forcing them to fall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But Mr. Hoover was small potatoes compared to farm dictator 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. As he forced farmers to slaughter their 
hogs and plow under their crops in order to raise prices, he was 
also flooding some of the world's best farm land for the 
Tennessee Valley Authority. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The "brain trust" that gave us those policies still runs 
agriculture. The sector has become a virtual ward of the state, 
with the feds holding more than half of all farm debt. There are 
still independent farmers, and they avoid Washington like the 
boll weevil. Agriculture is dominated by subsidized agribusiness, 
its lobbyists, and its pet politicians. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The victims of food socialism are consumers and taxpayers, 
who shell out billions directly and in the form of artificially 
high prices every year. Also harmed are the remaining independent 
farmers, whose livelihoods are threatened by subsidized 
competition. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's why Congress should pass a real Freedom To Farm Act. 
It would abolish the whole of the existing system, and subject 
the sector to the same competition and price dictates that free 
industries face. Congress should also stop concocting tricky new 
ways to prop up big government with misnamed bills.

<title>Rockwell: Ending the Fed's Free Ride -- 04/09/96
</title>

<h2> Ending the Fed's Free Ride
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>


Today's civics test: what Washington institution can make or  
break elections, bail out entire foreign governments, send the  
stock market to the stratosphere, or bankrupt whole industries,  
yet operates with less oversight than even the CIA?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One hint: the U.S. Constitution is useless as a cheat sheet  
(as it would be for any realistic civics exam these days.) The 
answer is the Federal Reserve, the most powerful yet least  
questioned any D.C. bureaucracy. Will that soon change?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


At issue is a new report on the Fed, released by Government  
Accounting Office just as Alan Greenspan seeks Senate  
confirmation for his third term. The report pulled back the  
curtain, just a smidgen, on the Fed's notorious secrecy. Now some  
Senators and pressure groups are gearing up to give the Fed the  
what-for.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Among other revelations in the report is the Fed's  
heretofore secret "contingency fund"--that is, slush  
fund--totaling $3.7 billion. It comes from money that the Fed has  
skimmed off the revenues gained from its open-market operations.  
Everyone thought revenues were turned over to the Treasury.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


And that's far from the only slush sluicing through the  
halls of the Fed's marble temple on Constitution Ave. From 1988  
to 1994, the Fed's spending on its own lifestyle grew at twice  
the rate of inflation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Mr. Greenspan protests the suggestion that the Fed is  
wasting taxpayer dollars. He's technically right. The Fed doesn't  
need our taxes any more than a counterfeiter needs to hold up the  
local gas station. The central bank using fancy finance to  
effectively print all the money it needs.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In its never-ending quest to expand money and credit, the  
Fed can lower the rate it charges member banks for loans, it can  
manipulate reserve requirements, or, most notoriously, it can buy  
Treasury securities on the open market.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's this last action that proves so profitable. The Fed  
purchases Treasury securities--either directly or through  
favorite brokerage houses--and holds this debt as an asset.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Working through its branches and member banks, it pyramids  
loans on top of these securities. The creditworthiness of the  
U.S. government--whose balance sheet would otherwise suggest  
Chapter 7--is entirely due to this power of the Fed.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The real oddity--and this is where the power to counterfeit  
comes in--is where the Fed gets the money to purchase these debt  
securities. It creates it out of thin air, a magic trick made  
easier as the current paper money system replaced the restrictive gold 
standard.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If anyone tries this at home, the Justice Department lands  
him in the pokey. When third-world countries are rumored to be  
circulating phony dollars, the military threatens to bomb them.  
To stop counterfeiting is why the Treasury says it redesigned the  
$100 bill. It could also be cracking down on the competition.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Now to the Fed's just-discovered $3.7 billion slush fund. It  
represents a small slice of the profits the Fed derives from  
exacting interest payments on the debt it holds. And who pays  
that interest? You and me, in the form of tax dollars. At the end  
of the year, the Fed gives some back and keeps the rest.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The original argument for creating the Fed is that it would  
eliminate banking crises that cause bank depositors to lose their  
money. Well, after 1913, the recessions increased in frequency,  
the government became vastly bigger, and the dollar lost about 97  
percent of its value. In one way or another, depositors have lost  
more money than ever.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Fed's fingerprints are all over these trends. Every new  
dollar created by the Fed's operations (all else being equal)  
waters down the value of the existing dollars circulating in the  
economy. And an ever-cheaper dollar redistributes money from  
savers to debtors, and from the tax-paying middle class to the  
banks and government contractors that spend the fresh money  
before prices rise.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


We hear that inflation is low, but look at the long-term  
trends. The dollar has lost three quarters of its value since  
Richard Nixon eliminated the last vestiges of the gold standard 
in 1971. Even at the present rate of inflation--and who believes  
that will last?--overall prices will have doubled when today's  
newborns enter the workforce.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If we want to know why living standards are falling, the  
curtain needs to be pulled back even more. If we want to stop the  
fall, we need a truly redesigned money: a Fed-proof gold dollar.

<h2> The Standard Bearer Returns
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Taxpayers, it's no time to despair. The anti-government   
revolt that swept the Democrats out of power in Congress is still   
on. But in the newest twist, the revolt has exposed the   
Republican establishment's own compromises with government power.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The evidence comes from a dramatic political contest in the  
14th district of Texas. Former Congressman and intellectual  
firebrand Ron Paul won the Republican runoff for the House seat  
currently held by party switcher Greg Laughlin. The results have  
sent shock waves through Republican ruling circles.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a Democrat only yesterday, Mr. Laughlin had money,  
media access, the endorsement of the Republican elite, and the  
use of the party's biggest guns. Dr. Paul, in contrast, was the  
outsider who gained a stunning 9-point victory by stressing his  
independence, ideals, and pristine record.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In Washington, the race became a loyalty test. The House  
leadership prevailed upon 53 high-ranking Congressmen to send  
contributions to the Laughlin campaign. The party dispatched its  
own ample funds, along with Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the two  
George Bushes, and even Reagan-era leftover Ed Meese.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But bigshots couldn't muscle the voters in this largely   
rural district. The endorsements only confirmed Dr. Paul's claim   
not to be part of any machine. In fact, Phil Gramm's ads for the   
Laughlin campaign had to be pulled when they began to backfire.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The Laughlin strategy assumed, without evidence, that voters   
trust the Republican leadership to tell them how to vote. But the   
bloom was already off that rose. Republicans have run Congress   
for more than a year, and taxes are still high, spending is   
higher, living standards continue to fall, and our liberties are   
just as imperiled.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When Mr. Laughlin switched from the Democrat Party, the   
Republican leadership put him on the Ways and Means Committee,  
the best seat in the House for buying and selling special favors.   
But an insider deal couldn't erase Mr. Laughlin's voting record,   
which was Clintonesque to the core. His switch was not   
ideological, of course, but political. Throw in the  Roll Call    
scoop that he is Washington's number one junket taker, and he   
became the personification of double-dealing politics.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

  
The party claimed to support Mr. Laughlin because it wanted   
to show that converts can win elections. But that doesn't explain   
the timing. The switch occurred only after Dr. Paul told the   
House leadership of his intention to run. The deeper truth is   
that the leadership wanted to keep Dr. Paul and his   
uncompromising approach at bay.     
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul's voting record is a portrait of courage and of   
unshakable devotion to liberty. He worked against taxes,   
spending, foreign wars, and pork-barrel projects, even in his own   
district. In the ratings of the National Taxpayers Union, he   
holds the all-time highest score.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
When he was in Congress before, Dr. Paul never hesitated to   
buck the party leadership and vote against its hidden tax   
increases and unbalanced budgets. He tossed special interest   
groups out of his office. And he resisted personal pressure from   
Ronald Reagan to vote for IMF subsidies and military pork.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul was the first politician in this century to   
introduce term-limits legislation, not just for politicians, but   
also for federal judges and bureaucrats. He was the first to call   
for the abolition of Congressional pensions, and refused to take   
part in that giveaway. He was the first to call for the BATF to   
be abolished. And thanks to his efforts on behalf of the gold   
standard, the U.S. now mints the best-looking gold coins in the   
world.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
He is an eloquent spokesman for states rights and individual   
liberties against federal intrusion, for sound money against   
inflation and other Fed manipulations, and for self government   
against centralized power. His foreign policy views are those of   
George Washington: trade with all and belligerence toward none.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul combines his idealistic political philosophy with   
an impressive technical knowledge of economics. He is an exponent   
of the Austrian School, and knows more about such subjects as   
business cycles and central banking than most working economists   
and any sitting member of Congress.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a physician who has brought more than 4,000 babies into   
the world, he also knows that the biggest enemy the family has is   
our declining economy, thanks to excessive taxes and regulations.   
He knows that the government is also to blame for our failing   
educational system.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In his fight, Dr. Paul forged a coalition that included the   
religious right, economic libertarians, home schoolers, gun   
owners, land owners, businessmen, and anti-war isolationists.   
That is, people who want to be left alone by the government.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ron Paul faces another hurdle in the general election. But   
if he makes it, he will once again be big government's biggest   
enemy in Washington. No wonder Republican power elites,   
especially those whose actions belie their rhetoric, are worried.

<title>Rockwell: "Public Sector" Racket -- 04/21/96

<h2>"Public Sector" Racket 
</h2>
Llewellyn Rockwell
<P>


The term "public sector" is highly misleading. It's supposed  
to refer to the government, that well-known public servant, in  
contrast to the "private sector," the greedy and selfish market.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But the opposite is the case. In the "private sector," all  
activity is focussed on serving the public, people helping people  
get quality goods and services at the best price. A business that  
loses sight of its consumers is quickly outcompeted by one that  
serves the public better. The market is the true public sector.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On the other hand, government is obsessively focussed on  
itself and its private, internal, bureaucratic interests. It  
doesn't engage in productive enterprise, there are no regular  
consumers of its "services," it is owned by no one in particular,  
and it doesn't worry about profit and loss.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government's primary if not exclusive function is to  
redistribute wealth from one group to another by force. The  
people, the very ones involuntarily funding the government, are  
seen as chumps and menaces, and used as pawns in social  
experiments and power grabs. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this comes clear when you compare the way any private  
company works with, say, the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development. In the most recent outrage, HUD decided it should  
blow up its housing projects in downtown Baltimore and move the  
residents to pricey homes in the suburbs, at fantastic taxpayer  
expense. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This demented scheme--which will drive down property values,  
increase crime, and unsettle whole communities--is at war with  
the public interest. That's why it's generated an explosion of  
resistance among homeowners in the Baltimore area. Especially  
peeved are new suburbanites, who worked hard to get away from the  
inner city.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just who benefits from this scheme? Power-mad bureaucrats  
who see their mandate as tearing up the social pea patch, and the  
contractors and social workers who live off the ensuing  
destruction. These are private, not public, interests.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market, in contrast, is the peaceful and fully  
accountable public servant. Capitalists produce houses and  
apartments for every social group. If we were sticklers in our 
use of language, we would call what the market achieves "public  
housing," since its purpose is not to destroy, but to create  
housing options for everyone at the least possible expense.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Here's another example. Which is more anxious to serve the  
public: the government's mail operation, or the myriad of private  
delivery services? You don't have to be an expert to know. UPS 
and Fedex men toil with packages piled high, racing from place to  
place, competing to provide ever better service.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. Postal Service is so bad that it changed its name  
(it used to be Post Office) and logo (from a mailbox to an  
eagle's head) to avoid ridicule. The service gets worse (I'm old  
enough to remember twice-daily delivery), the price always goes  
up (especially on business), and the whining never stops. Can we 
imagine Fedex employees complaining about too much business, as  
the postal people do during the Christmas season?   
  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No, public service is not the Postal Service's strength. But  
it has mastered the art of lobbying. That's why, despite the  
blather about being "revolutionary," this Congress hasn't even  
considered repealing the unamerican laws that prohibit  
first-class mail competition.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like all government bureaucracies, the Postal Service has no  
real owners, and most of its "customers" have no choice. The  
offices are so unpleasant that one of last year's best performing  
stocks was a company that takes your letters and packages to the  
P.O. so you don't have to.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

So the Postal Service blows millions on ads designed to  
bamboozle. One new campaign claims it's "a very businesslike  
business." Why? Because it's so big, the 33rd largest "company"  
in the world, having moved up a notch after the Politburo was  
downsized.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the government claims that its private interests  
are really the public interest, it is busy destroying private  
industries that truly do serve the public. If the Justice  
Department brings suit against a business for "discriminating"  
against some privileged group, for example, it's as good as dead.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Worse, Congress has called on the nation's tax-collecting  
public servants to share their jobs with non-government lawyers,  
so they can scarf up more private revenue. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thanks to this perverse "privatization," a private-sector  
profession will be paid by a public-sector agency to loot private  
property for the private interests of phony public servants. Oh,  
for those simpler, better days before government ruined our  
language.

<title>Rockwell: China: Trade Yes, Aid No  -- 4/22/96
</title>

<h2> China: Trade Yes, Aid No 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.</a>
<p>
What's so difficult about China? The political class seems  
intent on reviving the Cold War, but every issue before us can be  
solved by a quick reflection on the basic principles of classical  
liberalism, which happen to coincide with America's traditions as  
well as common sense. The rule with China, as with every other  
country, should be this simple: trade, not aid.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trouble with Most Favored Nation status is that it  
conflates the two categories. It gives the recipient access to  
our markets and ours to theirs, with low tariffs both ways, which  
is as it should be. However, it also makes MFN governments  
eligible for grants, loans, and guarantees from the World Bank  
and the International Monetary Fund. Those are indirectly and  
primarily funded by U.S. taxpayers.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Have these grants and loans ever done any good in the long  
run? There's not a single case. Rich countries have gotten along  
without them just fine. Poor countries get strapped with debt,  
and have to accept the policy terms of the lending agencies. More  
often than not, that means Keynesian-style fiscal policy, heavy  
regulation, laborious labor laws, and tax increases. That is not  
a recipe for prosperity.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So by all means, end aid from these agencies to China, and 
everywhere else. At the same time, there is no good reason to  
impose trade sanctions. They merely restrict the rights of  
American consumers and producers to buy and sell in the most  
favorable places. If that's France and Germany, fine. If it's  
China and Cuba, that's fine too. With the Cold War over, it's  
time to separate economic policy and foreign policy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That the political class is suddenly ganging up on China is  
particularly ironic. Here's a communist government that has  
liberalized its economy to a striking degree. More trade will  
push the process further, and might even ensure some measure of  
political liberalization as well.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet the litany of reasons why China should be considered a  
"rogue state" grows ever longer. Its government squelches civil  
liberties. It doesn't enforce U.S. property rights. It encourages  
abortion. It threatens its neighbors. Bad, bad, China.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But by those standards, the U.S. government looks pretty  
roguish too. Federal police agencies are no well-known respecters  
of human rights. As for property rights, they took quite a  
beating on April 15 this year. The U.S. government routinely  
engages in land seizures in the name swamp protection, and it  
promotes abortion with tax dollars.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Is this, to use Cold War language, the horrible practice of  
seeing a "moral equivalence" between U.S. democratic and foreign 
authoritarian ones? Not at all. As Americans, we have  
a moral obligation to concentrate on the beam in our eye, not the  
splinter in someone else's.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The biggest problem is hypocrisy. We not only trade with,  
but give massive aid to, governments around the world that  
mistreat their own people, kill innocents outside their borders,  
and refuse to recognize even rudimentary liberties. Why single  
out China?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China may tolerate the copying of films and compact discs.  
The question is: why should American consumers be denied access  
to goods from China because American exporters are unhappy with  
Chinese copyright laws? It is the business of U.S. exporters, not  
the U.S. government, to protect overseas profits.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All of this flows from a simple proposition, the very basis  
of the free enterprise system: economics is the business of  
business, not government. If the U.S. government has any role, it  
is to protect life, liberty, and property here at home. Forcing  
exports on others, punishing evildoers abroad, or centrally  
planning the world trading system only invites trouble.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But isn't China threatening Taiwan, and isn't that grounds  
to wage a trade war? We only started hearing about the grave  
threat to Taiwan a few weeks before the Taiwanese ruling party  
was up for reelection. The central point in its platform is that  
China is a grave threat. Is it? If holding war games off its own  
shores is a hostile act, what about U.S. war games with Japan and  
Korea off China? Indeed, on the threatening of small countries by  
big ones, Panama, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican  
Republic might have something to say.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But let's assume China is planning an invasion of Taiwan,  
highly improbable given the relative balance of military power.  
What then? As regrettable as that might be, the U.S. cannot  
guarantee every State Department-approved border in the world.  
Let Taiwan provide for its own security, as it has amply done. It  
is not up to Americans to be taxed, or die, for foreign regimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time the West tried to force its dominion and  
products on China, the issue was opium, and it led to vast  
unrest, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the eventual communist  
takeover. That brings us to another principle derived from the  
classical-liberal tradition: we cannot fully anticipate the bad  
consequences of government intervention, so we ought to prevent  
it where we can.

<title>Rockwell: Pat Buchanan's 'Old Right' Opposed Tariffs -- 4/24/96</title>

<h2>
Pat Buchanan's 'Old Right" Opposed Tariffs
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
 
What kind of conservative is Pat Buchanan? Supporters and  
opponents say that he's bringing back an older tradition, which  
rejects the cosmopolitanism of the National Review 
generation, and hearkens back to the "isolationism" and America  
First movement of the 30s and 40s.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Mr. Buchanan doesn't dispute this, and why should he? The  
Old Right, though widely misunderstood, was a principled band of  
intellectuals and activists, many of them libertarians, who  
fought the "industrial regimentation" of the New Deal, and were  
the first to note that, in America, statism and corporativism are  
inseparable.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, despite an otherwise appealing platform, Mr.  
Buchanan doesn't represent Old Right economic ideals. These  
writers ardently defended capitalism, including big business and  
corporations, celebrated the profit motive, and took a strict  
laissez-faire attitude toward international trade. They loathed  
tariffs, and saw protectionism as a species of socialist  
planning.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Frank Chodorov was a central intellectual figure on the  
Right from the 1920s to the 1950s, editing the early Freeman 
magazine and founding Human Events and the Intercollegiate  
Studies Institute. A prolific writer, Chodorov guided two  
generations of students and activists to the literature of  
liberty, and urged no compromise with the central state.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He proudly wore the label "isolationist" and, like Mr.  
Buchanan today, saw entry into the two world wars as a mistake  
because they bolstered militarism and big government in America.  
To Chodorov, isolationism was "not a political policy," but the  
proper and "natural attitude." People are rightly concerned with  
family and neighbors, he said, not foreign peoples and their  
troubles. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But, as he made clear, Chodorov's isolationism had nothing  
to do with international economics. Free trade with other nations  
is part of the normal working of the economy, which stems from  
being concerned with the well being of our families. Chodorov was  
aghast and angered when some people tried to make "America First"  
mean "Buy American": that is, "economic, rather than political,  
isolationism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Economic isolationism--tariffs, quotas, embargoes, and  
general governmental interference with international trade--is an  
irritant that can well lead to war," he wrote. "To build a trade  
wall around a country is to invite reprisals," and generates  
"misunderstanding and mistrust." To Chodorov, "Free trade is  
natural, protectionism is political."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

T. Flynn, the great journalist and leader of the  
America First Committee, agreed with Chodorov. "The last seventy  
years of American history," he wrote in 1944, "have been a struggle 
between the ideal of free enterprise and the determination to restrain 
and regiment it." Business "comprises the whole immense web of 
producing and distributing enterprises," but tragically, "some men, 
for various reasons, set out to interfere in the natural workings of 
this immense organism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn condemns domestic industrial planning because it leads  
to trade barriers. "The first condition of a planned economy is  
that it shall be a closed economy," he wrote. That's why  
socialists want "an impenetrable wall around" the nation,  
"keeping out everybody and every kind of goods and striving for a  
complete self-sufficiency. Of course, this is not practical  
anywhere."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a nationalist, Flynn understood the difference  
between caring about one's country first and trade restriction,  
which he saw as having a socialist and fascist pedigree. The link  
between protection and planning, he pointed out, was not disputed  
even on the left. To Stuart Chase, the New Dealer who coined the  
term, "national planning and economic nationalism must go  
together or not at all."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn's view, toughened with a right-wing anarchist edge,  
was also that of Albert Jay Nock, the social critic who inspired  
several generations with his biting attacks on collectivism,  
egalitarianism, and modernity. As a writer for Harper's, he  
helped make anti-statism the political center of pre-war American  
conservatism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He too was against entering any foreign war, and could thus  
be fairly described as an "isolationist." But protectionist? "We  
all now know pretty well," he wrote in 1935, "that the primary  
reason for a tariff is that it enables the exploitation of the  
domestic consumer by a process indistinguishable from sheer  
robbery."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"By putting a tariff against the importation, say, of wool,  
the State permits the domestic wool-producing interests to levy a  
tax upon consumers of wool to the amount of the excess in price  
over the price determined by supply and demand in a free  
competitive market. These interests give the consumer nothing in  
return for the tax; the State gives them as beneficiaries, the  
privilege of levying it, and they accordingly do so."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Felix Morley was more of a traditionalist. He won the hearts  
of conservatives by defecting as editor of the Washington  
Post and later becoming editor of Human Events, as well as  
the author of brilliant books on federalism and foreign policy. 
He was an America Firster, an isolationist, and a right-wing  
populist to boot.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But when it came to free enterprise, there was no  
compromise: it must not stop at the border. "Unrestricted  
competition is essential to economic freedom," he wrote. "Indeed,  
it can be said that competition is freedom, as distinct from  
the personal attribute of liberty." "It follows that in an  
advancing civilization the objective with regard to the market will 
always be the removal of restrictions to trade."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is why Morley doubted that businessmen would be the  
best defenders of the market. They too often seek to protect  
themselves from competition in the name of free enterprise. "Time  
and again," he wrote, "those who argued for competition have, in  
practice, leaned toward monopolistic operations. Advocates of the  
free market have worked openly and surreptitiously for high  
tariffs and other governmental favors." As an example, he cites  
the industrial protectionism of the 19th century that Mr.  
Buchanan now praises.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The preeminent economic theorist of the Old Right was Henry  
Hazlitt. Kicked out of The Nation because he opposed FDR's  
National Recovery Act, he was made editor of The American  
Mercury by H.L. Mencken. During the heyday of Keynesianism,  
Hazlitt thrilled the free-market right with his editorials in  
Newsweek. He was also second to none in his hatred of all  
forms of government intervention, including protectionism and  
economic nationalism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hazlitt's Economics In One Lesson, still in print after  
fifty years, devotes two chapters to the tissue of fallacies that  
is the case for protectionism and subsidized exports. As Hazlitt  
demonstrates, "The tariff--though it may increase wages above  
what they would have been in the protected industries--must on  
net balance, when all occupations are considered, reduce real  
wages." As a friend of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. von Hayek,  
however, Hazlitt might be considered one of "those damned  
Austrian economists" that Mr. Buchanan warns us against reading.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There were Old Rightists who worried about free  
international trade, but not on Buchananite grounds. Essayist  
Garet Garrett came to favor closed borders because he worried  
about the war potential of forcing foreign consumers to buy  
American products, another policy Mr. Buchanan favors. At the  
same time, big business never had a greater champion than  
Garrett. A biographer rightly called him "Profit's Prophet."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Whatever can be said of Mr. Buchanan's trade theories, they  
are not those of the Old Right. Their intellectual legacy is more  
likely British mercantilism, and that's one import we can do  
without.

<h2>
Hillary's Revenge
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

Hillary Clinton has won a victory in the Senate. The  
Senate's health care bill, which passed unanimously, is not as  
flashy and detailed as her failed legislation. But the central  
principle is the same: the government, one way or another, should  
guarantee health care to everyone.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recall that Mrs. Clinton found herself on the receiving end  
of a propaganda blitz. She was denounced as a Marxist who wanted  
to centrally plan the economy, destroy small business, and take  
away freedom of choice.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This was sweet music to lovers of free enterprise. Was the  
Republican Party, which in the past has backed big government  
medical reforms, at last making principled arguments? Corporate,  
medical, and insurance lobbies--also soft on government  
intervention--even joined in the attack.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People and publications not usually prone to criticize  
statism sounded like libertarian purists. Even the New Republic  
ran a detailed, point-by-point attack on the White House plan.  
Thanks to these efforts, we were spared a nightmarish plot to  
nationalize one-seventh of the economy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yet, ominously, several provisions--some of the most  
socialistic ones in the Clinton plan--escaped deep criticism. For  
example, insurance companies would be forbidden from refusing, or  
charging higher premiums for, customers who would drive them to  
bankruptcy. That is, insurers could not take account of  
"preexisting conditions," as the lingo has it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zoom forward one year. This provision ends up as the core of  
the Republican health care bill. If automotive or housing  
insurance couldn't "discriminate," costs would zoom and clients  
would have less of an incentive to care for their property. So  
too will this rule destroy the character of insurance in the  
medical industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Real insurance relies on actuarial tables, premiums that  
reflect risk (adjusted for any reason), and carefully grouped  
risk pools. A fat, cigar-smoking coach potato will have higher  
premiums than a member of the high-school swim team. If it is  
illegal to make a distinction, it's not business but welfare.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So title I, section 101 of this bill calls for "Guaranteed  
Availability of Health Coverage." Group health plans "may not  
establish eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contributions  
requirements" based on "health status, medical condition, claims  
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of  
insurability, or disability of a participants or beneficiary." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is an insurance company supposed to do if it can't  
assess the risk? Just dish out the big bucks. But can an insurer  
discreetly avoid certain professions based on their preponderance  
of sick employees? Nope: an insurance company "may not decline to" 
insure a person or group that demands it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this system, insurance companies cease to be market  
operations, working on the basis of profit and loss, and instead  
become middlemen in a socialist enterprise. But the Senate will  
take socialism only so far: pregnancy, unlike AIDS and other  
sexually transmitted diseases, is expressly excluded as a  
"pre-existing condition" (I,103,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If people's premiums can't go up and they can't be rejected  
based on bad behavior, there is less to be gained by preventive  
care. That's how the plan eliminates some of the incentives for  
people to take care of themselves and not overuse medical  
services.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The companies doing the insuring are even restricted in  
their ability to quit providing insurance. They have to give 180  
days notice if a plan is going to be discontinued (I,110(b)2).  
Then they have to wait five years before offering the plan again.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Remember the price controls implicit in the Clinton bill?  
You'll find them here too. The Secretary of Health and Human  
Services will devise "Federal standards that limit the variation  
in health insurance premiums" so that they will be "reasonably  
priced" (I,112,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Remember the bureaucracies in the Clinton health bill? This  
plan instructs the states, as overseen by the feds, to create  
"Health Plan Purchasing Coalitions" to determine the size and  
demographics of each risk pool (I, 131). The burden of proof is  
on the Coalition to show that it is not "discriminating."  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, this bill differs from the Clinton plan in only two  
ways: it is less ambitious and less honest. The Clinton plan  
included specific provisions that tried to account for every  
possible contingency. The Senate bill asserts broad  
principles--cheap health care for all!--but doesn't bother to  
specify how it's going to come about.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both plans are crazy, but is it wackier to wreck a sector  
with specific socialist instructions or broad socialist  
principles? Is it worse to specify the outcome or rig the game to  
ensure a certain outcome? Both are intolerable, although--as it  
turned out--only one could be enacted.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The bill's unanimous support is a measure not of merit, but  
of hypocrisy. For a year, the Republican Party dragged Hillary  
Clinton's name through the mud. Fine. She deserved it. But she  
also deserves an apology from everyone who denounced her bill and  
backed this one.

<title>Rockwell: Oil in the Crossfire -- 4/30/96</title>

<h2>
Oil in the Crossfire
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>


Now that National Hate AT&T Month is over, it's time to  
despise the oil companies. Call them any name you want: gougers,  
extortionists, or greed merchants. Make them the national enemy.  
It's a human rights violation to raise a price.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The occasion of the newest anti-capitalist hysteria is a  
one-year, 10% increase in gasoline prices at the pump. Never mind  
the underlying economic causes. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary  
is investigating the oil industry to discover who's getting rich  
at the driver's expense.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not to be left out, Connecticut's two Democratic  
Senators--Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman--are demanding that  
Attorney General Janet Reno knock the heads of oil companies with  
a stump. Heaven knows she can do it, even without resorting to  
tanks and CS gas. Anti-trust law can be bent to make any price  
pattern appear illegal.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For his part, President Clinton has decided to deal with the  
national emergency by dumping 12 million barrels onto the market  
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this reveals profound ignorance. Prices respond  
immediately to information about future demand and supply. If a  
credible announcement of a government oil sale didn't reduce the  
price, selling the oil won't do it either.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recall that this administration complains about foreigners  
dumping their goods on American markets at below cost. However, 
when it's our own government doing the dumping, it's not a  
vicious practice, but a responsible economic policy.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market specializes in allocating supplies over time via  
the price system. When supply is low and demand is high, prices  
rise to induce new drilling and distribution. In light of higher 
gasoline prices, consumers are already changing some summer  
travel plans, another market response.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market's price system works so well it doesn't need  
management at all. We don't have a strategic shoe or chicken  
reserve, yet, somehow, we walk and eat. But it's not free-market  
logic that's driving Mr. Clinton's blue light special. He's  
looking to profit politically--we might even call it vote  
gouging--at the expense of private industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A far better response--if highly atypical given their sorry  
record this year--comes from Republicans who are demanding a  
repeal of Mr. Clinton's 4.3 cent gas tax increase.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Democrats say the savings from a tax cut won't be "passed  
on" to the consumer. These are the same people who said a tax  
increase would be "passed on" two years ago. Not only that, they  
hoped it would be. In those days, you see, liberals agitated for  
higher gasoline prices as a way of inducing consumers to less, drive 
less, and "pollute" less.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals love oil price increases, especially when they're  
caused by taxes. It's the best of both worlds: people have less  
fun and government gets to siphon off new revenue.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The last time the nation went bonkers over gas prices was  
during the Gulf War. The U.S. government jeopardized imports from  
the entire Arab world, and President Bush (A.B. economics, Yale  
University) was amazed and alarmed to see prices go up. Like Mr.  
Clinton now, he attempted to jawbone companies into cutting  
prices. Corporate executives feared for their bottom lines.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There is always--as hard as government officials find this  
to accept--a purpose behind market-driven changes in price. If a  
good is more scarce, its price will rise so that people can know  
to use less of it. If it is more plentiful, its price will fall 
so consumers can know to live it up. Tampering with the system  
imposes unpredictable distortions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a country built by free enterprise, there is still mass  
ignorance on what accounts for a price increase in an industry.  
It's not greed, gouging, or illicit gas guzzling. It's either an  
increase in demand, a decrease in supply, or a response to money  
creation by the Fed. No use looking anywhere else.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just how badly do we want prices to fall? The best and  
surest way is to have free trade in oil. And, yes, that includes  
with Iraq, a country whose people have suffered immeasurably from  
the U.S.'s cruel and unusual sanctions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To end the war on the market before it escalates further, we  
need an end to embargoes, taxes, regulations, and inflation, all  
of which impede the right of Americans to determine their own  
strategic petroleum reserves.

<h2>
Beltway Bandits All
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservative pundits are having the time of their lives 
blasting Bob Dole, with several calling on him to drop out before 
the convention. The stated reason: his lifetime of politicking 
and state-building has put him hopelessly out of touch with the 
public's desire for real change in Washington. If he becomes the 
nominee, they say, Republicans will lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps so. At the same time, it's not fair to single out 
Mr. Dole for such scrutiny, while the leaders of the current 
Congress get off scot-free. After all, Newt Gingrich, Richard 
Armey, and Trent Lott are as much creatures of Washington as Mr. 
Dole. Their reluctance to upset the system that created them and 
sustains their power is what dashed the early hopes that this 
Congress would do something extraordinary. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that the public has not been impressed, the 
Republican leadership is at last getting defensive about its 
record. Mr. Armey, the House Majority Leader, was particularly 
incensed when a news story from the <i>New York Times</i> suggested, 
without further elaboration, that this Congress "has not 
accomplished much else despite its grand early promises" other
than welfare reform.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While hardly anyone would dispute this (even if the welfare 
reform looks piddling), Mr. Armey has taken grave offense. In 
thinking this way, he says, we are ignoring "the truth about the 
accomplishments of this Congress." He proceeds with a strange 
list of items that merely remind us of the extent that this 
Congress has indeed squandered the opportunity of a century. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey says "we achieved more than $53 billion in 
discretionary savings." But this is only an "accomplishment" if 
you keep track of the new additions to Congress's Dictionary of 
Budgetary Wordplay. The term "savings" here does not mean cuts, 
which Congress promised, or even cuts in the normal rate of 
increase. It refers to the difference between two artificial 
forecasts that Congress itself controls. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can try this technique at home. List all the purchases 
you have made this month, no matter how frivolous or how much you 
had to borrow to make them. Measure that against how much you 
would spend if you had  really  splurged. The difference between 
the two is how much you "saved" last month. This budgetary device 
can make your savings rate skyrocket--at least in your own mind. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The term "savings" is smoke and mirrors, while the official 
record will show that this Congress increased total government 
spending at the usual rate. The Congressional leadership has 
accepted and reinforced the Washington rule that spending must 
always increase at the rate of inflation, plus the rate of 
growth, for a total of 5 to 6 percent per year.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that some people may be on to this game, Mr. Armey 
turns to a page in the Art of Political Dissembling. He says 
Congress has balanced, by the year 2002, that "part of the budget 
that Congress controls." Let's say a three-pack-a-day smoker 
tries the same trick. If he announces "I have quit smoking by 
2002, at least the part I control," do you believe him?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Ronald Reagan was president, Republicans heaped scorn 
on the Democratic Congress when it claimed that it only 
controlled a portion of the budget. Now the Republican Congress 
uses the same implausible defense of its profligacy. If the 
Congress doesn't control the purse strings, who does?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While claiming not to control the budget, the Congressional 
leadership is also trying to evade other responsibilities. It 
passed an unconstitutional "line-item veto" which not only 
tramples on the separation of powers, but also vastly enhances
the political power of the next president, who will likely be 
Congress's supposed opponent. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other ways, Congress has stepped up government power, 
even over matters that should remain within its own internal 
purview. For example, in the words of Mr. Armey, the Congress 
made itself "subject to the same workplace standards and 
practices as the private sector." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sound good? In fact, there was a reason why Congress has 
never been subject to such laws. They are enforced by executive 
branch agencies like the Department of Labor, the Justice 
Department, and the EEOC. Private business knows how menacing 
these agencies can be, even to the point of determining workplace
composition with class-action lawsuits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already, individual Congressional offices are feeling the 
pressure to hire a "diverse" office, complete with quotas and 
affirmative action. This not only wrecks staff morale and 
cripples efforts to repeal these laws. It subjects Congressional 
offices to a subtle and corrupt domination by the president 
himself. Already, some offices have been pressured to end morning 
prayers for fear of violating the first amendment. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the New Deal, we have lived under an imperial 
executive that contradicts both the letter and spirit of the 
original Constitution (which instituted Congressional supremacy).
With these two acts--the line-item veto and regulation of 
legislative offices--executive-branch control is enhanced to 
dangerous new levels. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey claims that the agricultural bill represents 
revolutionary change, but here again is more bluster than 
substance. The farm bill merely changed the regulations to ensure 
agribusiness subsidies continue to flow in times when price 
supports has ceased to be profitable. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, there are the actions that Mr. Armey has pretended to 
forget about: tacitly approving the bailout of Mexico, a budget and 
power expansion for the BATF, and the authorization of privatized tax 
collection (tax farming, it was once called). Each case represents an 
increase in the degree and scope of federal government power, exactly 
the opposite of what this Congress promised. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now it appears that the leadership is accepting the newest 
conventional wisdom of media-land: Congress needs to pass some 
more legislation before the election to impress voters. Thus the 
leadership is conspiring to give us Hillary-lite in the form of 
new health insurance mandates and regulations, as well as an 
egregious increase in the minimum wage, guaranteed to raise the 
unemployment rate after this session closes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bob Dole deserves the aspersions being cast upon him, so 
does the entire Congressional leadership. If voters give them a 
whop on the nose this November, it won't be undeserved. It's time 
for men like Mr. Armey to 'fess up, so their coming political 
losses won't be interpreted as a verdict on the public's view 
that most of what the federal government does has outlived its 
usefulness.

An Insight Look
 By Thomas A. Schatz


The Oklahoma City tragedy was felt by every American.  Sympathy for 
the victims, particularly the innocent children, has hit hard.  The 
outpouring of emotion has been and will continue to be overwhelming, 
because Americans care and will do anything and give everything they 
can to help the victims and their families.

All indications are that some members of right-wing militias were 
involved.  Yet, even before all the victims were accounted for and 
properly mourned, some Americans began the "guilt-by-association" 
game.  First, all members of right-wing militia groups were at fault.  
Then, conservative groups of any kind were at fault.  The president 
implicated the radio talk show hosts and called for an end to "reckless 
speech" and  "loud and angry voices," asking Americans to speak out 
against "purveyors of hatred and division."  Then, heated anti-
government rhetoric was to blame for driving the fragile and twisted 
psyches of Timothy McVeigh and his cohorts over the edge.  Carl Rowan 
blamed Senate Majority Leader Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  
Radio talk shows and conservative politicians lashed back, accusing 
liberals of using the tragedy for their own political ends.  And the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation are said to share complicity because of the shootout with 
Randy Weaver and the Waco tragedy.  If anything, this display of 
shameful rhetoric and finger-pointing illustrates America's inability to 
deal with the issue of accountability.

In the wake of such sadness and grief, it is unseemly, grotesque even, for 
politicians and other public figures to make themselves the central figures 
in this tragedy.  And we should know from experience that blaming 
people simply because they hold similar views to those espoused by the 
alleged perpetrators is problematic.

Those who marched or otherwise protested against the war in Vietnam in 
an exercise of their First Amendment rights (including Bill Clinton) 
watched in horror when four students were killed at Kent State.  They 
shivered after learning of the Weather Underground campus bombings.  
After decades of oppression and discrimination, the Black Panthers 
became more militant and armed themselves.  Individuals from many of 
these movements committed crimes.  But in both of these cases, and 
many others throughout history, Americans didn't allow the misguided 
actions of a few extremists to annul or strip away the legitimate aims of 
the many.  

If one wants to make a connection between taxpayers, members of 
conservative organizations, radio talk show hosts, and the nuts that blew 
up the federal building in Oklahoma City, one must also make that same 
connection between taxpayers, members of liberal organizations, militant 
environmentalists, and the unabomber who struck again in California last 
week; or taxpayers, members of Christian fundamentalist churches, 
militant anti-abortionists, and the individual who shot the doctor in 
Pensacola, Florida.  The only real link in all of these examples is among 
the extremes on all sides and their willingness, for whatever twisted 
reasons, to resort to violence and murder.

The Oklahoma City bombing should neither be used as an excuse to 
attack the motivation of groups that seek less intrusive and more efficient 
government, nor as an excuse to perpetuate government programs which 
have simply become useless.  The budget debate, to take place 
imminently in the House and Senate, must go on.  In fact, if anything, 
that debate should be even more focused now on the proper role of 
government and the priorities that must be established for the future.

It's time to mourn, but it's also time to make decisions that will affect the 
standard of living for our children and grandchildren. 

Blunt talk, even when it seems harsh, has always been an element of 
American political discourse.  Tough action on the deficit must be taken 
on Capitol Hill.  Deliberating the merits of where and how to balance the 
budget will naturally evoke emotions on both sides of the aisle, especially 
now.  Eliminating obsolete programs, closing down entire departments, 
and reducing the massive increases in federal spending scheduled to take 
effect over the next several years is essential to the health and welfare of 
the American people and should not be inferred as a blanket abhorrence 
of all government, and certainly not the people that work within the 
system.

CAGW's Prime Cuts contains 651 recommendations to save $1.45 trillion 
over the next five years, including many that go back to the Grace 
Commission.  More than half come right from Congress' own 
Congressional Budget Office, and have been ignored.  President Clinton 
is right to call for increased law enforcement personnel and concentrated 
efforts to prevent domestic and international terrorism; that's an 
expenditure that CAGW can certainly support.  In fact, it's the sort of 
priority and choice that must be made on a much broader scale -- for 
every federal department, agency, and individual program.  That's what 
taxpayers are asking, and that's the task that must be carried out.

Keeping Congress on the Cutting Edge  
 By Thomas A. Schatz  
  
 
As the budget debate heats up on Capitol Hill, it is clear that  
sustaining the momentum of the first 100 days will be tough sledding  
for Republican leaders.  The rhetoric from the opponents of change has  
been and will continue to be harsh, unfounded, and misleading.  Inside  
the halls of Congress, the hand-wringing and whining at the undoing of  
years of wasteful and ineffective programs would make one believe the  
country will go down the drain in the near future.  
 
But taxpayers still want the revolution which began on November 8th of  
1994 with the election of a Republican Congress to be sustained.   
Outside the Washington beltway, support for reform remains strong.  
 
The truth is, without the changes being wrought in the new Congress,  
we will hit rock bottom and devastate the standard of living for  
future generations.  
 
The interest on the national debt is now almost twice as large as the  
budget deficit.  The president's budget projects a deficit of $192  
billion in fiscal year 1995 and an interest payment of $334 billion.   
In other words, without the interest on the national debt, there would  
be a surplus of $142 billion!  Over the next ten years, we could run a  
surplus every year if we did not have to pay the interest -- which  
will range from $330 billion to more than $500 billion -- and reduce  
the debt by $1,355 billion.  That, of course, is assuming that  
interest rates remain as projected.  If they go higher (remember a  
prime rate of nearly 21 percent in late 1980?), the results could be a  
Mexico-type disaster, where other countries will have to bail out the  
United States.  
 
But the forces of the status quo are doing everything in their power  
to fight the knights in shining armor -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- who are rescuing the future of our nation.  
 
Here's how the truth is being twisted:  
 
During the debate on the balanced budget amendment (BBA), the  
naysayers claimed that Social Security must be exempt.  The real  
threat to Social Security, as expressed by Sen. John Breaux, a  
Democrat from Louisiana, is if it is not exempt.  Keeping the program  
out of the BBA would give Congress the opportunity to add any program  
it wanted to "Social Security," which would undermine the basic old  
age, survivors and disability payments now provided to beneficiaries.   
For example, Congress could set up a special fund for student aid  
under Social Security, or for farmers, or veterans.  Already, Social  
Security disability funds are being used for cash payments to drug  
addicts and alcoholics, a well-publicized abuse of our tax dollars.   
Do we really want to leave that program untouchable under a balanced  
budget amendment?  And if a program is included in the exemption under  
Social Security, it is likely to expand dramatically as has been the  
practice in Washington.  The red herring of Social Security in the  
debate over the BBA was the first major volley in the battle to turn  
around the effort to eliminate the waste and the deficit.  
 
Social Security doesn't have to be involved at all in the budget  
debate: Representatives Jerry Solomon (R-N.Y.) and Mark Neumann (R- 
Wisc.) have proposed a budget that would truly remove Social Security  
from the furor of how to rein in federal spending.  Their plan would  
not only balance the budget in five years by freezing all spending at  
current levels, it would eliminate the debt in thirty years by  
increasing spending by one percent less than revenues through the year  
2025 in their budget proposal.  Their list of options includes $70  
billion more than is necessary to balance the budget within five  
years.  
 
According to opponents, the provisions of the House welfare bill will  
result in millions of children being left in the streets, and massive  
homelessness and starvation.  But these alarmists failed to note that  
spending more than $5 trillion since 1965 in the war against poverty  
has not solved the problem.  The House bill moves in a new direction,  
which is apparently too much for the defenders of the status quo to  
handle.  
 
Spending on welfare will increase by only $60 billion less than  
projected in President Clinton's FY 1996 budget.  The school lunch  
program will increase by four percent per year instead of six percent  
per year over the next five years.  This is fiscal restraint, not  
heartlessness.  Claiming that children will be starving on the streets  
is just a little too melodramatic to hold water.  
 
The truth will win out, and the waste will be cut.  But the job is far  
from over.  We must preserve the future for our children and  
grandchildren.

DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:  WHAT WENT WRONG 
 By: Thomas Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste 
 

This past March, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste 
(CCAGW) held a regional taxpayers' conference in Denver.  It's ironic 
that the leading group fighting waste had to fly into a prime example 
of why America is currently strangled by a $4.8 trillion national debt 
-- the new Denver International Airport (DIA).  Assessing what went 
wrong with the Denver Airport is critically important.    

According to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation 
and the General Accounting Office (GAO), $685 million will be spent by 
the federal government on the Denver Airport through fiscal year (FY) 
2001.  Every single dollar of this $685 million will be wasted.   This 
is not an overstatement because this airport was not needed.  Plain 
and simple.  Stapleton Airport could have been upgraded to accommodate 
any larger planes that might land in Denver in the future.  Extending 
runways at Stapleton would have been inexpensive and quick.  But 
because this country has an edifice complex, a new structure had to be 
built.  When a family has a tight budget, they don't go to the opera 
or drive an expensive car.  The federal government has to realize that 
we cannot afford luxuries, especially when there isn't a need for such 
a luxury. 
 
Just as the federal government has become adept at deficits, so will 
DIA.  The GAO projected a cumulative operating deficit of  $230 
million by its February opening.  
 
The DIA is government waste -- at its worst.  DIA is not an example of 
pork-barrel waste.  The kind of government waste that occurred in 
Denver is more insidious.  The back-room politicking and the 
misinformation that occurred is an embarrassment to the federal 
government as well as the local government.   

The new 53-square-mile airport is larger than the District of 
Columbia.  The airport is 25 miles from downtown.  A cab ride will 
increase from $7 to Stapleton to $50 to DIA.  There is currently no 
supporting infrastructure to serve the new airport.  Access to rental 
cars and hotels is extremely difficult.  These are the general 
problems.  Here are the specific problems with DIA.   

The public was shut out of the process, and no user or public needs 
were defined or documented.  The politicians limited the vote to the 
core city, or about 10 percent of airport users.  Denver is a 
relatively small city of 460,000, down six percent in population in 
the 1980's.  Denver is not among the top 400 cities worldwide, yet the 
city set out to build the "World's Largest Airport."  Only about 70 
gates out of 200 are actually in operation at DIA.  A dozen or so 
gates are not in operation because of a lack of covered jetways.  Thus 
incoming flights are delayed.  
 
The Denver Airport has come to symbolize the reckless manner in which 
federal construction is carried out in America.  Because the airport 
is eligible for formula grants, money is not awarded based on merit.  
If this were a project that was being funded by a private financial 
institution, more scrutiny would have gone into the planning, 
implementation and construction of this airport.  The federal 
government should not be providing an open checkbook for construction 
based on the fact that it creates jobs.   The $685 million that the 
federal government will spend through 2001 could mean $1,489 in tax 
relief for every resident of Denver. 

There was no need for a new airport in Denver.  During the 1986-1989 
planning period, Denver's share of the U.S. air travel market dropped 
53 percent -- from 3.8 percent in 1986 to 2.57 percent in 1990 (1994 
is estimated at 2.6 percent).  However, during those years, the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Denver forecast that DIA 
would be the fastest-growing airport in the U.S., with 50 million 
passengers by 1995, and the second-busiest by 2000.  According to the 
Air Transportation Association (ATA), Denver also dropped from 8th to 
19th in U.S air cargo tonnage during the past five years.  The ATA has 
never included Denver in the "Table of Top 30 U.S. Domestic Air Travel 
Markets."  Top listings are high population cities and vacation 
centers.  Denver is neither. 
 
According to Mayor Pea in Volume I of the 1987 Airport Report, 
"Stapleton had the best history of low delays.  Stapleton was ranked 
number five in traffic and number nine in delays."  The Pea 
administration in 1988 decided to trash Stapleton, then one of the 
best airports in the world, to build a totally new airport for $1.5 
billion.  Mr. Pea's 1989 Airport Report claimed "Stapleton was grid 
locking the nation," and by 1996 "is expected to lead the delay list 
with 158,000 hours annually."   Federal funding for DIA was to be $500 
million, and the "Stapleton site would be disposed of over several 
years to raise more than a half-billion dollars."   The projected cost 
is now more than $4.9 billion.   

The bottom line is:  DIA is expensive and unnecessary.  The new Denver 
Airport should not have been built.  The way that it was built is an 
embarrassment to representative government at all levels.   
 
What will the real losses be at DIA?  How soon will the losses eat up 
the reserves set aside to pay the bondholders?  Who will pay for the 
bailout -- the city and county of Denver, Colorado's taxpayers, or the 
federal government?  Who will be left holding the bag when this 
airport fails?  The American taxpayer will be left in the lurch again.

The Long Hot Summer Ahead   
 Thomas A. Schatz 
 Citizens Against Government Waste
 May 18, 1995 
 

 Outsiders usually aren't surprised -- and often think it appropriate  
-- when they learn that much of Washington was built on a swamp.  
While that fact only partially accounts for the hot gases that tend to 
swirl here, this summer promises to be stickier than most, with 
rhetorical fireworks flying that could dwarf the pyrotechnics on the 
4th of July.    

 Freon will be in short supply as the battle of the budget burns 
through the summer and into September.  The deficit hawks, promising a 
balanced budget by 2002, will square off against the special interests 
and sentinels of the status quo, who, as one Republican leader has 
said, have nothing to offer but fear itself.  At stake are the hearts 
and minds of everyday Americans and the political high ground as we 
move into an election year.   

 While every battle seems decisive from the perspective of the 
interlocked combatants, this time it's no exaggeration.  The outcome 
will determine whether future Americans are born debt-free, whether 
the growth of government can be reversed, whether the will of average 
taxpayers can prevail over the more focused energies of special 
interests, and whether Americans are still capable of sacrificing in 
the short term to safeguard the future.   

 The balanced budget proposals recently put forward -- reductions in 
spending of $1.4 trillion in the House and $961 billion in the Senate 
over seven years -- provide a game plan only, establishing broad 
budgetary parameters.  The specific cuts and final shape of the 
package will be hashed out during the summer.  Which components live 
or die will be determined in part by the war of words, by the ebb and 
flow of public opinion.     

 Even if every cut or reduction in growth being proposed survives, 
government spending will still grow from $1.53 trillion this year to 
$1.8 trillion in 2002.  Social Security spending, the "third rail" of 
American politics, is off the table.  Medicare (which will be bankrupt 
by 2002 without reform) will grow as well, but at a more manageable 
rate than 10 percent a year, its current pace.  At least one and 
perhaps as many as three federal departments could be eliminated 
altogether.  Hundreds of anachronistic agencies and programs will fall 
by the wayside.  These, in short, are some of the most dramatic 
changes in the size and scope of government since the heady days of 
the Great Society.  Only this time, contraction is the goal, rather 
than expansion.   

 What avenues will be taken to arrive at a smaller, more affordable 
government?  The first is privatization -- as first proposed by the 
Grace Commission more than a decade ago.  As the late J. Peter Grace 
recognized, there are many public entities that could stand alone as 
private, profit-making ventures.  Capitol Hill budget cutters are 
looking to privatize the Federal Aviation Administration, the Naval 
and Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and the National Helium Reserves.  
Also likely to be sold off are the nation's five Power Marketing 
Administrations, which sell power generated by federally-built 
hydroelectric facilities.  To this list, Citizens Against Government 
Waste would add the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Weather 
Service, the space shuttle program, and the military commissary 
system.   

 Next is consolidation --  putting the government's self-duplicating 
and redundant functions under a single roof and reversing the 
politically-driven proliferation of cabinet-level agencies.  Should we 
do away with the Department of Energy, created in response to the 
energy crisis of the 1970's, its responsibility for nuclear weapons 
labs and facilities could easily be subsumed by the Department of 
Defense.  The Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway 
Safety Administration should be merged.  The military's four, separate 
health-care bureaucracies should be placed under single management.  
And there's much more consolidation that could be done.   

 When all else fails, there's always termination.  It's been said that 
there's nothing in the world more permanent than a temporary federal 
program.  The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a prime 
example.  Thirty years after being launched as a component of Lyndon 
Johnson's Great Society, the ARC serves today as little more than a 
pork-barrel for opportunistic politicians.  Three-quarters of a 
million dollars in ARC "anti-poverty" funds will be spent this year 
helping to build a practice facility for the NFL Carolina Panthers at 
a private college in Spartanburg, South Carolina, one of the most 
affluent counties in that state.  The Economic Development 
Administration, another anachronistic agency that should be 
terminated, has chipped in $500,000 more for the stadium.  The 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the bureaucracy that wouldn't die and 
occupies itself today publishing pamphlets about how to start a small 
railroad, also begs for a wooden stake through the heart.  There are 
many others that need to be added to the Endangered Bureaucracies 
List.   

 Another concept gaining popularity in Washington is "devolution," 
which is short-hand for returning power, money, and responsibility for 
administering certain programs back to the states.  The states, each 
working as individual laboratories, or incubators for innovation, will 
manage these programs more efficiently.  If all goes according to 
plan, Medicaid will be delivered to the states as a block grant, 
letting them dispense it as they see fit, as will food stamps.  Other 
welfare reform measures will also be downloaded to the state level.   

 Finally, even if the size of the federal government is reduced, much 
more can be done to make it run more like a business.  While not very 
"sexy," financial management reform is essential if we want the most 
efficient government for the money.  Unless there is full 
implementation of the Chief Financial Officers Act, and the 
bureaucracy is compelled to deliver timely, trustworthy financial 
reports, the ship of state sails in a fog and our leaders have no way 
to know which reforms are working and which aren't.   

 The road to a balanced budget won't be without its potholes: the 
whole effort may succumb to politics as usual and break down before it 
even gets going.  To succeed, many sacred cows will have to be put out 
to pasture.  Many old ways of thinking about government will have to 
be discarded.  We'll have to forge ahead even when the Chicken Littles 
and special interests say that the sky is falling.  After decades of 
saying "Yes," Washington's political class will have to bring itself 
to say "No."  In turn, voters will have to reward those who have the 
courage to say "No," holding up fiscal prudence rather than 
piggishness as a virtue, and learn to stop turning to the federal 
government for the solution to every imaginable problem.  An America 
increasingly fractured into adversarial special interests, each 
fighting for a piece of the pie, will have to find a way to coalesce 
around a new set of affordable national priorities.   

 In short, the era of governmental limits and fiscal responsibility 
won't be born without a long, painful, and noisy labor.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<title>The Peanut Shell Game</title>

<h2>The Peanut Shell Game</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b> By:  Thomas A. Schatz: President, Citizens Against Government Waste</b>
<p>   
Since the days of the Great Depression, American farming communities have lived under the umbrella of government subsidies.  These assistance measures, initiated because of unstable market conditions, create strong dependency as farmers cling to the benefits of government intervention.     
<p>  
As a result of these programs, the American farmer is enriched and capitalizes on his position, while substantially distorting the agricultural market.  Through quotas and government handouts, farmers receive above-market prices, crop failure relief, and engage in a feudalistic method of production.  For the taxpayer and consumer,   
agricultural subsidy programs increase prices and waste tax dollars through needless expenditures.   
<p>
Established in 1933 as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the peanut subsidy program stabilized agricultural income through price supports and production control.  Subsidies were welcome because one-fourth of the U.S. population resided in rural areas and farm earnings were well below national average income statistics, constituting a mere 53 percent of a nonfarm family's salary.  In 1933, the Chairman   
of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Marvin Jones (D-Texas), believed in the necessity of the bill, but noted that the President "would surrender such programs when the emergency (was) past."  In 1934, FDR's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, said, "The present program for readjusting productive acreage to market requirements is admittedly but a temporary method of dealing with an emergency.  It could not be relied upon as a permanent means of keeping farm production in line with market requirements."   
<p>
The emergency is over and the dynamics of farming have changed.  The number of farms have decreased by 69 percent, from 6.8 million farms in 1935  to 2 million farms today.  More importantly, the average income of a farm family now exceeds $39,000, higher than a nonfarm family's average income.  With the number of farms decreasing and the stabilization of agricultural income, programs such as peanut   
subsidies are relics of a bygone era.    
<p>
Peanuts are an important political and financial cash crop in the South.  The "Peanut Belt" stretches from Tidewater, Virginia to the New Mexican plateau and produces 5 billion pounds of peanuts, with an estimated value of $1.4 billion.  The political consequences outweigh the financial when it comes to eradicating the peanut program.   
<p>
Administered through the USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the peanut program consists of two mandates. First, the program controls the domestic supply of peanuts through a  poundage quota system.  This Soviet-style regulatory approach sets limits on production and allocates who should produce the specified amount.  Second, by restraining the domestic supply through the quota   
system, the government sets a minimum selling price for all domestic sales.  With a domestic support price of $714 per ton compared to a  world price of $494 per ton, domestic prices are 44.5 percent higher than the average world market price.  Domestic buyers must pay this higher price.  Subsidies are in direct contrast to the American ideal of free trade, which embraces the lowest cost and most efficient   
producer.   
<p>
The federal government is merely evoking a feudalistic system that benefits a few large farms while suppressing the rest.  Although anyone can grow peanuts, only those who have quota land can grow peanuts for domestic, price-supported use.  Thus, non-quota owners must either rent land that is part of the quota system, or settle for   exportation at the world market price.  Seventy percent of quota  
holders rent their land to peanut farmers, making $208 million a year in rental fees without growing one single peanut.  Contrary to popular political folklore, small farmers are not benefiting from the peanut program.  Currently, 80 percent of the quotas to grow domestic peanuts are owned by 20 percent of peanut farmers.   
<p>
To arrive at the appropriate price support amount, the government uses  the national average production cost.  Based on increases in the prices paid by producers for commodities and services, interest, taxes, and wage rates, the government then deciphers an increased fair price without considering the costs of producing peanuts.  In an  absurd twist of fate, if peanut production costs drop, the fixedsupport price still might rise, based on the entire U.S. average of  production costs.  Historically, the gap between quota support prices and costs has increased every year.   
<p>
Government control does not stop at the quotas and price supports. The USDA uses these two prescriptions for further market interruptions.  First, under law, peanut farmers may sell their peanuts directly to the government instead of market buyers.    
Regardless of crop conditions, peanut farmers have a guaranteed buyer-- the federal government -- at or above the inflated domestic price.  If the government cannot sell all of the collected peanuts to the public sector, then the rest will be sold for oil or meal at substantially lower prices.  In the end, the government picks up the price difference between the high price support and the market price.   
<p> 
Money spent by both the consumer and the government is not worth these results.  Every American farmer deserves a free market in which to develop efficiency and gain market share through his own right, not a government-given quota.  According to the General Accounting Office, consumers spend an additional $513 million a year for peanut products such as Peanut Butter and Kung Pao Chicken, excessive profits   
transferred to the peanut producers.  In the long run, these high   prices will hurt the peanut industry as consumers look to other lower-priced products.  In 1990, there was a 10 percent drop in the food industry's demand for peanuts.    
<p>
The $119 million spent by the federal government on the peanut program annually doesn't even take into account the administrative fees. The  price tag for the peanut program exceeds $200 million when administrative costs are calculated.     
<p>
This subsidy must end.  Consumers and taxpayers must not foot the bill   for this absurd manipulation of our strong hallowed market economy. This shell game of peanut subsidies must be cracked wide open and stopped.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people.

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<h2>Stop Federalizing Local Crimes</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P>
                       
The hearings and report of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Terrorism,  
Technology and Government Information prove again the importance and value  
of Congressional investigations. This function of Congress operates as the  
best, and often the only, way to expose the misdeeds of government.  
  <P>
For three years, the news of the killing of an innocent women and child on  
a remote Idaho mountaintop by an FBI sharpshooter, and the subsequent  
coverup by the FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, had been known only to  
readers of right-wing newsletters and surfers on the Internet. Newspapers  
and TV networks didn't find those actions worth reporting.  
  <P>
Finally, Senator Arlen Specter's subcommittee, with the C-span cameras  
rolling, laid the ugly story out for all to see. The 154-page subcommittee  
report just released assessed blame on everybody involved in the shootout,  
but the part that should concern us most is the outrageous actions of  
federal law- enforcement agencies.  
  <P>
The role of the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) began with  
spreading false and defamatory information about Randy Weaver and concluded  
with continuing to defend inexcusable conduct. The FBI's role included  
firing the fatal shots, lying about who was to blame, defending the  
constitutional "shoot-on-sight" actions, and promoting the bureaucrat in  
charge of the mess.  
  <P>
Specter rightfully suggests that the BATF ought to be abolished. The FBI  
should be punished, too, since Director Louis Freeh's statement that the  
Bureau is now better prepared for "volatile situations like Ruby Ridge" is  
a totally inadequate response.  
  <P>
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese points out in the current issue of  
Policy Review that the Ruby Ridge and Waco (Branch Davidian) tragedies have  
fundamentally changed the way Americans view federal law enforcement  
agencies and have jeopardized public confidence in government itself. His  
recommendation is much more fundamental than a mere transfer of agency  
functions and suspension of several agents.  
  <P>
As Meese explains, Ruby Ridge and Waco were, constitutionally speaking,  
none of the Federal government's business in the first place. Neither  
incident involved interstate activity or posed a threat to the Federal  
Government.  
  <P>
The underlying problem is that so many criminal laws and laws regulating  
firearms have been federalized. Until very recent years, everything  
involved at Ruby Ridge and Waco would have been handled under state and  
local laws (if, indeed, there were anything to handle at all, since the  
Ruby Ridge sequence of events only started when a BATF agent entrapped  
Randy Weaver into committing a minor violation of a firearms law).  
  <P>
What has happened is that so many politicians, seeking to portray  
themselves as tough on crime, have passed so many laws creating new federal  
crimes and stiffer penalties. They should know that these laws are not in  
harmony with our Constitution and that crime is most effectively fought at  
the local level, anyway.  
  <P>
Meese explains that federalizing crime contradicts constitutional  
principles. The U.S. Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only  
three crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and  
offenses against the law of nations. Responsibility for public safety rests  
solely in the domain of the states.  
  <P>
Now, however, Congress has created more than 3,000 federal crimes, many of  
them redundant with state laws. Hardly any crime, no matter how local, is  
now beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities.  
  <P>
A big part of the federalizing of crime is the criminalization of  
environmental regulations. Many of these federal environmental crimes are  
local in nature, and they are often so vague that some property owners  
violate the law without realizing it.  
  <P>
Meese accurately says that federalizing crime increases "the potential for  
an oppressive and burdensome federal police state." Ruby Ridge and Waco  
prove that proposition; the spokesmen for the two federal agencies never  
admitted that the government did anything wrong.  
  <P>
Another bad result of federalizing crime is the added jurisdiction and  
power this gives to the federal courts. Activist federal judges have  
greatly expanded the rights of criminal defendants, have further burdened  
law- enforcement agencies, and have virtually taken over the operation of  
80 percent of all state prison systems.  
  <P>
Since crime usually tops the list when voters are asked what they are  
concerned about, Republicans like to pose as law-and-order spokesmen. Its  
time for them to address themselves to the real problems that are properly  
Congress's responsibility, and admit that law-and-order is a state and  
local function.

<h2>Kudos For General Dan "SDI" Graham </h2>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><P>
Can one person really make a difference in this country of 250,000,000  
people? The life of General Daniel O. Graham, who passed away on New Year's  
Eve, gives a stunningly affirmative answer.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham, whose first love was the cavalry, liked to quote an old  
proverb. For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the  
horse was lost; for want of the horse, the battle was lost. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That proverb defines his place in history. For want of Dan Graham, Ronald  
Reagan would not have had the vision of a defense against ballistic  
missiles called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); for want of  
Reagan's leadership, the United States would not have had a project called  
SDI; and for want of the SDI project and the threat of what it could do,  
the Cold War would have been lost.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is now clear that we won the Cold War when Mikhail Gorbachev reluctantly  
concluded that he couldn't talk Reagan out of SDI (at Geneva or elsewhere),  
and that the miserable Soviet economy couldn't match U.S. expenditures for  
building a nuclear defense. When Reagan called on Gorbachev to tear down  
the Berlin Wall, the media laughed; but SDI turned that "pie-in-the-sky"  
prediction into reality.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democratic-controlled Congresses never voted the funds to deploy SDI,  
but they did tolerate limited funding for research and development.  
Fortunately that (combined with the collapsing Soviet economy) turned out  
to be enough to checkmate Gorbachev. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had a much-decorated 30-year military career that included  
service in Germany, Korea and Vietnam and was capped by serving as director  
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In retirement, he rejected lucrative  
offers from defense contractors and dedicated his life to American national  
defense.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ronald Reagan's military adviser in his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, Dan  
Graham laid out for his candidate the folly and culpable negligence of the  
Federal Government's leaving America totally undefended against incoming  
nuclear missiles. Graham's coaching led Ronald Reagan to articulate the  
crucial question on March 23, 1983: "Would it not be better to save lives  
than to avenge them?"  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's national grand strategy, developed by Secretary of Defense Robert  
McNamara in the early 1960s, was still in 1983 totally based on killing  
Russians instead of on protecting the lives of Americans. This strategy,  
called Mutual Assured Destruction, was known by its appropriate acronym  
MAD.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This theory proclaimed the notion that the way to avoid nuclear war was (a)  
not to build any defensive weapons, but instead (b) to threaten the Soviets  
that, if they fired their nuclear missiles at us, we would retaliate with  
our offensive nukes and kill tens of millions of Russians. If this scenario  
ever took place, tens of millions of Americans would die because our  
government had done nothing at all to protect them.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;MAD was a suicide pact -- a strategy of revenge, rather than defense. Dan  
Graham said there must be a better way.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The better way developed by Graham was originally called High Frontier  
(because space is the high frontier of America's future), and was later  
called SDI. It is a plan for a layered defense, in which non-nuclear  
weapons shot from satellites in space and from ground bases in this country  
would destroy enemy nuclear missiles in flight before they incinerated  
Americans.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham had the vision that a defense was both essential and doable, he  
was the salesman who persuaded Ronald Reagan and other public officials and  
opinion makers that it was sound political and military strategy, he  
assembled the scientists and engineers who proved it would work, he raised  
the funds to do all of the above, and he was a veritable machine grinding  
out refutations of the attacks launched on High Frontier/SDI by those  
determined to mislead the public with deceptive criticisms.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had to fend off the Ted Kennedy claque who tried to ridicule  
High Frontier as "Star Wars," and the liberal Democrats who are viscerally  
opposed to spending any money on defense. Graham had to withstand  
opposition from Paul Nitze and the internationalists who opposed SDI  
because they sought nuclear disarmament through international agencies, and  
from the arms control lobby, which had a vested interest in continuing  
their jobs attending international meetings where they tilted about arcane  
nuclear weapons statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization  
which funded SDI, claiming that it is "on a collision course with the ABM  
treaty." That document is a relic of the Cold War, which continues to  
impose MAD on us and restricts our constitutional right to "provide for the  
common defense."  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nuclear threat today is from attacks by the several rogue nations that  
now possess ballistic missiles. The ABM treaty cannot protect us against  
them, but SDI can.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where there is no vision, the people perish." General Daniel O. Graham had  
the vision for a "Defense that Defends." As a fitting tribute to a great  
patriot, let us work to make it a reality.

<h2>The Fraud and the Failure Called Welfare </h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>

<p><P>
The disaster called welfare was probably the biggest single issue that 
ousted the Democratic majority in Congress in the landmark election of 
1994. Even President Clinton said he wanted to "end welfare as we know it." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True to their Contract with America, the Republican Congress passed welfare 
reform. It wasn't a perfect piece of legislation, of course. There is no 
way this $5 trillion fraud and failure, with so many vested interests, 
could be perfected by one law in one year. But it was a giant step in the 
right direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill, so we're back to square one. 
The federal taxpayers will have to go on spending $234 billion annually, 
plus another $100 billion in state welfare spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lyndon Johnson's Great Society set up a grossly unjust and immoral system 
in the mid-1960s whereby millions of people were taught that they had an 
"entitlement." They became "entitled" to pick the pockets of lawabiding, 
taxpaying families if they met two conditions: they didn't work, and they 
were not married to someone who does work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The major problem is that welfare pays better than jobs that welfare 
recipients can hope to get. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A recent Cato Institute study laid out comparative figures based on the 
cash payments and non-cash benefits paid by our welfare system to a single 
mother with two children. There are 77 different sources of welfare money, 
but the principal pipelines are AFDC, food stamps, medicaid, housing, 
utilities, WIC, and commodities. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, the average welfare mother receives cash and benefits 
amounting to $20,000 a year. In medium-level welfare states, she gets 
$17,500 per year. And it's all tax-free! 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 39 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to an $8 per hour job. In New 
York and Washington, D.C., welfare benefits are equivalent to a $12 an hour 
job, two and a half times the minimum wage. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the salary of a 
first-year teacher. In 28 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the 
pay of a starting secretary. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, all welfare recipients don't receive this much, but some get 
more. The conclusion is that it pays to be on welfare and there is no real 
hope of getting people off welfare until the benefits are less than a 
minimum wage job. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When LBJ started the current welfare system, it was called the "war on 
poverty." Indeed, it was a war against families, taxpayers, and even 
against the people it was supposed to help. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's bad enough that the war on poverty took so much spendable income out 
of the pockets of hard-working Americans. It's worse that it is a no-win 
war, initiated by the same Administration that gave us the Vietnam War. We 
are waiting for its perpetrators to admit, like Robert S. McNamara, that 
they were "wrong, terribly wrong." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the worst of it is that the liberal welfare system has perpetrated such 
horrendous damage on our society. It has broken up millions of families, 
prevented more millions of families from forming, produced seven million 
illegitimate children, created a pathetic underclass that will never 
achieve what we like to call the American Dream, virtually destroyed our 
great cities, and spawned the social problems that flow from illegitimacy 
such as drugs, delinquency, and dropouts. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare system tells a teenage girl, who is doing poorly in school, 
doesn't know who her father is, isn't getting along with her mother, and 
hates her surroundings, "We'll take you out of all this, set you up in an 
apartment of your own, send you a check every month, and give you your own 
food stamps, housing allotment, health care, and commodities. All you have 
to do to get all these goodies is have an illegitimate baby." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprise, surprise, more illegitimate babies were born to teenagers. So the liberals offered another government "solution": "family planning." That's a 
euphemism for the massive distribution of contraceptives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Title X taxpayer funding started in 1970 for the purpose of reducing 
unmarried teen pregnancies. After 25 years, the result is total disaster; 
every measure of teenage health is dramatically worse. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illegitimate births to teenagers have doubled, the teenage abortion rate 
has more than doubled, sexual activity rates are far higher and at a 
younger age, and sexually transmitted diseases have skyrocketed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the liberals whine about how the so-called Religious Right is 
"imposing its morals" on the rest of society, remember that they are like 
the thief who cries "stop, thief" to distract from his own thievery. 
Welfare is the prime example of the Irreligious Left imposing its lack of 
morals on the rest of society.

<h2>
The Road Map To Real Reform In Education 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
Every now and then a book comes along, such as Rachel Carson's "Silent 
Spring" or Ralph Nader's "Unsafe At Any Speed," that dramatically alters 
the focus of an entire industry. "Teaching Our Children to Read" by Bill 
Honig can be such a book. It could change our entire educational system, 
not because the book will be a best-seller, but because of the author's 
credibility among educators. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig is no hero to conservatives, or to disaffected parents demanding 
school choice, or even to critics demanding school "standards" and 
"reform." He was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California, 
1983-1993, where he presided over a school system that exemplified all the 
failures and abuses we've been complaining about for years. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apparently, when he left office two years ago, Honig sincerely set about to 
find out why public schoolchildren are not learning how to read. He started 
from the reasonable assumption that "the first and foremost job of 
elementary school is to teach children to read." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important point Honig makes, repeated at least a dozen times, is 
that a child absolutely must be "reading beginning books by mid-first 
grade." Honig emphasizes that those who miss out in the early first grade 
need "organized intervention" immediately, because otherwise they "almost 
never recover." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading success depends on the child developing the ability to pick out the 
smallest "sound chunks" that make up words. Honig says that "the amount of 
time a student is engaged in phonics instruction is highly predictive of 
subsequent reading achievement." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The discipline manifested in Honig's book is extraordinary. It contains no 
confessions, no mea culpas, no I-told-you-sos, no recriminations, no 
put-downs, no pejoratives, no assessing of credit or blame, no targeting of 
enemies, no sanctimonious self- righteousness. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig's book is just a straightforward explanation, based on voluminous 
research and empirical evidence, of how children can and should be taught 
to read. It's a fair inference that its message is a plea for the schools 
to get going on this task because, if the schools fail in this preeminent 
mission, nothing else matters. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A Great Debate has been going on for years between the advocates of phonics 
(i.e., teaching the child to sound out the syllables of the English 
language and put them together like building blocks) and the advocates of 
Whole Language (i.e., teaching the child to guess at the words by looking 
at the pictures and to substitute words that fit the context of the story). 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig calls the phonics-Whole Language debate a "destructive controversy," 
asserts that it should not be an "either/or" question, and recommends a 
"balanced" approach. This is a skillful way of assuring that semantics do 
not screen out the meat of his presentation. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He bows to the Whole Language movement, crediting it with introducing 
children to "good literature." But Honig reminds us that exposure to good 
literature "only works if the student actually reads the words correctly -- 
making mistakes doesn't help." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, Honig exposes the Whole Language myth that the child will learn 
"naturally," without explicit instruction in skills, in the same way that a 
child learns to talk. He says this false belief is far too prevalent and 
has had the "disastrous" result that 30% to 40% of urban children can't 
read at all and more than 50% can't read at their grade level. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig explains that "bad habits of guessing" make learning to read much 
more difficult, and these bad habits cannot be remedied by a sporadic, 
unsystematic use of phonics. He says that "beginning readers who rely too 
heavily on contextual clues, such as pictures or the connection of other 
words in the passage, are distracted from looking at the letters in a word 
and connecting those letter patterns to words in their minds." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig argues for teaching children to write and to spell accurately in the 
first grade, too. "Inventive spelling" shouldn't be allowed past mid-first 
grade; children's misspellings should be corrected so erroneous patterns 
are not reinforced. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How widespread are wrong teaching methods in public schools today? Honig 
says that "very few instructional programs currently in use provide 
children with materials designed specifically to connect with systematic 
and sequenced skills development. In some cases, state, county, district, 
or university leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills 
components and discourage phonics teaching." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This isn't a book for parents. Honig obviously thinks that parents have no 
direct role in the mechanics of teaching children to read because that's 
the job for the public school. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, most parents won't be able to cope with his endless educrat 
jargon: phonological awareness and processing, phonemic segmentation, 
explicit skill development strand, word-attack skills, alphabetic 
principle, orthographic phase, syntactic awareness, and metacognitional and 
strategic assistance. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this highfalutin way of talking about phonics is just right for 
teachers, administrators and policymakers. It's a road map to get them back 
on the track of teaching children how to read, which should be the schools' 
number-one mission.

<h2>
The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The aging feminist leaders gathered in Washington earlier this month amid
self-doubts about whether they are relevant any more. "We want to end this
discussion about the death of feminism," proclaimed the organizer of this
Feminist Expo '96 and its most voluble spokesperson, Eleanor Smeal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Feminism is in its death throes because it seeks unattainable goals at
variance with reality, common sense, and fairness. In the 1970s and 1980s,
the feminists sought a "gender-neutral" society; their goal was to be
treated exactly like men.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminist "party line" today is obsessed with victimology as the problem
and affirmative action as the solution: they see the world as one gigantic
male conspiracy against women. The feminists' goal is reverse
discrimination quotas for women in hiring and promotions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We hear endless whining about "equal pay for equal work," but that's been
the law of the land for 33 years. What they really want is reverse
discrimination quotas to give women equal pay for unequal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists use "Glass Ceiling" as a code word for quotas for
professional and executive women, and "comparable worth" as the code word
for quotas for skilled white and blue collar jobs. (Unskilled jobs are
never on the feminists' radar screen.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' mantra is, "a woman earns only 72 cents for every dollar a
man earns." That statement is false on its face, first, because of the
dishonest use of the word "every." It might be correct if the sentence
read, "The average woman earns 72 percent of the earnings of the average
man," but that would be meaningless because it's unrelated to how much work
the average man or woman does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans don't believe in equal pay for everyone (that's a Marxist
notion). We believe in equal pay for equal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you relate earnings to work performed, male and female gender profiles
are very different. A recent research paper by the Pacific Research
Institute of San Francisco provides overwhelmingly persuasive
documentation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The slogans "wives have to work" and "it takes two incomes to support a
family today" obscure public understanding of the powerful effect that
marriage has on workforce earnings, and 81 percent of women do marry. As
the scholar Thomas Sowell has shown, marriage has exactly the opposite
effect on the earnings of men and women.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Married men with children earn the most, while married women with children
earn the least. As the number of children increases, a married man works
more hours in the workforce and a married woman works fewer hours.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994 only 55% of women worked 40 or more hours a week compared to 75% of
men. While 16% of men worked 55 or more hours a week, only 6% of women did.
It's ridiculous to compare earnings without relating them to whether
produced by full-time or part-time employment.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the benefit of feminists who need to have the obvious stated: people
who work more earn more, and they should. The principal income gap is not
between women and men, but between married women and everyone else, and
that is primarily the result of a voluntary domestic division of labor, not
labor-force discrimination by a conspiracy of men. Women who remain single,
invest in education, stay in the labor force, and work long hours fare
about as well as men in the labor market.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' next line of attack is to assert that, even when you compare
levels of education, or highest college level attained, Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures show a sizeable differential (they call it
discrimination) between men's and women's earnings. But comparing incomes
by the highest degree earned reveals individual choices made by women, and
correlation does not prove cause.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1992, one out of four women who earned Ph.D.s did so in education,
whereas one out of five men earned a Ph.D. in engineering. The mean monthly
income of education majors is $3,048, and of engineering graduates is
$4,049 (a third higher). Personal choices produced those results; no
gestapo forced women to major in fields that pay less.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at master's and doctor's degrees conferred in 1992, we find that
women earned 75% of the advanced degrees in education, 65% in English
literature, and 63% in ethnic and cultural studies. Men earned 85% of the
advanced degrees in engineering, 75% in physical sciences and science
technologies, and 60% in mathematics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As of 1990, women held 73% of all college degrees in education, 61% of
degrees in liberal arts and humanities, and 81% of degrees in nursing and
pharmacy. Men held 91% of degrees in engineering, 74% in physical and earth
sciences, and 67% of degrees in mathematics and statistics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All professions have costs and benefits, pluses and minuses. Investment
bankers make more money than school teachers, but teachers have frequent
and much longer vacations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proper role of government is to provide equal protection of the laws
and opportunity, not preferential treatment based on warped social theory,
especially when that theory is so demonstrably false.

<title>Schlafly: Games and Tricks of the New World Order  -- 2/22/96</title>

<h2>
Games and Tricks of the New World Order
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
It's becoming clear that "New World Order" is not just a fantasy of 
conspiracy-minded rightwingers. President George Bush popularized its use 
in 1990 in order to legitimize the Gulf War by resuscitating the 
then-moribund United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like Saddam Hussein, the New World Order concept survived the Gulf War 
intact, and now we're seeing the unintended consequences. New World Order 
is a handy label to describe the various policies that are challenging our 
sovereignty, trying to bore into our bank account, and turning over U.S. 
service personnel to the U.N. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The World Trade Organization (WTO), which the United States officially 
joined when Congress ratified the GATT treaty in its lame-duck session in 
December 1994, recently ruled against the United States in its first case. 
Why is anybody surprised! This result was widely predicted. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The adverse WTO ruling is embarrassing to President Clinton and his U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who had promised the liberals that the 
WTO would never diminish our environmental regulations. It's just as 
embarrassing to the Republican leadership in Congress who promised 
conservatives that such an attack on our sovereign right to make our own 
laws would never happen. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At issue was the Clean Air Act's strict limits on pollutants in gasoline, 
which Venezuela and Brazil were unable to meet. In the name of "free 
trade," they took their complaint to the WTO and won. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela or Brazil, in 
the name of "free trade" the WTO can now order "cross- retaliation" trade 
sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to the 
gasoline industry or the EPA regulations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It was the 1994 GATT treaty that made this adverse ruling and unfair 
punishment possible. The old GATT did not allow it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The second New World Order item is the announcement by UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in London that he wants to finance the nearly 
bankrupt United Nations by imposing a global tax on foreign exchange 
transactions. A tiny rate of 0.5 percent would produce an incredible $1.5 
trillion, while a minuscule rate of 0.05 percent would produce $150 
billion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another global tax he is toying with that would produce billions of dollars 
is a surcharge of $1.50 on all international airline tickets. It turns out 
that one of the chief promoters of these far-out notions is the 
Clinton-appointed administrator of the UN Development Program, James 
Gustave Speth. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some claim that Boutros-Ghali is floating the global tax in order to shame 
the United States into paying the $1.4 billion the U.N. claims we owe. Some 
are suggesting that, if we don't pay up, the U.N. should cut off our U.N. 
voting rights, hit us with late- payment charges, and impose a ban on 
hiring U.S. citizens for U.N. jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Americans don't think they are getting their money's worth from our 
payments to the U.N. Our assessments are 25 percent of the regular U.N. 
budget and 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The third New World Order item is the court-martial and conviction of an 
American soldier, Army Specialist Michael New, for refusing to wear the UN 
uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping" expedition to Macedonia. The other 
550 servicemen in his unit donned UN helmets, replaced their U.S. I.D. card 
with a U.N. I.D. card, and dutifully marched off to Macedonia, where 
Americans have no business being in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When Specialist New's commander gave the U.N.-uniform order to the 550 
troops on October 2, 1995 in Schweinfurt, Germany, the only authority he 
cited consisted of "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN 
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security Council 
Resolutions." He mocked objections to the U.N. baby-blue helmets by saying, 
"They look fabulous." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, the baby-blue UN helmets don't look either military or masculine. 
Maybe that's why they have been seen only very fleetingly on American 
television. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
New argued that the order to alter his uniform was a violation of the 
Army's regulation against wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, 
medal or uniform. He said, "I am not a U.N. soldier. I am an American 
soldier." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
You have to wonder why the Clinton Administration didn't simply reassign 
New to some other duty, since the twice-decorated soldier has an exemplary 
record and was willing to obey any order to go anywhere in the world so 
long as he could wear a U.S. uniform. But no, Clinton was determined to 
carry out this first step in transforming American soldiers into U.N. 
soldiers and wouldn't let one soldier stand in his way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) calls Specialist New an American hero 
and has been joined by at least 60 other Congressmen in co- sponsoring a 
bill to declare it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services 
to wear insignia, indicia or headgear indicating any allegiance to or 
affiliation with the United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All the Republican Presidential candidates should be addressing these New 
World Order issues.

<h2>
 Buchanan Knows Where the Votes Are
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The Inside the Beltway pundits and others who think they are movers and
shakers of the establishment are wracking their brains to try to figure out
why Pat Buchanan has such an enthusiastic following. His social
conservatism is part of the reason, but there is another part they don't
understand.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The day after the Iowa caucuses, I received a subscription appeal from the
Wall Street Journal. Let me share it with you.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On a beautiful late spring afternoon, 25 years ago, two young men
graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young
men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable, and
both were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They
were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three
children. Both had gone to work for the same midwestern manufacturing
company after graduation, and were still there.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The letter's sales talk conveyed the impression (although it didn't say so)
that the difference between the one man's mediocre job and the other man's
rise to the top was that he had the benefit of the information in the Wall
Street Journal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president of the company reads the Wall Street Journal for all the
business news he needs on technology, competition and marketing around the
world. He can track his investments on easy-to-scan market quotations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal speaks to and for those successful businessmen, and
it should. Entrepreneurs are great people; they make America prosperous by
investing their savings in plant expansion and in creating new jobs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be that the guy who didn't rise any higher than middle management,
or who is a blue-collar worker, had less smarts or opportunity or energy or
perseverance, but he is an American, too, and he expected to share in the
American dream of a rising standard of living. But his real wages haven't
risen in ten years, and now he lives in fear and dread of losing his job
altogether if his manufacturing plant is relocated overseas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are tens of thousands more of these guys than there are of the
bosses. The Wall Street Journal doesn't speak for them, but Pat Buchanan
does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, he is the only presidential candidate of either party who speaks
for them (Bill Clinton, who never had any contact with real life in the
working world, is bragging about the rise in the stock market), and that's
why Buchanan's campaign is rising like a rocket. He is changing the
Republican Party from Wall Street to Main Street.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the Iowa caucuses, the other presidential candidates never appeared
to care about or want this immense constituency of working Americans.
Chanting the mantra "free trade,'' their attitude toward displaced workers
was, "Tough! That's the breaks in a free market. We live in a global
economy, and you need to look for another job.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The other Presidential candidates, as well as the Republican leadership in
Congress, all backed Clinton on NAFTA, GATT, the Mexican bailout, and
sending American troops to Bosnia. It is ridiculous to think that any
Republican who agrees with Bill Clinton on those gut issues about jobs and
American sovereignty can defeat him in November.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whoever advised the 
Republican leadership in Congress to make "a balanced
budget in seven years with CBO numbers'' and government- regulated HMOs for
Medicare the 1995-96 Republican legislative goals must have been a
double-agent for Bill Clinton. The former is unintelligible to the voters
and the latter is unacceptable to seniors, so adopting those as goals
served up an immense public relations victory to Clinton.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal and conservative publications that like to give
advice to Republicans are saying that the Party must "integrate the views''
of the two blocs in the conservative movement, the social and the economic
(a.k.a. the balanced budget bloc). They have it all wrong; the balanced
budget is irrelevant at the grass roots.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To win against Clinton, the Republican candidate must get the votes of the
Reagan Democrats, those pro-life, pro-family, working-class Democrats who
voted for Reagan, whom George Bush kicked away. To win against Clinton, the
Republican candidate must get the votes of the Perot voters, the
independent voters who oppose NAFTA and GATT and favor term limits and
campaign reform.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The conservative publications that supported NAFTA, GATT, the failed
balanced-budget strategy, and Clinton-lite health care "reform,'' feel
threatened by Buchanan's success. That's why they have started a campaign
of invective and epithets on a scale unseen in American politics since the
Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Bob Dole got to New Hampshire, he ran negative TV ads attacking
Buchanan at the same time that he adopted Buchanan's winning rhetoric when
talking to the voters. Dole attacked the reduction in real average hourly
wages and tax increases on family income and said, "Corporate profits are
setting records and so are corporate layoffs.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Buchanan knows where the votes are. The others are just starting to find
out, but they are hopelessly compromised by their long record of supporting
Clinton's disastrous foreign and domestic policies.

<h2>
Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The theater of the presidential primaries is tending to obscure the fact 
that the fight is already on in earnest for control of the next Congress. 
The victory of a liberal Democrat for U.S. Senator from Oregon to fill the 
seat vacated by Bob Packwood may prove anew the truth of the old adage that 
&quot;Coming events cast their shadows before them.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political director of the AFL-CIO bragged that his union had sent 37 
full-time campaign workers to Oregon to work for Democrat Ron Wyden and to 
attack the Republican on key issues such as Medicare. The union made more 
than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more than 350,000 pieces of mail on 
behalf of the Democratic candidate. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't just the AFL-CIO. At least eleven other individual unions joined 
forces to bring in $183,000 in political action committee donations. That 
made a mighty big presence in one targeted campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
PAC spending is only part of what the unions are doing in Congressional 
races. The unions' phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and 
grassroots organizing are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than 
the direct donations reported to the Federal Election Committee. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of this union politicking is financed through mandatory worker dues, 
and much is unreported and unregulated by federal election laws. To use a 
favorite political metaphor, union support is a ten-ton gorilla in 
Congressional elections. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Oregon race is the start of a massive campaign to use leftwing, liberal 
political muscle in targeted races in order to undo the Republican 
victories of 1994. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has announced plans to spend $35 million to defeat 75 
Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections. This is seven times 
more than the union usually spends in federal elections and does not even 
include the millions more spent by individual unions, or the so-called 
&quot;soft money&quot; and the &quot;volunteer&quot; political campaigning done by union 
members. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unions have suffered many years of declining influence. John Sweeney 
won election as AFL-CIO President last year by promising not only an 
aggressive campaign to increase union membership, but also a vocal 
political campaign to promote the union's liberal agenda. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association (NEA), one of the most powerful of all 
the individual unions, has targeted 42 Republican Congressmen for defeat. 
According to the NEA's own press release, the NEA will run &quot;a grassroots 
organizing drive&quot; and a media ad campaign accusing these Congressmen of 
&quot;cutting off our children's future.&quot; 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NEA has already spent $4.75 million on a multi-media ad campaign 
designed to scare voters about Medicare and Goals 2000 reductions. This 
lavish campaign was targeted in 55 Congressional districts and included 
press conferences, leafleting, and phone banks. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's unfortunate that Congress, by a slight margin, failed to abolish the 
preferential property tax exemption enjoyed exclusively by the National 
Education Association. No other union has this unique financial advantage. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The polls indicate that the public is blaming the Republican Congress for 
not getting much of anything done last year. In fact, President Clinton 
deserves most of the blame because he vetoed a perfectly reasonable 
Balanced Budget Act and also a perfectly reasonable compromise welfare 
reform bill. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The members of Congress most at risk from the AFL-CIO assault are the 
freshmen who came to Washington determined to cut government down to size. 
They are our hope for a conservative Congress in the future. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is a freshman Congressman who is leading the battle to abolish the 
Department of Education. It is a freshman Congressman who is championing 
the cause of the brave U.S. soldier (Michael New) who refused to wear a 
United Nations uniform. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was a freshman Congressman who dared to push for a vote on the Mexican 
bailout. It was a freshman Congressman who stopped the totalitarian 
anti-terrorism bill (to give Janet Reno the power to wiretap all our 
telephones.) 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was freshmen Congressmen who voted against Clinton's unconstitutional 
sending of U.S. troops into the war in Bosnia. It is freshmen Congressmen 
who are working for campaign spending reform and term limits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are the Congressmen you will hear the media complaining about as 
&quot;obstructionists&quot; and &quot;extremists.&quot; That's because they are daring to 
challenge business as usual and have a real dedication to doing what the 
voters sent them to Washington to do. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can bet that the freshmen members of Congress will be the ones targeted 
for defeat by the big money and organizational muscle of the liberal 
unions.

<title>Schlafly: The Great Awakening About Jobs -- 3/14/96</title>

<h2>
The Great Awakening About Jobs
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
When Bob Dole said in New Hampshire, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade 
and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days 
of this campaign," he revealed the cloistered mindset of government 
officials who have relative job security backed up by a golden parachute. 
Now, the New York Times has had a similar epiphany, reporting the same 
discovery to its readers in a five-newspaper-page article starting with 
five columns on the front page. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To most families across America, it's old news that jobs are the premier 
issue. The media only discovered it when it became a factor in the 
presidential campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Times now admits that nearly three quarters of all households have had 
a close encounter with layoffs since 1980. One-third of American households 
have had a family member who lost a job, and another 40 percent know a 
relative, friend or neighbor who was laid off. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Doesn't it strike you as remarkable that the elite press is just 
discovering something that is an issue with three-fourths of American 
families? Maybe the media were just snowed by President Clinton's bragging 
in his State of the Union Message that our economy is "the healthiest it 
has been in three decades." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, newspaper headlines have been spelling out the news for several 
years: 123,000 laid off by AT&T, 18,800 by Delta Airlines, 16,800 by 
Eastman Kodak, 50,000 by Sears, 20,000 by DEC. It isn't just blue-collar 
manufacturing jobs that are disappearing, it's white-collar and 
middle-management jobs, too. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In an earlier generation, most people who were laid off found jobs that 
paid roughly as well as their old jobs. That doesn't happen, now. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Prior to the New Hampshire primary, the attitude of most presidential 
wannabes, politicians, pundits had been to recite the mantras "Free trade 
is wonderful; we have to complete in a global economy; and get yourself 
retrained for a new job." It's now clear that competing in a global economy 
does not improve our quality of life in America but lowers it, and buying a 
cheaper computer can't compensate for losing your job. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The politicians have been saying that the answer to layoffs, as well as to 
the fact that the median wage in America today, adjusted for inflation, is 
nearly three percent below what it was in 1979, is "training and 
education." That's become a code word for creating more taxpayer-financed 
"job-training" programs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But many of the victims of large layoffs are fully educated and trained. 
The majority of those laid off have at least some college education. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Lockheed, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas have been laying off aerospace 
engineers. IBM, Compaq and Apple have been laying off systems analysts and 
software programmers. The automobile industry has been laying off skilled 
machine tool operators and automotive engineers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of these men and women will never find another job in their area of 
expertise or at anywhere near their past salaries. If education and 
re-training are the answer, what should they be trained for? Half of those 
who received Ph.D.'s in mathematics last year did not find fulltime 
employment within a year of graduation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And, if these educated workers cannot find meaningful re- employment in 
their industries, prospects are even bleaker for blue-collar workers and 
others without marketable skills. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition to the financial setback, there is an enormous human cost of 
layoffs when there is no prospect of a new job anything on a par with the 
old one. This includes acute humiliation in front of your loved ones and 
friends, marriage breakup, withdrawal from volunteer community service, and 
being uprooted from your home town and forced to move elsewhere. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Technological progress is the cause of many of these layoffs. Of course, we 
have to progress from horse and buggies to automobiles, from kerosine lamps 
to electric appliances, and from typewriters and carbon paper to computers 
and copy machines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But more and more people have realized that another major cause of this 
disruption and downsizing is the incessant and orchestrated demand that 
America compete in a global economy with hundreds of millions of unemployed 
and under-employed people around the world who are willing to work for 25 
cents an hour. That's what "free trade" means, and there's nothing fair 
about it.

<title>Schlafly: Political Slush Funds -- 3/21/96</title>

<h2>
Political Slush Funds
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The media are persistently presenting us with reports that voters are 
"angry," usually with the implication that this condition is the voters' 
fault and is some kind of a national problem like a social disease. The 
Heritage Foundation, in a document called "Top Ten Political Slush Funds," 
has now given us chapter and verse to justify plenty of anger on the part 
of the voters. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Heritage document sets forth dozens upon dozens of private groups that 
are on the federal dole for millions of dollars of our taxpayers' money, 
part of which they use to lobby and politic for their own special-interest 
causes. Just to call the roll makes anybody angry at the way Congress, over 
the years of one-party Democratic rule, has extorted our hard-earned money 
through income taxes and distributed it among their liberal friends. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Efforts to restrict this welfare for lobbyists last year through the 
Istook-McIntosh Amendment were drowned under the hysterical lobbying of 
these corporate welfare recipients. Their advocacy of bigger government, 
higher spending, and increased government regulation has continued 
unabated. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has been giving away our 
money for many years to a long list of liberal and feminist outfits, of 
which the most egregious was NEH Chair Lynne Cheney's $2 million grant to 
UCLA that produced the notorious leftwing revisionist National History 
Standards. The NEH has given other taxpayer grants to such special-interest 
groups as the American Bar Association, the American Library Association, 
and the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The current NEH Chair, Sheldon Hackney, has started a stream of tax dollars 
flowing to something called "National Conversation." Only an ivory-tower 
liberal could, with a straight face, argue that Americans need federal 
funding and intervention in order to engage in "conversation," so you can 
bet in what political direction this conversation will be led. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Market Promotion Program gives taxpayer handouts to trade organizations 
to advertise U.S. products in foreign countries. Of course, parts of their 
grants are used to lobby against reductions in agricultural subsidies, all the while they are mouthing the mantra "free trade." 
Here is a tiny sampling of these taxpayer grants: $7 million to the Meat 
Export Federation, $6 million to Cotton Council International, $5 million 
each to the Poultry and Egg Export Council and to the Wine Institute, $4 
million to Florida Citrus, $3 million to the California Almond Board, $2 
million each to the Pillsbury Company and the Mink Export Council. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funnels 400 million federal tax 
dollars to 323 private groups around the country, most of which engage in 
political and lobbying activities. These tax-paid lawyers file lawsuits, 
engage in political advocacy, and work in referendum campaigns to prevent 
welfare reform, to promote racial preferences, to provide tax benefits to 
illegal immigrants and felons, and even to prevent the eviction of drug 
dealers from public housing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The taxpayers are forced to fund Planned Parenthood to the tune of at least 
$189 million. Much of this money goes in direct grants to state chapters of 
Planned Parenthood that typically deal with abortion and engage in 
legislative and political advocacy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Numerous liberal lobbying organizations that pretend to advocate the 
interests of seniors have figured out to get themselves on the dole for 
large amounts of taxpayers money. These include $69 million to American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), $61 million to the National Council 
of Senior Citizens, and $38 million to the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
AARP is one of the country's largest and wealthiest private lobbying 
organizations and doesn't need tax-funded charity. It lobbied actively for 
Clinton's socialized health care bill in 1994, even though AARP's internal 
surveys showed that most seniors opposed it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Grants to an endless list of private organizations are concealed in the 
fine print of the federal budget under such high sounding titles as Senior 
Environmental Employment Program ($45 million), Superfund Worker Training 
Program ($32 million), HHS Discretionary Aging Projects ($26 million), and 
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance ($25 million). 
These political slush funds include handouts to some of the richest 
advocacy organizations in the country, including the American Bar 
Association and the American Medical Association. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some of the wealthiest national unions are on the gravy train, too. The 
Laborers Union gets $8 million, the Carpenters $4 million, the Chemical 
Workers $3 million, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers $3 million, the 
Operating Engineers and the Teamsters each get $2 million, and the Auto 
Workers $1 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Americans are tired of hearing talk about the goal of "a balanced budget in 
seven years," and tired of the bleeding-heart Democratic rhetoric 
complaining that "budget cuts hurt seniors and children." It is an outrage 
that Congress has failed to eliminate all welfare to private advocacy 
groups of all kinds.

<h2>
Why Do They Call It "Free Trade"?
</h2>

<P>
Why do some people persist in mouthing the mantra "free trade" when foreign 
countries can and do engage in all sorts of dishonest tactics that 
interfere with trade, such as devaluation or other manipulation of the 
value of their money, confiscation (or nationalization) of U.S. property, 
refusing to live up to the contracts and agreements they sign, stealing our 
patents and copyrights, and counterfeiting our money? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Chinese government is engaging in massive piracy of American patented, 
copyrighted and trademarked materials. The U.S. intellectual property 
stolen by the Chinese includes a wide array of products including computer 
programs, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, musical recordings, 
videos, and automotive designs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Collectively, these products are one of the greatest strengths of the U.S. 
economy and are the envy of the world. The United States exports many 
billions of dollars worth of these products each year. China simply finds 
it easier to illegally copy these products than to buy them from us or 
build competitive products, so China steals them on a gigantic scale. Some 
30 Chinese factories daily turn out thousands of illegal compact discs and 
sell them all over the world, and illegally copied recordings, films and 
computer programs are widely available all over China. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Experts estimate that China's piracy in intellectual property amounts to $1 
billion per year in lost U.S. exports. According to the Commerce 
Departments rule-of-thumb, this means that 20,000 American jobs have been 
displaced by the $1 billion in lost U.S. exports. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just a year ago, U.S. and Chinese negotiators signed a second agreement to 
end this piracy of intellectual property, but these agreements have had no 
effect on the Chinese. China has failed to comply with every major trade 
agreement it has signed with the United States in recent years. The United 
States has threatened China with trade sanctions a half-dozen times, but 
such threats have no effect on China's stealing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
McDonnell Douglas's dealings with the Communist Chinese offer a good 
example of how they deceive American businessmen in order to steal U.S. 
technology and equipment. By dangling the prospect of a large order for 
passenger planes which was later largely cancelled, the Chinese acquired at 
bargain-basement prices a tremendous quantity of U.S. equipment that is 
building up Chinese military power to threaten other countries. China is 
even sharing our technology with Iran. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office told Congress on February 27 that Middle East 
counterfeiters are flooding overseas markets with "the highest quality of 
counterfeit $100 U.S. bills Treasury officials have ever seen." Our 
government is sure that a foreign government supports the printers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This situation is not new. The House Republican Research Committee's Task 
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare declared four years ago that 
billions of "superdollars" are being produced on "high-tech, state-owned 
presses with paper only acquired by governments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On March 2, U.S. negotiator Ira Shapiro said that Japan has failed to carry 
out an agreement it signed in October 1994 to open up its insurance market 
to us. Shapiro said that other areas where Japan remains unwilling to open 
its markets are semiconductors, photographic film, and civil aviation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Foreign countries impose all kinds of tariffs as well as an endless variety 
of tariff- alternatives, such as limiting the number and kinds of U.S. 
products that may enter their country and forcing U.S. products to meet 
unreasonable requirements. Just ask any of the many companies that have 
tried to sell their products in Japan and have run into one bureaucratic or 
regulatory roadblock after another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many foreign countries have governments that are totally corrupt. 
Corruption and bribery are accepted ways of doing business in many foreign 
countries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Far from being the "free trade" that the NAFTA and GATT treaties promised, 
they have subjected the American economy to new international 
bureaucracies. After Sprint closed a telemarketing plant in San Francisco 
because it was losing money, it not only faced a challenge from the union, 
but on February 27 was subjected to a NAFTA challenge from tri-national 
representatives of Mexico, Canada and the United States. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is dishonest to eliminate U.S. tariffs and call it "free trade" when any 
or all of the above tactics are used against us. We are fools to seek "free 
trade" with countries that engage in organized theft of our property and 
counterfeiting of our money, or which renege on their agreements and 
contracts. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the Clinton Administration calls NAFTA and GATT "free trade," we 
should remember that those were the same people who called taxes 
"contributions," and who called government social spending "investments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But aren't low-tariffs or no-tariffs a good thing? That depends -- on the 
industry, on the source country, on the timing, on the reciprocity. Tariffs 
should be individually determined, and all tariff-alternatives and other 
government restrictions used by other countries should be on the table 
during the negotiations. The guiding principle should be the overall best 
interests of the American people -- not the rulings of foreign bureaucrats.

<h2>
Reading, Writing, 'Rithmetic, and Ritalin
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Can it be a disease if no X-ray, CT scan, blood test, laboratory 
analysis, MRI, or any other medical test can confirm its existence?  
Can it be a disease if diagnosis can be made by anon-physician 
checking any 8 of 14 items on a behavior checklist such as 
inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, or short attention span?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, an estimated two million children (three times as many boys as 
girls) have been labeled with this disease and are taking a powerful 
drug to treat it.  That's four times as many as in 1990.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The disease is Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the most widely used drug to treat 
it is methylphenidate, known as Ritalin.  A powerful stimulant, it 
juices up the central nervous system, takes effect in 30 minutes, and 
peters out in three to four hours.  Ritalin is classified as a 
Schedule II controlled substance in the same category as cocaine, 
methadone and methamphetamine.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be coincidence, but in 1991 the U.S. Department of Education 
formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation 
Act.  After the Department directed all state education officers to 
ensure that local school districts establish procedures to screen and 
identify ADHD children and give them special educational and 
psychological services, generous funding suddenly began to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public schools have learned how to tap into free-flowing federal funds 
from Medicaid.  Letters sent home to parents brag that the schools 
"will use this new revenue to add more services for children who 
require specialized health care, social services, mental health care, 
speech therapy, counseling, and psychological services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Capital Research Center has exposed how Goals 2000 is used as a 
cover to authorize programs in health care and create a system in 
which children selected by teachers are regularly tested for 
emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders (such as ADD and 
ADHD) in clinics inside the public schools.  Once children are 
diagnosed and labeled with one of these conditions, school health 
officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing and 
administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam and 
Prozac.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Schools are starting to administer medical treatment to children under 
new, looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation initiatives.  These new rules allow nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, 
Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health (Title X) blockgrants, state 
programs, and private foundations.  Private foundations and government 
agencies have teamed up to develop, coordinate and support a variety 
of public school systems to govern the health and behavior of 
children, sometimes under the name Children's Initiative.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A Pittsburgh-based foundation that will not allow its name to be 
disclosed provided grants for two projects named "Pharmacological and 
Psychosocial Treatment of ADHD" and "Community-Based Treatment for 
ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide Interventions" to be 
operated by the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School 
District in Pennsylvania.  The grant funds were matched by taxpayers' 
money from the federal National Institutes of Mental Health.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One portion of this project, called the "Pittsburgh School Wide 
Intervention Model," uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which 
children are asked to answer a lot of nosy questions about the other 
kids in their class, such as who they do not want to befriends with.  
The children are instructed not to discuss the questions and answers 
with anyone else.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education 
Programs, under contract HS 92017001, gave the Chesapeake Institute of 
Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two slick videos:  "Facing the 
Challenges of ADD" featuring actress Rita Moreno, and "One Child in 
Every Classroom" with Frank Sesno as moderator.  Parts of the videos 
sound like an infomercial for Ritalin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a PBS documentary following eight months of investigation, a 
Department of Education spokesman was asked if he was aware that the 
parents who spoke so enthusiastically about Ritalin on the videos were 
board members of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder 
(CHADD), and if he knew that CHADD has received cash grants of 
$900,000 plus in-kind services from Ciba-Geigy, the manufacturer of 
Ritalin.  Obviously embarrassed, the bureaucrat denied such knowledge.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's clear that the Department of Education does not adhere to 
professional standards of disclosure.  When anything is published in 
the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, the 
author must sign a statement in which he reveals "any affiliations 
with or financial involvement in any organization or entity with a 
direct financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed 
in the manuscript."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
John Merrow, executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that 
Ritalin is so plentiful that a black market has developed on the 
school playground.  Ritalin can be crushed and snorted for a cheap and 
modest buzz, and it has become a "gateway drug" in junior high school, 
the first drug a child experiments with.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Parents of a child who is diagnosed, labeled, or treated by school-
paid personnel would be well-advised to seek an independent, unbiased 
medical opinion.

<h2>
The Dumbing Down Of America's Colleges 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>
<P>
The 1996 Governors Education Summit at Palisades, New York, spent 
two days discussing &quot;standards&quot; for what students should learn in 
public schools.  Longtime American Federation of Teachers 
president Al Shanker gave this concept a reality check. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
He said, when as a teacher he assigned homework to his class, the 
pupils invariably responded in chorus, &quot;Does it count on our 
grade?&quot;  He pointed out that standards aren't going to make any 
difference if, no matter what students learn or don't learn, they 
can still get admitted to nearly all U.S. colleges and 
universities. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The National Association of Scholars (NAS), the nation's leading 
higher-education reform organization, has just published a 
devastating 65-page report on the dumbing down of the 50 top 
undergraduate colleges and universities.  The NAS used U.S. 
News & World Report's annual listing of &quot;America's Best 
Colleges&quot; (including both private and public) and compared the 
years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The NAS concludes that students no longer learn the common core 
of knowledge once taken for granted as essential to a liberal- 
arts education.  The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that formerly taught 
students the historical, cultural, political and scientific 
basics of our society. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses has been dramatically reduced 
from an average of 9.9 in 1914, to 7.3 in 1939, to 6.9 in 1964, 
and to 2.5 in 1993.  The formerly universal requirement that 
students take a basic survey course in several important areas 
has virtually vanished. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Universities now offer very few courses that require 
prerequisites, which means that very few college courses now 
require any advance knowledge or preparation.  In 1914, 
universities offered an average of only 23 courses per 
institution that did not require a prerequisite course; in 1964 
the figure had risen to 127; today, the number is 582. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 12 percent of universities now require a thesis or 
comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree.  As late as 
1964, more than half of universities did. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The college year has been shortened by about one-fourth (leaving 
more time for spring break and other frivolities, but, of course, 
without any reduction in tuition price or professors' salaries).  
In 1914, college classes were in session an average of 204 days a 
year; by 1939 the number had dropped to 195; in 1964, to 191; and 
today students and teachers are expected to show up in class only 
156 days per academic year. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why young people can't write good English is 
that so few colleges teach writing any more.  In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; by 1964 
the figure was 86 percent; today, it's only 36 percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ditto for math.  In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; by 1964 only 36 percent 
did; now, only 12 percent do.  In 1914, 1939 and 1964, more than 
70 percent of the institutions required at least one course in 
the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 34 
percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why the taxpayer-financed federal guidelines on 
the teaching of American history turned out to be such a travesty 
was that most college graduates haven't studied any history.  In 
1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required history; in 1939 
and 1964 more than 50 percent did; but now only one of the 50 
schools has a required history course. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the 
institutions in 1914, and at 50 percent in 1939 and 1964.  Today, 
not one of the &quotbest&quot; institutions has a literature requirement. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has increased by a factor of five since 1914, and 
has doubled since 1964, but that doesn't offer more opportunities 
to become an educated citizen.  The majority of these additional 
courses are on narrow and idiosyncratic subjects of interest to 
the professors but almost worthless to the students. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many courses are not college courses at all; they are designed to 
teach students what they didn't learn in high school.  Sometimes 
these courses are called &quot;remedial,&quot; but the institutions prefer 
euphemisms such as &quot;second tier&quot; and &quot;sub-freshman.&quot;
Unheard of prior to 1939, today such non-college courses are offered in 70 
percent of the elite universities, and most of them award college 
credit. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California state legislators have recently discovered the high 
cost to the taxpayers of the remedial education courses given at 
the state universities.  Last year, 60 percent of new students 
needed remedial help. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California legislators assert that students have been the victims 
of consumer fraud perpetrated on them by the high schools that 
gave them high grades.  The legislators want to send the invoice 
for the cost of the remedial courses to the high schools that 
deceived their students by giving them a 3.8 or higher grade- 
point average. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NAS concludes that our best colleges and universities no 
longer turn out graduates who have even an elementary knowledge 
of our civilization and its heritage.  They do not learn the 
basic facts of our country's history, political and economic 
systems, philosophic traditions, and literary and artistic 
legacies, and the result is that we are in danger of losing the 
national cohesion of a known and shared American heritage.

<title>Schlafly: MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue  -- 4/18/96</title>

<h2>
MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
What are Republicans going to do about the top election-year issue, 
which is jobs, wages and income?  Real (inflation-adjusted) weekly 
wages have dropped almost 5 percent since 1979.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Business spokesmen are trying to downplay this data by arguing that 
employee fringe benefits have risen from 17 percent of total 
compensation in 1955 to 40 percent in 1994.  Total compensation equals 
take-home pay plus fringe benefits, of which health care is a large 
component.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Workers aren't buying this argument because, while the employer's cost 
to provide the health-care benefit has risen, the value of the health 
care benefit to the employee has declined.  Whereas in 1979, the 
employee's health-care package allowed him to go to any doctor or 
hospital of his choice, now employees are being herded into HMOs where 
they are at the mercy of gatekeepers.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
HMOs suffer from a built-in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and 
the CEOs make more money if they deny your right to see a specialist.  
That's why opposition to the tactics of the HMOs,and to the windfall 
profits these tactics produce for CEOs and stockholders, is bubbling 
over, and an anti-managed care march is planned for Washington in May.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to these problems, if 
they will only use it.  It could put extra money in the pockets of 
workers whose real wages have declined, and it could ease the strain 
of downsizing by allowing them to take some of their benefits with 
them when they leave the company.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This solution is Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), which most House 
Republicans campaigned on in 1994.  The Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, which Clinton 
vetoed; and then the House passed it again in its health care reform 
bill, now pending.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But President Clinton and the Washington press corps are trying to 
bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich Congress into passing the Kennedy-
Kassebaum bill without MSAs, which would take us a long way into the 
Clintoncare system we thought we had buried in 1994.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care:  the high cost, preserving your right to 
choose your own doctor, portability, pre-existing conditions, job 
lock, uninsured Americans, gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-
payments, paperwork, long-term care, Medicare going bankrupt, and even 
the decline in real wages. Here is how MSAs would work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who are in a company plan, the employer would buy you a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pay your deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
your individual Medical Savings Account.  You can use this ready cash 
for your medical costs with the doctors, hospitals and clinics you 
choose, and the high-deductible policy covers you for additional 
expenses.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You would own your own MSA (just as you now own your automobile 
insurance).  That means you can take it with you when you change jobs, 
thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing conditions, and 
job lock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What if you are self-employed, a part-timer, or are not in an 
employer-paid health plan?  In those cases, you can set up your MSA 
and your high-deductible policy with your own money.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans.  Our present 
system is unjust, unfair and intolerable because it grants tax-
deductibility only to plans owned by employers, but not to plans that 
allow individual employees to own their own health insurance, control 
their own health care spending, or set up their own plan.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is probably the most discriminatory feature of the entire federal 
legal system.  The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-plated 
health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
waitress, the part-timers and the self-employed can buy health 
insurance only with after-tax dollars (which means it costs double).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The sweetest part of MSAs is that whatever you don't spend will stay 
in your MSA and build up as a tax-free, interest-bearing savings 
account (only 11 percent of all insured individual Americans spend 
more than $2,000 a year on health care).  That will bring down health 
care costs dramatically because MSAs will put consumer discipline into 
the marketplace and provide incentives to save.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Your MSA will grow as you or your employer puts in a new payment every 
year.  MSAs will be available now and in the future for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans (such as eye glasses, 
dental care, or preventive care) or by Medicare (prescriptions and 
long-term care).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should reject the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, ignore the HMO 
lobbyists, and instead give workers the MSAs that the Republican 
majority in Congress promised.

<h2>
The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
 
 
We've heard a lot about Republican plans to return power to the states. 
Bob Dole, in his stump speech, ostentatiously pulls a copy of the Tenth 
Amendment from his pocket, reminding us about the powers that are 
"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing in the Tenth Amendment, however, authorizes the devolution of 
power to the Governors of the various states. Yet, under the bipartisan 
education bills now moving through Congress, the Federal Government 
would collect taxes, issue new federal regulations about the public 
schools (an area that should be "reserved to the states"), and then 
give the money and the power to the Governors, bypassing state 
legislatures altogether.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This massive legislation, which seeks to restructure public schools 
throughout all 50 states, builds on the Goals 2000 Act and the School-
to-Work Act, both passed in 1994 and signed by President Clinton. 
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last September by 
a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S.143 (the Workforce Development 
Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One might think that such large majorities would mean that the bills 
are not controversial. Actually they've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Speaker Gingrich has just received a letter signed by 63 Republican 
members of the Missouri House objecting to the fact that H.R.1617 
"centralizes unprecedented powers at the federal level" and "supersedes 
state laws and further takes us, the local elected officials of the 
people of this state, out of the process of education." These 
legislators specifically object to the way that the CAREERS act "amends 
out the state legislature, replacing it with the Governor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since Missouri has a liberal Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, it's 
easy to see why Republican legislators think this is a very bad idea. A 
similar letter was signed by 13 Republican Missouri State Senators.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The letter from the 63 Missouri State Representatives asserts that 
"this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and flies in 
the face of the principle of local control of education."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Missouri letter also describes the devious additional ways that 
real power over school curriculum is being gathered into the hands of 
unelected bureaucrats, bypassing all elected officials such as state 
legislators and school boards. This is accomplished through the grant 
application which each Governor must submit in order to access federal 
money under the 1994 laws, as well as under the new legislation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These grant applications bind the states to conform to "standards" and 
"assessments" that are written by unelected federal or state 
bureaucrats and over which no elected representative or parent had any 
authority. In addition, the grant applications bind the states to spend 
money that the legislature had not appropriated.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Republican Congressmen who voted for H.R.1617 have made a strenuous 
effort to allay the fears of their constituents by asserting that these 
are "Republican" bills. That's not true.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that the Senate bill was largely written by a Senator Ted 
Kennedy staffer, the late Steve Spinner, who worked on it for three 
years. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, both Kennedy and Senator Nancy 
Kassebaum paid tribute to Spinner as the principal author of the bill 
and of the whole concept of using the public schools to carry out "work 
force education and employment functions" and turn schools into "a 
comprehensive one-stop delivery system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The micromanaging of public school curricula that will be exercised by 
the federal bureaucrats is evident from a letter in which the U.S. 
Departments of Labor and Education rejected the State of California's 
grant application for funds from the School to Work Law. The letter 
charged that California showed "a lack of systemic methods within the 
State to integrate vocational and academic curricula" and that 
California had failed to develop "Certificates for Foundations Skills 
and Career Entry."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A letter signed by 14 California State Senators called on Congress to 
"kill" H.R.1617. Among the many reasons cited were the awesome 
provision that would strike "a State" from certain federal laws and 
substitute "the Governor of the State," the extraordinary powers given 
to all Governors, and the setting up of a "National Electronic Data 
Base."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), who voted for the CAREERS bill last year, has 
changed his mind and recently circulated a "Dear Colleague" letter 
urging the repeal of Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act, as well as 
the defeat of H.R.1617 and S.143. He pointed out that they are all 
designed to implement the plan laid out in an 18-page letter written by 
Marc Tucker to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, to make 
schoolchildren "guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the 
global labor market."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is clear from the writings of Marc Tucker, Ira Magaziner, Hillary 
Clinton, Robert Reich, and the legislative history of H.R.1617 and 
S.143 that the goal is to transform public school curricula into 
specific workforce tracks determined by local workforce development 
boards. The proper name for this is National Economic Planning, a.k.a. 
Socialism, a system that has failed all over the world.

<title>THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center><i>July 7, 1995</i>
<hr>
<center></h2><b>The Legal Services Corporation Should be Abolished</b></h2></center>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the acid test to
demonstrate whether or not the new Republican majority really
intends to reform and reduce Big Government.  If the Republicans
merely play around with smoke and mirrors, pretending to correct
abuses, but leave the money faucet turned on, they will have
betrayed their mandate from the 1994 election and left their
enemies with a gun pointed at their head.
<p>
Budget leader Rep. John Kasich (R-OH) has scheduled LSC for
termination, except for some shut-down expenses.  Sen. Phil
Gramm (R-TX) is trying to get the Senate to agree. 
Unfortunately, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL) is working with the
Democrats to reauthorize (i.e., to save) LSC under the euphemism
of "reform."
<p>
The ideological incompatibility of the LSC with the new
Republican regime is indicated by the fact that Hillary Rodham
Clinton used to be its chairman of the board.  LSC has continued
to be peopled with leftist activists who share her class-warfare
ideology and socialist goals.  The record of LSC shows that it
functions not to provide services to the needy, but to serve as
a pot of gold for leftwing activists to litigate and lobby for
radical causes.
<p>
LSC has spent $5 billion since 1974.  If the leftwing lawyers
had merely torched the money, that wouldn't have been nearly as
destructive as spending the money the way they did.
<p>
In fact, they spent the money to litigate and lobby to increase
entitlements (for welfare, aliens, criminals, etc.) that are the
chief cause of federal deficits.  Howard Phillips, who has been
monitoring LSC since 1970 when President Nixon appointed him to
a position that included that responsibility, asserts that LSC
activism has added $2 trillion to the national debt.
<p>
The LSC lawyers have constructed for themselves such a
Byzantine, self-perpetuating infrastructure and grant-making
mechanism that they are accountable to no one:  not to Congress,
or to the Administration, or to the people they serve, or to the
taxpayers who foot the bills.
<p>
When most people think of legal aid services for the poor, they
think of helping victims, especially women and children. 
Instead, LSC works for such causes as preventing the eviction of
drug dealers from public housing, shielding violent offenders'
criminal records from the public, getting perks for prison
inmates, and releasing mental patients (who often then join the
ranks of the homeless).
<p>
When LSC lawyers talk about conducting "research" and
facilitating "training," they are using euphemisms for political
organizing and lobbying for pro-abortion, pro-gay rights,
pro-welfare entitlement, pro-criminal, pro-drug, and pro-illegal
alien causes.
<p>
LSC's litigation deserves a large share of the blame for the
out-of-control, failed welfare crisis we have today.  LSC
initiated the case, King v. Smith, in which the
Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the behavior of welfare
mothers, including cohabiting with wage-earning males, could not
be considered when determining eligibility for benefits.
<p>
In Shapiro v. Thompson in 1969, LSC got the Supreme Court to ban
the one-year residency requirement for welfare eligibility.  In
1970, in Goldberg v. Kelly, LSC persuaded the
Supreme Court to require a hearing process before benefits can
be cut off for any reason.  As a result, hardly anyone is ever
cut off.
<p>
The theory behind these cases, invented by LSC tax-funded
lawyers, is that welfare recipients have a property right in
their benefits, just like the rest of us have a property right
in our houses or automobiles.  This off-the-wall rationale has
become the cornerstone of the welfare rights movement, which has
changed our laws and picked the pockets of taxpayers.
<p>
Another favorite LSC constituency is incarcerated convicted
felons.  LSC's class action suit against the North Carolina
prison system resulted in a requirement that each of 13 prisons
provide softball and basketball equipment for two teams, a
piano, a set of drums, three guitars, and five frisbees. 
Another LSC victory was to establish Chicago prisoners' rights
to cable television and expensive weight rooms.
<p>
Other exotic LSC lawsuits included representing transsexuals in
an effort to overturn Georgia's prohibition on Medicaid
reimbursement for sex change operations, forcing public housing
officials to rent apartments to unemancipated minors, and trying
to define opium and alcohol addiction as a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
<p>
LSC's current president, Alexander Forger (best known as
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's lawyer), was questioned in April by
a Congressional committee about the imposition of certain
limitations on the way LSC funds are spent.  He impudently
replied:  "There is a legal case, if we choose to assert it,
that the [House] Committee does not have the authority to make
that decision."
<p>
Radical leftwing activism is part and parcel of LSC.  It is a
fraud on the public to pretend it can be reformed.  It must be
abolished.

<title>EDUCATION REFORM, TED KENNEDY-STYLE</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<center><h2>Education Reform, Ted Kennedy-Style</center></h2>
<p>

<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a> 
</center><hr><p>
<p>
Here's a multiple-choice question for you.  Will the new
conservative Republican majority in Congress 
<p>
(a) terminate federal functions for which there is no
constitutional authority, e.g., education; 
<p>
(b) reduce the size of government by abolishing agencies, e.g., the
Department of Education; 
<p>
(c) reduce the power of the Federal Government to micro-manage our
lives, e.g., stop mandating school curriculum; or 
<p>
(d) adopt a Ted Kennedy blueprint to manage individual behavior
from the schoolroom to the workplace?   
<p>
If you picked (d), you are on to the plan of the "moderate" House
Republicans to use the current momentum for education reform to put
America into the harness of National Economic Planning, a.k.a.
socialism.  Their plan is to use the school system to prepare
children, individually and collectively, only for jobs that are
designated and determined by the planners. 
<p>
One bill, sponsored by two senior Republicans, Steve Gunderson (R-
WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA), is called "A Proposal for the
Establishment of the Department of Education and Employment." 
Riding the tide of the movement to abolish the Department of
Education, their bill would simply consolidate it with the
Department of Labor and put Robert Reich in charge.
<p>
This bill would convert public schools into "Workforce Preparation"
centers "to meet the challenges of a competitive global economy in
the 21st century."  Schoolchildren would be trained, rather than
educated, and schools would become "efficient delivery systems" to
serve the global economy.
<p>
A variation of this same goal, called the "Consolidated and
Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act"
(H.R. 1617), known by its acronym CAREERS, was introduced on May 11
and speedily passed out of committee on June 22.  Sponsored by Rep.
Howard McKeon (R-CA), it is actually modeled on a bill introduced
earlier this year by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) called the
"Workforce Development Act" (S. 180).
<p>
H.R. 1617 was designed to deceive conservatives by repealing last
year's "Schools-to-Work" Act and some other cumbersome and
redundant jobs and education programs.  However, H.R. 1617's 233
pages contain much more dangerous replacements.
<p>
Three key provisions in the Republican CAREERS bill parallel the
key provisions of Kennedy's "Workforce" bill.
<p>
The first key provision is that both bills give government the
responsibility for job placement and development through a
"Workforce Development Plan."  Kennedy's "Workforce" bill would
implement this through federal, state and local boards.  McKeon's
CAREERS bill specifies that the Governor shall submit "a strategic
state workforce development and literacy plan to provide policy
guidance with respect to workforce development progress" that meets
the requirements of the U.S. Secretaries of Education and Labor.
<p>
The second key provision of both "Workforce" and CAREERS is a labor
market information system (LMIS).  "Workforce" calls for a
"comprehensive, integrated labor market [information] system to
assure that workforce development programs are related to the
demand for particular skills in a local labor market."  CAREERS
would amend the 1933 Wagner Act to enumerate the information that
will be collected, managed and shared between the private and
public sectors.
<p>
CAREERS sets up a "comprehensive and coordinated labor market
information system" that will "project employment opportunities and
trends" based on "profiles of employers" and the "education and
training of job seekers."  The data collection system will record
how well the schoolchild did on the "performance assessments" of
the state's "goals and objectives" that are part of "Goals 2000,"
and be so thorough that even the "level of satisfaction of the
participants" will be measured and recorded.
<p>
The premise of the LMIS is the assumption that government
committees know what is best for the individual and for the
economy.  This is the structure under which the Soviets managed
their planned economy for so many decades, with Five-Year and Ten-
Year Plans that always failed.
<p>
Government economic planning is an abysmal failure worldwide, and
it's hard to think of anything that would be a bigger detriment to
future economic growth.  Can you imagine, for example, that any
government planning board would have decided in the 1980s that
workers needed to be trained for the immense computer and
communications industry that has arisen since then?
<p>
The third key provision in both Kennedy's "Workforce" bill and
McKeon's CAREERS bill is "one-stop career centers" (probably
located at public schools).  This is where the individual comes in
contact with the national economic planning system.
<p>
Based on economic projections by the different tiers of boards and
the vast collection of data on individuals, the "one-stop career
center" will train individuals for designated job slots.
<p>
The bottom line of these bills is to give the Federal Government
the power over every individual's ability to earn a living.  If we
let the government decide what jobs are "needed," what jobs young
people may be trained for, what performance and "outcome" standards
may be enforced on schoolchildren, and what certificate qualifies
them to be hired, and then track each individual's performance and
behavior in school and through the workforce on a national computer
data base, we will have lost freedom in America.

<center><h2>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly August 10, 1995
<p>
<p>
Ever since the Smithsonian Institution earlier this year tried to
give us all a guilty conscience about the B-29 named Enola Gay,
we've been inundated with a torrent of breastbeating about the
dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima.  The 50th anniversary of
August 6, 1945 is supposed to make us all hang our heads in shame.
<p>
Newsweek accompanied pages of ugly pictures with a poll reporting
that Americans now think dropping the bomb on Japan was "wrong." 
But the poll demographics tell a different story.  The senior
citizens whose lives were on the line in World War II approve of
the bombing, while the younger generations that don't remember
World War II have the luxury of sanctimonious second-guessing.
<p>
For the men who fought World War II, the atom bomb was a lifesaver
in every meaning of the word.  Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima meant
the difference between life and death to hundreds of thousands of
our best and brightest young men.
<p>
Dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima meant that those fine young
American men could come home, grow up to live normal lives, marry
and raise families, instead of dying a tortured death 5,000 miles
away.  The lucky ones would have identifiable graves.
<p>
What the Hiroshima bomb accomplished was to preempt General George
Marshall's horrendous plan to defeat Japan:  an island-by-island
invasion at a projected cost of a half million American deaths.
<p>
The first phase, called Operation Olympic, would have sent 650,000
American servicemen starting November 1, 1945 to try to capture the
island of Kyushu.  It would have been a slaughter because the
Japanese were prepared to defend Kyushu with 540,000 troops and
5,000 kamikaze planes.
<p>
The follow-up invasion, called Operation Coronet, was scheduled to
start the drive toward Tokyo on March 1, 1946.  U.S. plans
projected an invasion force of two million men.
<p>
Marshall couldn't have had any illusions about the hideous human
cost of such an island-by-island invasion.  Iwo Jima had given us
a preview.
<p>
On February 19, 1945, 30,000 Marines landed on that little five-
mile island, and five days later planted the U.S. flag, an event
immortalized in the most famous war photograph in history.  When
the Iwo Jima battle ended a month later, the price we had paid for
raising our flag was 26,000 casualties including more than 6,800
dead (including three of the six men in the photograph).
<p>
Japanese soldiers were tough fighters.  Under orders not to be
captured alive, only 1,000 were taken prisoner while 22,000 died
defending Iwo Jima.
<p>
With those kinds of casualty figures, only a reckless disregard of
American lives could cause a U.S. leader to send American troops to
invade Japanese home islands.  But that was the Marshall plan, even
though he knew from the coded messages we had intercepted that
Japan planned to defend its home islands with 2.3 million troops,
another four million Army and Navy employees, and an armed militia
of 28 million, all sworn to fight to the death.
<p>
Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman's military adviser, predicted that
30 to 35 percent of U.S. soldiers would be killed or wounded during
the first 30 days of an invasion of Japan.  The Hiroshima bomb
saved those lives, as well as those of about 400,000 Allied
prisoners of war and civilian detainees held by the Japanese, whom
Japan had planned to execute in the event of an American invasion. 
<p>
President Harry (the buck stops here) Truman didn't have any
difficulty making the atom bomb decision, and he shouldn't have. 
He told reporters in 1947 that "I didn't have any doubts at the
time" because the decision saved 250,000 to 500,000 American lives.
<p>
"I'd do it again," Truman said in 1956.  In 1962, he added, "I knew
I'd done the right thing."
<p>
Nor did other Americans at the time have any qualms about the loss
of life in the country that had started the war with a sneak attack
on Pearl Harbor.  Newsweek, for example, cheered the fact that
"perhaps one million persons were made homeless" by our firebombing
of Tokyo.
<p>
The argument is made today that we should not have dropped the bomb
because "Japan was already seeking to surrender."  In an interview
with veteran journalist Philip Clarke in 1962, Truman answered,
"The bombs were dropped after Japan had been warned that we had
discovered the greatest explosive in the history of the world and
then we asked them to surrender.  They did not do it."
<p>
Japan didn't even surrender after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. 
It took the second atom bomb at Nagasaki, three days later, to
induce Japan to surrender.
<p>
Instead of being haunted by the ghosts of Hiroshima, Americans
today should remember the American heroes of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal,
Midway, and Okinawa, and rejoice that the survivors of those bloody
battles lived to come home to America instead of being killed on
the beaches of Japan.

<title>LET'S ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>
</head>

<center><h2>Let's Abolish The Department of Education</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly  August 17, 1995
<p>
<p>
Abolishing the Department of Education was one of Ronald Reagan's
campaign promises when he ran for President in 1980.  Fulfilling
that promise is long overdue, and the time to do it is now.
<p>
Education is not a department that has always been with us like
State, Treasury, and Justice.  The Department of Education was
created as a payoff to the National Education Association (NEA) for
its early endorsement of Jimmy Carter's presidential candidacy in
1976.
<p>
That NEA endorsement was a significant factor in giving Carter
national visibility and momentum.  At that time, the little-known
one-term Governor of a southern state was considered a long shot by
most observers.
<p>
The NEA has the same symbiotic relationship with Bill Clinton.  On
his way to the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated
him, he stopped off for a visit with Keith Geiger, then NEA
president, and promised to invite him to sleep in Abe Lincoln's bed
at the White House. 
<p>
Contrary to the gloom-and-doom fearmongering of the education
lobby, U.S. public schools will not collapse if the Department of
Education is abolished.  Public schools flourished before there was
any Department of Education (and academic standards were much
higher), and public schools will continue to exist if the
Department is abolished.
<p>
Federal spending in public schools amounts to only about six
percent of their total budget.  Every week we read about
corporations successfully downsizing their workforce and thereby
achieving greater efficiency, so public schools should have no
difficulty downsizing by six percent.  Their top-heavy and
redundant administrative bureaucracy is a scandal, anyway.
<p>
Congress doles out 70 billion federal tax dollars per year on what
is euphemistically called education.  The mere listing of the
programs is awesome and depressing.
<p>
The Department of Education spends $33 billion a year of this
amount administering 244 different programs.  The remainder of the
$70 billion is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 programs,
which the General Accounting Office says "often are duplicative and
overlapping."
<p>
More than 90 federal preschool and child care programs are
administered through eleven federal agencies and 20 offices that
target children of similar ages and provide similar services. 
There are 86 federal programs in nine federal departments that
offer teacher training.
<p>
At least 46 federal programs administered by eight federal agencies
are working on what is called youth development.  Fourteen
different programs provide food and food-related assistance.  At
least 163 federal programs, spread out among 15 departments and
agencies, say they are providing employment and training
assistance.
<p>
This federal spending imposes a costly paperwork burden on local
schools.  A 1991 survey of Ohio school districts reported that
schools must complete 173 federal reports and forms.  
<p>
We should face the fact that, like welfare, our 30 year experiment
in federal spending on education has failed.  Illiteracy has
reached epidemic levels and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have
dropped 73 points since 1960.
<p>
Incidentally, the decline in SAT scores is now going to be
concealed from the public starting this year by the simple device
of raising every test score nearly 100 points.  They call this
"centering," but another word for it is cheating.
<p>
The 1994 election sent a strong message to Congress:  cut federal
spending, reduce government, eliminate agencies.  Unfortunately,
some Congressmen seem to think they can pretend to abolish the
Department of Education while merely shifting the functions and the
spending to other agencies.
<p>
It is a bafflement how any Congressman could think that the
constituency eager to abolish the Department of Education could be
appeased by transferring the functions and the spending to Labor
Secretary Robert Reich or Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala.  Yet those are the most discussed proposals for education
"reform." 
<p>
Out across America, the mood of the people is just the opposite.  
Three states this year actually rejected federal funding for Goals
2000, a truly remarkable reaction to the offer of goodies from the
federal treasury.
<p>
The U.S. Constitution doesn't mention education, and there is no
authority in the Constitution for the Federal Government to meddle
in local schools.  Education is not a proper federal function.
<p>
If the Federal Government has no constitutional authority to ban
guns from schools (which the Supreme Court ruled in this year's
Lopez decision), then it follows a fortiori that the Federal
Government has no authority to impose curricular requirements or
hand out funds according to the whims and the politics of federal
officials.
<p>
Public schools in America were vastly superior before the Federal
Government turned on the funding faucet.  It's time to write finis
to federal aid to education and return that $70 billion per year to
the American people in tax cuts.

<h3>WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PROMOTING MANAGED CARE?</h3>
By <a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Republicans spent two years attacking the totalitarian Clinton
Health Plan because it would put all Americans into Managed Care,
allow medical care only as permitted by Gatekeepers, deny our right
to choose our own doctor, limit access to specialists, and force us
to enroll in Regional Alliances with more government control and
price fixing.  Republicans won the argument, defeated all versions
of Clintoncare, and used Clinton's Health Plan as a central issue
in winning a Republican majority in Congress.<p>
Now, it's hard to believe, but the Republican Congressional
leadership has warmed over the same bad ideas and is touting them
as Medicare reform.  If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole think they can
sell the same bad product that Bill Clinton failed to sell, they
are out of touch with the real world.<p>
Drafts of the Republican Medicare reform that have leaked out 
indicate that it is based on herding seniors into Managed Care
(HMOs).  The Managed Care lobby reputedly has $9 billion (not
million) in cash reserves to soft-sell its propaganda, so it's not
surprising that Republican spokesmen are suddenly praising Managed
Care.<p>
Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) is appearing on television as a spokesman
for the Republican Medicare plan.  Using data provided by the Group
Health Association of America, the HMO trade group, he claims that
people just love HMOs.<p>
The Managed Care lobby has succeeded in making Rep. Bill Thomas (R-
CA), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, their
chief Managed Care advocate in the House.  His statements on
managed care on a PBS special to be aired in September are truly
incredible, according to one reporter who has previewed it.<p>
Thomas was asked to address the complaint of a person who can no
longer choose his doctor because his company switched to an HMO. 
Thomas repled, "I'd ask you a couple of questions.  How did you
find your first doctor?  Well, the answer is that it was probably
a friend of a friend, or you looked in the Yellow Pages."<p>
"And this," he exclaimed, "is the sacred system that someone wants
to defend! Now, you created a personal relationship, which you
don't want to change.  There's no reason in the world why that
personal relationship couldn't be recreated."<p>
Sorry, Bill, seniors are not going to let you "recreate" personal
relationships with their doctors.  Seniors are not dumb and they
vote, so they may decide to "recreate" their relationship with
their Congressman and elect one who will stand up for the right to
choose your own doctor.<p>
Republicans claim that their Medicare plan would offer seniors more
"options" among "plans."  That's an illusion.  The only option that
matters is the option to choose your specialist and your treatment
when you are sick.  HMOs put those choices in the hands of
Gatekeepers who receive increased pay for limiting access.<p>
Republicans made a terrible blunder in letting Medicare become the
number-one issue of the 1995-1996 campaign.  It's a losing issue
for Republicans, and their arguments are not selling at the
grassroots.<p>
The Gephardt line is powerful:  "Republicans are cutting the
benefits and raising taxes on the elderly in order to give tax
breaks to the rich."  As top Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said: 
"Linking Medicare reforms to tax cuts is a potent line of attack. 
Hurting beneficiaries is what matters."<p>
The Republican leadership must change its strategy and make Medical
Savings Accounts for today's workers (i.e., H.R. 1818) the
centerpiece of health care reform.  Go for the votes of the 30-55
year old age group and tell the truth:<p>
"Medicare as we know it is not going to be there when you are
age65.  We Republicans are going to make sure you have health care
by allowing you to set up your personal tax-deductible Medical
Savings Account (MSA) so that you will have your own money to
provide your health care needs.  With MSAs, you can choose your own
doctor, save for health care in retirement and long-term care, and
avoid HMO gatekeepers."<p>
Medicare was the crown jewel of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. 
The underlying premise is that today's workers should be taxed to
pay for the health care of the elderly.  It's a Ponzi scheme that
only works as long as more people are paying into the system than
are receiving benefits.  When the baby boomers reach 65, the Ponzi
scheme will totally collapse, with or without Medicare HMOs.<p>
Liberal Democrats know that MSAs represent a direct challenge to
their generation-transfer scheme.  They hope that Republicans
continue to expend their political capital in politically fatal
Medicare ""reform'' rather than giving baby boomers a personal
medical savings account, which would liberate them from socialized
medicine in retirement.<p>
Medical Savings Accounts are not only smart politics, but they are
the best long-term solution for financing our health care system. <p>

<P>
<h2>Is the Government Planning Your Child's Career?</h2> <P>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center><P>

<hr><P> 
Republican Presidential candidates criss-crossing the country have 
discovered that one of their best hot-button applause lines is "I 
promise to abolish the Department of Education." Out in the byways of 
America, parents know that public schools are a disaster area and that 
Federal Government spending has hurt, not helped, the situation. 
 <p>
So it is a puzzlement why the Republican House just passed an 
education bill that increases federal control and involvement in the 
public schools rather than reducing it. Called the "CAREERS" bill, it 
uses federal dollars to expand and institutionalize one of the worst 
Clinton bills passed last year, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. 
 <p>
Republican Congressmen who voted for this bill are sending six-page 
handouts to their constituents purporting to show how amendments have 
"answered parents' concerns." But opponents of CAREERS didn't merely 
have "concerns" about the CAREERS bill; they recognize it as the 
philosophy we thought we defeated in the 1994 election. 
 <p>
When one takes time to read the CAREERS bill, it is obvious that it is 
the legislative implementation of an 18-page letter written by Marc 
Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, 
to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, just after the Presidential 
election. This letter states that it was the result of a meeting in 
David Rockefeller's office, at which those present were "literally 
radiating happiness" at Clinton's victory. 
 <p>
They were celebrating their plans for what "you [Hillary] and Bill 
should do now about education, training and labor market policy." 
Tucker's letter laid out their master plan to "remold" the public 
schools into a "national human resources development system," which 
would be "guided by clear standards that define the stages of the 
system for the people who progress through it, and regulated on the 
basis of outcomes that providers produce for their clients." 
 <p>
Tucker's vision is aggressively ambitious. His letter called for "a 
seamless web" that "literally extends from cradle to grave and is the 
same system for everyone -- young and old, poor and rich, worker and 
full-time student." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" includes a national employment service in 
which "all available front-line jobs, whether public or private, must 
be listed in it by law." Then, "a system of labor market boards is 
established at the local, state and federal levels to coordinate the 
systems for job training, postsecondary professional and technical 
education, adult basic education, job matching and counseling." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" calls for government to be in the drivers' 
seat at every stage of the "human resources development system." The 
"labor market boards" will decide what jobs may be allowed, and the 
schools will "train" students (the human resources) for jobs selected 
by the "labor market boards." 
 <p>
The "new general education standard" (i.e., a state-certified 
"certificate of mastery" rather than a diploma) will become a 
"prerequisite for enrollment in all professional and technical degree 
programs," as well as for all hiring. Tucker's letter lays out how, 
under his system, schools will be required to provide information "to 
government agencies in a uniform format." 
 <p>
Tucker's letter makes it clear why so much of the discussion about 
Congressional appropriations for education includes references to the 
Department of Labor. Tucker and his friends have been planning to meld 
Labor and Education functions ever since Lynn Martin, Secretary of 
Labor in the Bush Administration, published the SCANS report. 
 <p>
Much of Marc Tucker's ambitious plan is already in place. Last year, 
Clinton signed the Goals 2000 Act, which requires schools to adopt 
"standards," and the School-to-Work law, which lays the groundwork for 
using high schools to train students for occupations selected by the 
local labor market boards. 
 <p>
The CAREERS bill expands on School-to-Work and perfectly tracks the 
Tucker letter. The CAREERS text states that the Governor of each state 
(if he wants the funds) shall "designate" the establishment of "a 
local workforce development board" in each local area. In the House 
debate on CAREERS on September 19, Education Opportunities Committee 
Chairman William Goodling (R-PA) stated that the bill requires that 
"training be tied to occupations in demand in the local community." 
 <p>
CAREERS makes it clear that government will now assume the power to 
set up workforce development plans, with a comprehensive and 
coordinated labor market computer system, and that students will be 
trained only to work in the occupations prescribed by the government. 
<p> 
In the House debate, Goodling boasted that the White House is pleased 
with this legislation. He admitted that the CAREERS bill has been in 
preparation "for 2 years," which places the date at long before 
Republicans became a majority in the House. 
 <p>
When you combine this workforce system with the schools' obvious 
failure to teach children to read and the dumbing down process called 
Outcome-Based Education, the result will be a Third World education to 
accustom Americans to Third World wages. The "powers that be" want 
public school graduates to be content to compete with workers in 
foreign countries who work for 1/40th of American wages. 
<p> 
Think about that every time you hear politicians, businessmen, 
educators and bureaucrats talking on television about "competing in 
the global economy" and becoming "citizens of the world."

<h2>Beware of Global Taxes for Global Entitlements </h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"It's not sustainable for member states to enjoy representation 
without taxation," Prime Minister John Major told the United Nations 
at its birthday celebration. He thought he was demonstrating British 
wit in making a play on the great slogan of the American Revolution. 
We are not amused. 
<p> 
The United Nations has a big problem: the tax-cutting Republican 
Congress is disinclined to continue financing those overpaid foreign 
bureaucrats in the lavish style to which they have become accustomed. 
So their solution is to impose a global tax that would produce 
billions or even trillions of dollars without any Congressional 
action. 
 <p>
The so-called Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life 
has issued a report listing dozens of innovative global devices to tax 
people, corporations, and international business activities. These 
include taxes on aviation traffic and freight, ocean freight and 
cruises, aviation fuel, telecommunications frequencies, communications 
satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods and 
services. 
 <p>
The global tax idea was first publicly launched at the UN World Summit 
for Social Development, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995. 
James G. Speth, the Clinton-appointed head of the UN Development 
Program, called for a global tax on speculative movements of 
international funds, the consumption of non-renewable energy, 
environmental permits, and the arms trade. 
 <p>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. The UN bureaucrats are 
licking their chops at Tobin's prediction that "the revenue potential 
is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year," and they are now 
enthusiastically using Tobin's prestige to advocate what they call the 
"Tobin tax." 
 <p>
The Commission on Global Governance, a "private" group with government 
and foundation funding, published a volume this year entitled "Our 
Global Neighborhood." Stating that "it is time for a consensus on 
global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood," 
this report calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. 
 <p>
This report also brags that "the idea of safeguarding and managing the 
global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted. And the notion of expanding the 
role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military 
security." 
 <p>
Another model for a global tax is hidden in the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, a UN treaty the Clinton Administration is trying to 
get the Senate to ratify. This treaty sets up a global taxing 
authority called the International Seabed Authority to collect fees 
and royalties imposed on American mining firms. 
 <p>
An outfit called Worldwatch Institute issued a report this year called 
"Partnership for the Planet." It calls for a global tax to finance 
"the transition to a sustainable society -- including environmental 
programs, social initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." 
 <p>
Just as the new Republican Congress is trying to put a lid on welfare 
and Medicare entitlements, the UN is planning to saddle U.S. taxpayers 
with global entitlements. The Oxfam Poverty Report proclaims that 
"international aid should be seen as a financial entitlement, and as 
part of a compact between citizens in the industrial and developing 
worlds." 
 <p>
UN bureaucrats and advocates must be having lots of fun dreaming up 
ways to tax Americans to support their notions of "global 
neighborhood" and "sustainable human development." The Ford Foundation 
produced a study last year called "Renewing the United Nations 
System," which advocates an annual "United Nations lottery, 
administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General." 
 <p>
The Ford Foundation also financed a report called "The United Nations 
in Its Second Half-Century," which calls for allowing the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. 
Rationalized as a "levy on the utilization of the global commons," 
this proposal would enable the UN to bypass Congress in accessing U.S. 
taxpayers' money. 
 <p>
Other wealthy liberal foundations that have helped orchestrate the 
demand for a global tax include the MacArthur and Carnegie 
Foundations. The World Federalist Association, now headed by former 
presidential candidate John B. Anderson, weighs in with a 
recommendation for UN taxes on international travel and postal 
service. 
 <p>
Bella Abzug, who was so visible in the recent UN Women's Conference in 
Beijing, also serves as a member of the advisory council of the Global 
Commission to Fund the United Nations. It comes as no surprise that 
she endorses global taxes as a way to finance and enforce the radical 
feminist agenda that she presented at the UN conferences on population 
and women's issues. 
 <p>
Americans had better wake up and expel the UN before it succeeds in 
any of its arrogant global taxing plans. Congress should hold hearings 
on the outrageous global tax schemes exposed by researcher Cliff 
Kincaid for Americans for Tax Reform.

<h2>Don't Turn the Clock Back to Rockefeller Republicanism</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
Ever since the four-term phenomenon of Franklin D. Roosevelt, two very 
different factions have wrestled for control of the Republican Party. 
On the one hand are the grassroots Republicans, Main Street Americans, 
who labor in the precincts to elect candidates they hope will be 
faithful after election.
<p> 
On the other hand are the powerful people who fancy themselves as 
kingmakers, the wheelers and dealers of the proverbial smoke- filled 
rooms, also known as the New York or Wall Street or eastern liberal 
establishment. They include the multinational corporations (whose most 
recent accomplishment was the Mexican bailout) and the Business 
Roundtable types, whose fingers of control slither through what is 
called the media elite. 
<p>
These kingmakers are Big Government Republicans. They seek to maintain 
the current high level of federal spending, and they want to control 
how the money is spent. They are liberals, but their favorite word to 
identify themselves is "moderate." 
<p>
In 1940 the New York kingmakers created the 60-day wonder named 
Wendell Willkie. He was a registered Democrat, but the kingmakers 
manufactured a new image for him through a media blitz and made him 
the Republican nominee for President. 
<p>
In 1944 and 1948, the kingmakers forced the Republican Party to 
nominate the man who brought the expression "me too" into the 
political lexicon. Voters opted for the real Democrat in 1944 and 
1948, not the carbon copy. 
<p>
In 1952 the New York kingmakers felt threatened by the rise of the 
conservative movement led by Senator Bob Taft. The issue was clear: 
Taft had pledged to reduce the level of federal spending 
significantly, so the liberal Republicans set out to defeat him at all 
costs. By the narrowest of margins, the New York kingmakers stole the 
1952 Republican National Convention for a military hero, Dwight 
Eisenhower. 
<p>
During Ike's two terms, the liberals initiated all kinds of big 
federal spending programs that have plagued us ever since, such as 
federal aid to education. It was no surprise that Republican seats in 
Congress steadily declined. 
<p>
In 1964, the New York kingmakers tried to force Republicans to 
nominate Nelson Rockefeller, a Big Government, internationalist 
Republican Governor who raised taxes, engaged in profligate spending 
of the taxpayers' money, and me-tooed the liberal Democratic policies. 
They failed; grassroots conservatives asserted their majority position 
in the Republican Party by nominating Barry Goldwater and repudiating 
Rockefeller Republicanism. 
<p>
The Rockefeller cabal then cooperated with the media moguls in a 
campaign to defeat Goldwater that was marked by unprecedented hysteria 
and vicious smears. The result was Lyndon B. Johnson and the 
exponential expansion of Big Government under the Great Society. 
<p>
In the following years, conservatives were cowed by a constant 
refrain. "You conservatives had your chance with Barry Goldwater. His 
defeat proves America will never elect a conservative, so the best you 
can hope for is Richard Nixon." 
<p>
The Nixon regime proved that conservatives are fools to accept half a 
loaf. In foreign policy, his appointee Henry Kissinger continued the 
disastrous McNamara policies of abandoning our strategic superiority 
to the Soviets. In domestic policy, Nixon admitted he was a Keynesian 
and even inflicted price controls on us. 
<p>
In 1976 the fainthearted persuaded a scant majority of Republicans to 
stick with the "moderate," Gerald Ford. However, even that "moderate" 
Republican National Convention was unwilling to take Rockefeller as 
Ford's running mate. 
<p>
Finally, in 1980, Ronald Reagan mainstreamed conservatism as the 
vision and the values of Middle America. He drew conservative and pro-
family Democrats and independents into the Republican Party. 
<p>
Reagan's vision of conservatism consists of four specific elements: 
limited government with lower taxes; personal responsibility with a 
disdain for taxpayer handouts for personal or social causes; military 
superiority so our armed forces can protect our independence 
(specifically including SDI); and respect for life and family values. 
<p>
Each of these four elements of Reagan's conservatism has a large 
constituency among the American people. The coalition produced the 
greatest Presidency and the biggest Republican victories of our times. 
This Reagan coalition is the model for the future of the Republican 
Party, and casting off any of them would spell defeat for Republicans. 
<p>
It is a puzzlement why Colin Powell identified himself as a 
"Rockefeller Republican," when Nelson Rockefeller was the 
quintessential representative of the eastern liberal establishment. To 
the grassroots conservatives who are now the dominant majority in the 
Republican Party, Rockefeller Republicanism means "in your face" Big 
Government liberalism. 
<p>
To nominate a Rockefeller Republican in 1996 would be turning the 
clock back to 1964 when that crowd lost the watershed battle between 
grassroots conservatives vs. the establishment. It would be as foolish 
as refighting the Civil Rights Act, the other defining battle of 1964. 
<p>
The Reagan model teaches us that authentic conservatism is the road to
 victory. Conservative Republicans don't have to settle for a me-tooer 
or a liberal or a "moderate" masquerading as a conservative because 
conservatives have the votes to demand the real thing. <p>

<h2>Republicans Want Answers From  
                          Presidential Candidates</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>                    
  

We can debate whether or not the media really tell us what to think, 
but they surely tell us what to think about. The 1996 presidential 
election is still almost a year away, but the media have been forcing 
us to think about it since the beginning of 1995. By the time it is 
over, it will have been nearly a two-year stretch, and we are already 
tired of it. 

Despite the persistent pressures from the perennial pollsters, 
Republican voters are a stubborn lot and a big percentage simply 
refuses to make a choice. Most presidential hopefuls are still 
clustered in single digits. 
<p>
The fact that Ronald Reagan was in single digits at this point before 
his first election doesn't dissuade the media from their demands. The 
abrupt departure from the race of Pete Wilson and then Colin Powell, 
both supposedly ten-ton gorillas, didn't pry Republican voters loose 
from the category of "undecided." 
<p>
Bob Dole's substantial lead is probably the result of, as Morton 
Kondracke has pointed out, the Republican Party's preference for 
primogeniture. As the senior pol, Dole's in line; he's been in office 
so long he deserves it, or so the thinking goes. 
<p>
But political parties aren't hereditary. Voters usually select their 
candidates on the basis of their likability, their articulation of a 
mix of views on issues that voters care about, and the vision and 
leadership they manifest. 
<p>
Most of the presidential political discussion seems to be along the 
following lines. Who wins straw polls among other politicians? Who 
raises the most money? Who has held more important government jobs? 
<p>
Maybe the voters just dont care about those factors, and thats why 
they are holding back. So what issues do the voters care about? 
<p>
What are called the sovereignty questions are the preeminent issues 
that presidential candidates should talk about because they concern 
national integrity and survival. Voters want the answers to a whole 
cluster of questions like these. 
<p>
Do you support barring President Clinton from sending American troops 
to Bosnia by cutting off all taxpayers' money? Where do you stand on 
the prospective Army court-martial of a U.S. soldier for refusing to 
wear the United Nations uniform? 
<p>
Will you stop sending American money to the UN to involve us in 
foreign wars, a practice dishonestly described as "peacekeeping"? Will 
you oppose all efforts to allow the UN to grab any kind of taxing 
power, and will you cut off all money to the World Bank if it diverts 
any of its funds to the UN? 
<p>
Will you oppose the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (as Ronald 
Reagan did) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (promoted 
by Hillary Rodham Clinton)? 
<p>
Will you candidly admit that NAFTA has cost tens of thousands of 
American jobs and take steps to remedy the manifold injuries to 
American workers and taxpayers? Will you get us out of the World Trade 
Organization? 
<p>
What are you going to do about the Mexican bailout? Do you pledge that 
you will never again allow U.S. taxpayers' money to be used to shore 
up foreign currency? 
<p>
What is your plan to stop illegal immigration and to cut off all 
taxpayer benefits to the illegal aliens who are already in this 
country? Will you support a moratorium on legal immigration until we 
deal with the illegal immigration problem? 
<p>
Do you support making English our official language? Will you cut off 
all taxpayer support of foreign language ballots and the language 
apartheid enforced on public schoolchildren in the name of "bilingual 
education"? 
<p>
What is your stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? Will ou cut off taxpayers' handout to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? 
<p>
Are you going to cancel all federal regulations that impose 
affirmative action quotas or set-asides? 
<p>
Education and crime are certainly two hot-button concerns, but they 
are not primarily federal issues. Most of what the Federal Government 
is doing in those areas does not address the real problems, and some 
of what the Federal Government is doing is downright detrimental. 
<p>
It's not the job of the President to reform public schools or see that 
the children are taught how to read and write, but it would be helpful 
if presidential candidates would promise to eliminate federal control 
by abolishing the Department of Education and Goals 2000. 
<p>
Likewise, crime control is and should be primarily a state and local 
matter. But it would be helpful if the Federal Government would get 
moving with prosecutions for the killings carried out by federal 
agents at Ruby Ridge and Waco. 
<p>
Voters want their candidates to address the fact that so many 
Americans feel that government is their enemy, not their protector. 
They want candidates to address specifics such as the government's 
taking of private lands at the behest of the environmental extremists 
and proposals to allow Janet Reno to wiretap the phones of every 
American. 
<p>
Many voters are likely to remain undecided as long as the candidates 
dodge the issues they really care about. <p>

<h2>America Has No Business In Bosnia </h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P> 
                      
  
 
So President Clinton wants to send 20,000 American soldiers to Bosnia. 
The man who ducked out of serving in the Vietnam War now says it's our 
duty to send other men's sons to fight a foreign war. 
<P>
Clinton says he has already committed 20,000 troops and now an 
unsuspecting nation is told we must go along because "he gave his 
word." But Clinton made that rash and casual promise on his own; the 
rest of us are not a party to the deal. And since when is "his word" 
inviolate? 
<P>
Clinton is trying to tell Americans that going to Bosnia is our moral 
duty. But he is no oracle of moral law. We didn't start the war, it 
isn't our obligation to stop it, and foreign policy should not be used 
for social work. 
<P>
Unable to show any vital national interest, the Clinton spin salesmen 
have instructed all Administration spokesmen to say that troops are 
needed in Bosnia to protect our "values," although they never say what 
values they are talking about. The word has no meaning in relation to 
the Bosnia decision; its use is just a cheap attempt to paper over the 
Administration's lack of any reasonable argument. 
<P>
Clinton says we must assert American leadership in the world. But the 
kind of leadership America should assert is political leadership in 
showing the superiority of freedom over totalitarianism, and economic 
leadership in demonstrating the superiority of the free market over 
socialism and government planning. 
<P>
Clinton asserts that it is his prerogative as Commander-in-Chief to 
send troops to Bosnia. But his constitutional authority to dispatch 
troops is only for the purpose of defending Americans or vital 
American interests, not to rush out and join a war that is none of our 
business. Only Congress has the constitutional power to go to war. 
<P>
Clinton argues that we should go into Bosnia to keep the fighting from 
spreading into a bigger war. But he's got it exactly backwards. It is 
U.S. involvement and casualties that turn a local fight into a world 
event. 
<P>
Clinton says our troops will be "peacekeepers." But there is no peace 
in Bosnia; all sides hate each other and one of the warring parties 
has refused to ratify the Dayton accord. Nor can the United States 
pretend to be neutral so soon after we bombed the Serb secessionists. 
<P>
Even if there were peace, U.S. servicemen are not policemen and should 
not be forced to assume that role. Policemen and soldiers are trained 
for different missions, and those purposes should not be blurred. 
<P>
It's not at all clear that anyone can stop the fighting. Balkan 
nations have fought each other for over 500 years, and too much blood 
has been shed over little pieces of land for the enmity to disappear 
in the 12 months of our projected deployment there. 
<P>
The Dayton agreement creates a new Bosnian state with indefensible 
borders and a collective presidency with, in rotation, a Muslim, a 
Serb and a Croat as chairman. Under this inherently unstable 
arrangement, each side will have its own army! 
<P>
If it is truly in the vital interest of Europe to stop the 
bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, let the European countries send 
whatever troops are necessary. Europe has plenty of money and manpower 
to take on the task. 
<P>
Despite the lack of a clear mission as to why we are going in, what 
good we can accomplish, and when we will get out, the entire liberal 
and internationalist establishment plus the media elite are lining up 
to support Clinton's expedition into Bosnia. Let's look at the reasons 
for this curious propaganda push. 
<P>
They want to give NATO something to do before the American people 
realize that NATO has completed its mission of stopping the Soviets 
from invading Europe and now ought to be retired. The Warsaw Pact is 
already "history," but NATO careerists want to keep their bureaucracy 
going through "mission creep." 
<P>
The internationalists remember how hard it was to get the United 
States involved in World Wars I and II. They think that, if they can 
just keep U.S. troops constantly marching around in Europe on any 
make-work project, America will be caught right in the middle if and 
when another big war starts. 
<P>
The internationalists want to get the United States in some kind of 
world government and, since the United Nations is in such disfavor, 
NATO can serve as a useful stepping stone. Using NATO instead of the 
UN will avoid the criticisms about U.S. servicemen wearing UN uniforms 
or serving under foreign commanders. 
<P>
The American people are looking for a leader who will stand up to 
Clinton and say "NO, we are not going to let you drag our nation into 
a foreign war that is none of our business." We are looking for a 
Senator and a Representative who will lead the battle in Congress to 
<P>
cut off all money for use in Bosnia, which Congress has every right 
and constitutional authority to do. 
<P>
And one more thing: "OK with conditions" is not acceptable. We want a 
leader to "just say NO."

<h2>Bilingualism Is The Wrong Way To Go</h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
For the last five years, Political Correctness has forced the academic (and  
much of the political) world to pay homage to the new sacred cows called  
multiculturalism and diversity. Those are usually used as code words to  
challenge the assumption that Western Civilization is the basis of what we  
call the American system, and to pretend that all cultures are equal and  
contributed equally to the America we know.  
 <p> 
This fad seems to be trying to get us to change our national identity from  
E pluribus unum (From the many, one) to E uno plures (From the one, many).  <p>
Indeed, Vice President Al Gore's goof last year indicates that he has  
already made that transition.  
 <p> 
But cultures are not so easily rationalized. Cultures are grounded in  
deeply held emotions, history and relationships that defy logical analysis.  
The separatist movement in Quebec and the fighting in Bosnia are two recent  
evidences of how inherited cultures cause bitter, current problems.  
  <p>
The United States is the world's most stunning example of a nation that has  
peaceably and successfully assimilated people from many disparate cultures.  <p>
So why are some people trying to separate us into factions, emphasizing  
what divides us instead of what unites us?  
  <p>
The $8 billion bureaucratic failure called "bilingual education" keeps more  
than two million immigrant children in a three-to-five year program where  
as much as 90 percent of their school day is spent in their native  
language. Sometimes their teachers speak almost no English.  
  <p>
New York City students are taught in 82 languages, including Kpelle,  
Nyanja, Twi, Gurma, Ewe, Cham, and others most Americans have never heard  
of. The bureaucrats try to put all children with Hispanic-sounding names in  
bilingual education programs even though they may be fully English-speaking  
and come from English- speaking homes.  
  <p>
The term bilingual education is a complete misnomer because there is no  
requirement that children in bilingual programs ever become fluent in  
English. Our tax dollars are used to promote unilingual education in the  
immigrant's native tongue, and this is nurturing a permanent,  
non-English-speaking subculture.  
  <p>
Without any proof that bilingual classes promote their announced purpose,  
and despite the opposition of the majority of those the program is supposed  
to serve, the bilingual education lobby has shifted its objective. It is  
now trying to make foreign language and culture an integral component of  
American society.  
  <p>
Some advocates see bilingual education as the first step in a radical  
transformation of the United States into a nation without one common  
language or fixed borders. Josue Gonzales, director of bilingual education  
during the Carter Administration and now a professor at Columbia University  
Teachers College, says that Spanish "should no longer be regarded as a  
foreign language" but should be considered "a second national language."  
  <p>
Some in the bilingual lobby have even more extreme views. At the annual  
conference of the National Association for Bilingual Education in Phoenix  
in February 1995, several speakers challenged the very idea of U.S.  
sovereignty and promoted the notion that the Southwest and northern Mexico  
are really one cultural region, which they call La Frontera.  
  <p>
Eugene Garcia, head of bilingual education at the U.S. Department of  
Education in the Clinton Administration, told the conferees that "the  
border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that  
border shall be nonexistent." His rhetoric was greeted by thunderous  
applause.  <p>
  
The November 1994 meeting of the Texas Association for Bilingual Education  
in Austin featured both the Mexican and American flags on the stage. The  
teachers and school personnel in attendance stood for the singing of the  
national anthems of both countries. The political battle over California's  
Proposition 187 in 1994 featured a huge demonstration of people marching  
with Mexican, not U.S., flags.  
  <p>
The bilingual movement should be stopped before it causes any more damage  
to our national fabric. At least it should be stopped insofar as this lobby  
is financed by the taxpayers, and those who work for separatist causes  
should do so on their own dollar, not ours.  
  <p>
Rep. Toby Roth (R-WI), with 91 co-sponsors, has introduced a bill to make  
English our official language. It would end the government's multilingual  
policies, including bilingual education, voting ballots in languages other  
than English, and foreign language citizenship ceremonies.  
  <p>
You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools  
should be mandated to teach all children in English.  
  <p>
President Theodore Roosevelt said it best: "The one absolute certain way of  
bringing this nation to ruin would be to permit it to become a tangle of  
squabbling nationalities. We have but one flag. We must also have but one  
language, and that language is English."

<h2>The Health Care Dilemma of Patients Who Can't Read</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"Our health care system requires that patients be able to read." That 
ought to be a self-evident truth that is silly to enunciate, but it is 
actually the sensational revelation of a major problem just made 
public in the December JAMA (Journal of the American Medical 
Association). 
<p>
The JAMA article reports on the first study ever made to test literacy 
using words combined with numbers that are in common use in health 
care. It was a cross-sectional research project conducted at two urban 
hospitals, one in Georgia, the other in California. 
<p>
The massive National Adult Literacy Survey made by the U.S. government 
in 1993 concluded that 40 to 44 million adults are functionally 
illiterate and that another 50 million are only marginally literate. 
This new health literacy study specifically measured the ability of 
patients to read and understand medical instructions and health care 
information according to a test called TOFHLA (Test of Functional 
Health Literacy in Adults) and discovered that 33 percent of patients 
did not understand instructions for common procedures written at the 
fourth grade level. 
<p>
This health literacy study measured the ability of patients to perform 
such tasks as reading labels on prescription bottles, instructions 
about how often to take medication, notices about when is the next 
doctor's appointment, informed consent forms, instructions about 
diagnostic tests, and how to complete insurance forms. The depressing 
conclusion is that a high percentage of patients simply can't read 
well enough to function in our health care system. 
<p>
People with inadequate literacy skills are unable to read a 
thermometer, write down instructions by telephone, or read common 
medical terms such as "orally," "teaspoon," and "hours." <p>They can't 
access useful messages from newspaper and magazine articles, 
educational materials, posters in supermarkets, or billboards about 
the importance of screening procedures or flu shots. 
<p>
Health care standards require hospitals to provide patients with 
understandable health instructions, but do not require that the 
instructions be understood. Hospitals assume they are complying if 
they give patients a readable document, but a written instruction 
assumes that the patients can read. 
<p>
Patients who can't read informed consent forms present doctors and 
hospitals with what the researchers call "a troubling ethical issue." <p>
Even if an effort is made to simplify the forms to the sixth grade 
level, that still will not reach the many who are functionally 
illiterate. 
<p>
This health literacy project turned up other new and useful 
information not hitherto unearthed by previous literacy surveys made 
by educational institutions. 
<p>
Neither appearance nor years of schooling adequately predicts 
illiteracy. This means that illiteracy is not just a problem for 
minority dropouts or recent immigrants, but is a handicap suffered by 
all races and classes of people who have no visible signs of 
disability and have spent many years in school. 
<p>
Many illiterates do not realize that they have a problem. They are 
like myopic children who don't know that they are simply not seeing 
details that others see. 
<p>
Ronald Reagan tells in his autobiography how, as a young boy riding in 
the back seat of an automobile, he picked up someone else's glasses 
and tried them on. Suddenly he was able to see the leaves on the trees 
and other landscape details for the first time. Until that moment of 
revelation, he hadn't known that other children had been seeing so 
many things that he did not see. 
<p>
The predicament of illiterates is similar. Never having been able to 
communicate with the printed word, they have no comprehension of the 
vast world from which they are excluded. 
<p>
Even more prevalent is the pervasive problem of shame. People with 
limited literacy skills try to hide their inability to read. The large 
majority of illiterates describe themselves as reading and writing 
"well" or "very well." 
<p>
The health literacy study shows that, among patients with low literacy 
skills, 67.2 percent have never told their spouse, 53.4 percent have 
never told their own children, and 19 percent have never told anyone 
at all. 
<p>
I can confirm this from my own experience. In counseling adults, I 
frequently hear such confessions as "I can't read big words" and "I 
just discovered that my husband can't read." 
<p>
The health literacy study admits that patients' noncompliance with 
their medical instructions has been generally assumed by physicians 
and hospitals to be caused by poor motivation or different personal 
values. The study calls for a reevaluation of patients who have been 
labelled "uncooperative"; it is more likely that doctors and hospital 
personnel, to whom reading is as natural as breathing, never imagined 
that the patients just couldn't read their instructions. 
<p>
The JAMA article recognizes that illiteracy is not a disease and its 
solution cannot be medicalized. Since doctors and hospitals can't 
provide the solution, and the schools have obviously failed in the 
task, parents will have to take on the responsibility of teaching 
their children how to read.

<h2>
AMERICA LATINA: MAS MITOS QUE METAS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Luis Aguilar Len*
</a>

<P>
MIAMI (AIPE).-  Proclamar que la Amrica Latina est en crisis implica un
cierto simplismo. La Amrica Latina vive en crisis. Desde la batalla de
Ayacucho hasta nuestros das, la historia de la Amrica Latina es la
historia de una crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En ocasiones la crisis estalla en revoluciones y golpes de estado;
usualmente se desarrolla con reprimida violencia, ltimamente, cuando la
democracia ha asomado su vendada cabeza en el continente, flotan los ecos de
enormes deudas externas, guerrillas con mscaras de narcotrfico (o
viceversa), roces fronterizos y, sobre todo, una corrupcin oficial que,
como una ola de mugre, se abate sobre el continente derribando presidentes,
ministros, partidos y debilitando al propio sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cabe preguntarse: Hacia dnde va la Amrica Latina?  Dnde estn los
planes de futuro?, cules son las metas reales?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las respuestas podran comenzar sealando que la Amrica Latina vive tan
intensamente algunos mitos que apenas si se preocupa por sealarse metas.
Hace ms de 150 aos, por ejemplo, nos proclamamos jvenes y, hasta hace muy
poco, excusbamos todo tropiezo como natural error de la inexperiencia. Nada
aprendimos de aquella irona de Oscar Wilde: "La juventud de Amrica es una
de sus ms viejas tradiciones".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Despus surgi el mito de nuestra latinidad, una frmula defensiva de una
elite criolla en busca de una identidad rasgada por aquel comentario de
Bolvar: "Si no somos ni indios, ni negros, ni europeos, qu somos?". Las
minoras cultas dieron con una respuesta luminosa: somos latinos. Y as de
golpe, a pura voluntad, nos adscribimos a un terico mundo latino, a la
vieja Roma y, sobre todo, a nuestra amada Francia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El amor de los latinoamericanos por Francia es uno de los fenmenos ms
curiosos de la historia. Francia nunca se ocup mucho de la Amrica Latina,
excepto para enviar tropas a Hait, a Mxico y la marina de guerra a la
Argentina. Pero todo se le perdonaba a la madre Francia, tierra de poetas
egregios, "maestra de la vida risuea", cuyo Pars los latinoamericanos
sentan como suyo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En las casas de las elites cultas no podan faltar grabados y libros
franceses. Los latinos aprendan La Marsellesa antes de aprender los himnos
nacionales. El genio de Vctor Hugo produca vrtigos. Tan apasionada
admiracin no hubiera sido daina, que Francia mucho nos poda ensear, si
no hubiera desembocado en una ms deletrea exageracin: el culpar a los
yankees por todos los males del continente.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1898, sacudidas por la derrota de Espaa y por la evidencia del
podero norteamericano, las minoras latinoamericanas exacerbaron ese otro
rostro del mito. Casi sin quererlo, el uruguayo Jos Enrique Rod esboz la
frmula. Los gringos son ricos, poderosos, industriales y trabajadores, pero
son como Calibn, les falta alma, no tienen verdadera cultura, no son
espirituales. En cambio los latinos son como Ariel, los anima el espritu,
son los hijos y descendientes del imperio romano y de la inmortal Atenas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como siempre, el mito estrangul la meta. Saltando sobre la realidad
histrica, olvidndonos de que, como descubri ms tarde Benito Mussolini,
los italianos de hoy no son descendientes de los romanos de Csar, los
latinoamericanos nos dedicamos a solazarnos en nuestra espiritualidad y a
maldecir al pujante yankee, el Mr. Danger de Rmulo Gallegos, que nos
despreciaba. En vez de aprender por qu el Norte era poderoso para, como
aconsejaba Sarmiento, encontrar el camino del xito, se nos ense que era
peligroso volvernos "materialistas", embijarnos con la industrializacin,
estudiar y adoptar urgentsimas reformas. Ariel, con su alada visin del
mundo, no tena que preocuparse de tales bajos menesteres, le bastaba
alimentarse de sueos y retrica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante tal desmesuramiento del mito de nuestra latinidad, se explica el
sarcasmo del peruano Manuel Gonzlez Prada:
<blockquote>"Aqu yace Carlos Oblongo,
de pura estirpe latina...
la madre lleg del Congo,
y el padre vino de China..."</blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las dos guerras mundiales, y la tajante realidad de un mundo dividido en
pueblos desarrollados y subdesarrollados, ayudaron a disipar algo el sueo
de la espiritualidad latina. Pero para entonces el mito haba contribuido al
dao colectivo. Nos habamos quedado a la zafa de la industrializacin. Y
dentro de nuestro hipottico mundo latino, masas empobrecidas reclamaban su
derecho al progreso.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a tal ineludible realidad, las minoras latinas revitalizaron tres
viejos mitos: la hermandad latinoamericana, el indigenismo, y la obligacin
del Estado de ser padre y protector de todos los ciudadanos. Los pases de
poblacin india cantaron al mestizaje, lo cual era bien justo, y proclamaron
la superioridad de las culturas precolombinas sobre la espaola, lo cual es
bien discutible. Y todos los gobiernos, dictaduras o democracias,
continuaron el paternalismo estatal, padre de parlisis y de corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ah est, entre muchos problemas, la corrupcin poltica que debilita y
mina todo esfuerzo. Y por qu no buscamos mtodos para embridarla? Con
cul mito vamos a encubrir nuestra responsabilidad colectiva?

<title>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA
</h2>
Luis Aguilar L.*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Me comentaban no hace mucho unos viajeros argentinos que el
presidente Menem est haciendo un vigoroso esfuerzo por podar las ramas de
la frondosa burocracia argentina. "Usted sabe", me decan "que hasta hace
poco conseguir un telfono en Buenos Aires era tan problemtico como viajar
a la luna". Claro que lo saba. En el Buenos Aires de antao la tardanza era
a veces tan dilatada que, cuando llegaba el telfono, era depositado
respetuosamente en la tumba del fallecido aplicante.
<p>
Las palabras no mitigaban mi escepticismo. La burocracia es como un ave
fnix que brota ms vigorosa de sus propias cenizas. Ahora, por ejemplo, ha
llegado la burocracia telefnica. Esa metlica voz invisible que, si uno
llama al hospital, le dice "si usted est grave apriete el dos, si ya se ha
muerto apriete el tres, que es la funeraria".
<p>
Es bueno recordar que la palabra "burocracia" tiene la misma raz latina
que "burla" y que "bur". Un burcrata es, por tanto, un seor que desde su
"bur" se burla de la gente que espera por su atencin. La especie, mucho
ms visible en los pases del Tercer Mundo, se extiende por todo el globo.
<p>
En el mundo socialista la burocracia asfixia. Siempre he mantenido que a la
Unin Sovitica la hundi una burocracia cada vez ms fuerte y un vodka cada
vez ms dbil. Por su parte, a Fidel Castro le humean las barbas cuando
habla de la burocracia cubana. "Aqu no se puede hacer nada sin firmar diez
mil papeles", grit una vez el lder iracundo. "Y cada vez que nombro una
comisin para erradicar el problema, la comisin crece, se expande y se suma
al monstruo burocrtico".
<p>
Conozco el caso de un brasileo que se cas en Sao Paulo con una
portuguesa. En esa poca la ley exiga que todos los documentos expedidos en
el extranjero tenan que ser traducidos por una institucin oficial.
Portugal no haba sido excluido. Como consecuencia, mi amigo tuvo que llevar
al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores todos los documentos de su futura
esposa para que fueran "oficialmente" traducidos del portugus al portugus.
<p>
En Espaa, el genial Wenceslao Fernndez Flores ilustraba la situacin con
un cuento travieso. Un da, un cientfico espaol descubri un mtodo
revolucionario de enlatar sardinas. Sabiendo que la exportacin de sardinas
era vital para Espaa, el inventor corri al Ministerio de Industria. Fue
recibido con la usual impasibilidad. Se le dijo que la aprobacin del
Ministerio de Economa era indispensable. All vol el anheloso inventor. Le
pidieron pruebas de la patente; lo enviaron a otros departamentos; le
exigieron sellos, firmas, declaraciones de planos y documentos de confirmacin.
<p>
Exasperado ante tales murallas de papel, con menos libras y ms canas, el
inventor retorn al Ministerio de Industria. "Pero es que ustedes no se dan
cuenta de que tengo en mis manos la prosperidad de Espaa?", se quej; "Es
que no se dan cuenta de que mientras aqu perdemos tiempo entre registros y
pruebas, algn extranjero puede descubrir la frmula y regalarle a su pas
la prosperidad que yo le ofrezco a Espaa?".
<p>
El empleado de turno no se inmut. "Clmese amigo. No lo tome a pecho. Aqu
todo requiere tiempo. Ve usted aquel viejito sentado en ese banco?". El
inventor le tir una ojeada a un venerable anciano de luengas barbas blancas
que fumaba plcidamente. "Pues bien", prosigui el empleado, "ese seor
descubri hace setenta aos cmo construir aviones de propulsin a chorro.
Era entonces un joven fogoso como usted y luch hasta el final. Hace diez
aos, el ministerio le otorg permiso de fabricacin. Claro que ya ni la
patente tiene sentido ni l se acuerda del invento, pero, despus de tantos
aos, sigue viniendo a visitarnos a fumar y a conversar. Este ministerio es
su casa".
<p>
Podra multiplicar ejemplos, hay algunos de una cierta delirante
originalidad. Como pasar por Guatemala cuando se inaugur el Ministerios de
Asuntos Especficos. Lo cual me dej pensando: qu tipo de asuntos se
tratan en otros ministerios, asuntos metafsicos? Pero prefiero terminar con
la aventura de un empresario en Francia.
<p>
Una vez, en Pars, un hombre de negocios norteamericano lleg jadeante y
presuroso a un ministerio de algo. Eran apenas las cuatro de la tarde y el
ministerio estaba desierto. "Qu es esto?", le pregunt atnito a un viejo
empleado que trapeaba lnguidamente los pisos. "Es que aqu no se trabaja
por las tardes?". Interrumpiendo su labor, y con una irona volteriana, el
francs le explic la situacin: "Aqu mon ami, los empleados no vienen por
la tarde y no trabajan por la maana... tu comprend?". Y prosigui su
metdica limpieza del piso.

<h2>
CAUSA COMUN DE LIBERALES Y CATOLICOS
</h2>

Manuel Ayau*

<P>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA  <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Las antiguas diferencias existentes entre la
Iglesia Catlica y los liberales en Amrica Latina siguen teniendo
resultados desastrosos. Hay alguna esperanza de reconciliacin? Pienso que s.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando a los 13 aos ingres a un colegio catlico interno en California,
me impresion la notable diferencia de los catlicos en Norteamrica. Quizs
el hecho que en el Nuevo Mundo hispnico el catolicismo gozaba de una
posicin predominante con respecto a otras religiones explicaba esa posicin
altanera y arrogante que no era el caso en Estados Unidos, donde al tratarse
de una minora era ms abierta y tolerante. Esa mayor tolerancia de los
catlicos anglosajones abarcaba tambin una filosofa econmica y poltica
ms liberal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, la Iglesia Catlica en Amrica Latina hered de Espaa un
prejuicio antiliberal y su antagonismo hacia el sistema capitalista, aunque
hay que aclarar que no hubo tal antagonismo contra los capitalistas mientras
estos formaban parte del sistema mercantilista, en el que la misma Iglesia
Catlica jugaba un papel protagnico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El mundo anglosajn tom el camino capitalista, alejndose del
mercantilismo criticado en lo moral y en lo econmico por Adam Smith,
provocando mejoras sin precedentes en las condiciones de la humanidad. Los
catlicos anglosajones se beneficiaron del liberalismo econmico y de la
Revolucin Industrial, mientras que en Estados Unidos el federalismo -que
significa la descentralizacin del poder y el libre comercio entre los
estados- represent la creacin del ms grande y duradero mercado comn de
la historia moderna. Es difcil ser anticapitalista con una experiencia tan
exitosa, aunque algunos sigan tratando. En el mundo anglosajn el trmino
liberal se asociaba con virtud y compasin, por lo que el apelativo fue
raptado por los defensores del colectivismo, del paternalismo y de la
sociedad irresponsable. Por el contrario, en el mundo hispano la palabra
liberal sonaba impa, anticlerical y mezquina.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A pesar de los esfuerzos del Papa Juan Pablo II, la alta jerarqua de la
Iglesia en Amrica Latina no ha hecho un esfuerzo sincero en comprender la
esencia de la controversia ni en dejar atrs las actitudes del pasado. Sus
acciones indican no estar interesados en un anlisis intelectual riguroso y
honesto, por lo que sigue prevaleciendo su condena generalizada contra todo
lo que suena a liberal o neoliberal. Hay excepciones, pero estas son ms
raras a medida que se sube en la jerarqua de la Iglesia, lo cual tiende a
alejar de ella a los catlicos liberales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como la mayora de la poblacin latinoamericana sigue hundida en la
pobreza, los sacerdotes deberan estudiar economa, comenzando con la
Escuela de Salamanca, para que sepan diferenciar entre el mercantilismo y el
capitalismo que ellos llaman, con desprecio, "neoliberalismo".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tan feliz como soy con la prosperidad creada por las privatizaciones y por
economas ms abiertas, me decepciona que la actual transicin hacia el
capitalismo es ms bien pragmtica, desposeda de principios ticos. La
palabra clave suele ser "eficiencia". Privatizar y desmonopolizar para
obtener mejor gerencia e ingresos fiscales, no como un acto de respeto hacia
los derechos de la gente de adquirir y vender su propiedad y de ejercer la
libertad de servir a los dems con su trabajo e ingenio. Abrir las fronteras
para hacer la economa ms eficiente, no en reconocimiento del derecho de
los ciudadanos a intercambiar lo que es suyo, sin tener que ver con dnde
viven los compradores o vendedores. Evitar la inflacin porque es
econmicamente ineficiente y no porque se trata de una prctica deshonesta
de los gobernantes. Llego a pensar que si el socialismo hubiera resultado
econmicamente eficiente todava seguira siendo respetable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo que todava muchos ignoran es que el mercado, como bien lo dijo Hayek,
se fundamenta en un sistema de reglas generales de justa conducta para
proteger los derechos individuales y el cumplimiento de contratos. Esa
generalizada desconfianza en el mercado se manifiesta en los intentos de
"regularlo", como si ya no estuviese regulado por reglas abstractas que
protegen la vida, la libertad y la propiedad. La bsqueda de un objetivo
comn es el camino a la reconciliacin entre catlicos liberales y
antiliberales. Todos aspiramos a una sociedad ms virtuosa, caritativa y
responsable, a una sociedad moral y antimercantilista.&copy; <p>

DESTELLO DE LIBERTAD

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- La noche del 11 de abril, Lady Thatcher fue la oradora
durante la celebracin del 50 aniversario de la Fundacin para la Educacin
Econmica (FEE) en el Waldorf-Astoria. Prcticamente todos los defensore del
libre mercado, los derechos de propiedad y la libertad individual alrededor
del mundo han sido influenciados por la labor pionera de Leonard Read
(1898-1983) y por FEE, la institucin por l fundada en 1946 para promover
la libertad, incrementar la comprensin pblica de la economa de mercado y
reconocer lo perverso y nocivo de la intervencin gubernamental.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Read naci en una granja en Michigan y deca que su entrenamiento
econmico comenz a los ocho aos: "Mi padre me puso a ordear vacas desde
temprana edad y as aprend la relacin entre el trabajo y un litro de
leche. Todo lo dems en economa son aditamentos a esa leccin bsica".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando Read era director ejecutivo de la Cmara de Comercio ms grande de
Estados Unidos, en Los Angeles, invit al profesor Ludwig von Mises a dar
una serie de conferencias en 1944. Mises pensaba que lo que "realmente
importa es el resultado de la lucha intelectual entre los partidarios del
socialismo y los del capitalismo". En 1946, Mises ingres a FEE, dictando
conferencias anuales a maestros, periodistas y estudiantes en la sede de
Irvington-on-Hudson.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La libertad siempre es una vctima de la guerra. Entonces la
"reconstruccin" estaba siendo planificada por los nuevos burcratas
internacionales. Las virtudes del Estado Bienestar, del Plan Marshall, de
los controles de precios y salarios se debatan apasionadamente. Mi primer
viaje a Estados Unidos fue en 1945; adems del Empire State, lo que ms me
impresion fue que mi madre no poda comprar zapatos sin un cupn del
gobierno y que a pap le servan su caf con una diminuta bolsita de azcar.
Yo era demasiado joven para darme cuenta que el racionamiento y la escasez
son los resultados inevitables del control gubernamental sobre la economa
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El ao anterior, Friedrich von Hayek haba publicado "Camino de
servidumbre", mostrando que la barbarie es la consecuencia no intencional
del fascismo, del comunismo y de la social democracia. Esa obra marc el
renacimiento del liberalismo clsico y tuvo gran influencia en Estados Unidos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard Read fue uno del selecto grupo de intelectuales invitados por Hayek
a reunirse en la aldea suiza de Mont Pelerin, en abril de 1947, donde se
fund una sociedad para unir los entonces desperdigados esfuerzos por la
libertad. Seis miembros de FEE asistieron a esa conferencia y se
convertiran en frecuentes colaboradores de la revista The Freeman. Adems
de Hayek, Mises y Read, otros distinguidos economistas, politlogos y
periodistas estuvieron en Mont Pelerin: Karl Popper, Milton Friedman, Lionel
Robbins, George Stigler, Fritz Machlup, Henry Hazzlitt, F.A. Harper,
Bertrand de Jouvenel, W. Rpke, Frank Knight, Walter Eucken, Aaron Director,
John Davenport, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Read, FEE y su revista tuvieron una extraordinaria influencia en el
surgimiento de instituciones liberales por todo nuestro hemisferio,
especialmente en la Argentina, Mxico y Guatemala. Alberto Benegas Lynch,
presidente de la Cmara de Comercio de Buenos Aires, conoci a Read, Mises y
Hayek durante un viaje a Nueva York en 1950. Benegas, quien a los 86 aos
sigue siendo un incansable luchador por la libertad, fund en 1957 el Centro
de Estudios sobre la Libertad y una revista similar a la de FEE. Su hijo
Alberto recibi en 1968 una beca de FEE para completar su tesis de doctorado
en Estados Unidos y hoy es director de la Escuela Superior de Economa y
Administracin en Buenos Aires.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alejandro Chafun es otro de varios argentinos becados por FEE. Se cas y
se qued a vivir en Estados Unidos, conociendo a Sir Antony Fisher, fundador
del Institute of Economic Affairs en Londres, la institucin que hizo
posible la revolucin thatcheriana en Inglaterra. Sir Antony haba visitado
FEE en 1952, quedando impresionado por la forma de popularizar la economa
de mercado, a travs de programas educacionales. Despus de fundar lo que
hoy es el Manhattan Institute, Sir Antony estableci el Atlas Economic
Research Foundation para apoyar la labor de instituciones liberales por todo
el mundo. Chafun es hoy presidente de Atlas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FEE tambin sirvi de modelo a los pioneros liberales en Mxico: Luis
Montes de Oca, Gustavo Velasco y Agustn Navarro, fundadores del Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Econmicas, financiado principalmente por Hugo
Salinas Rocha. Montes de Oca haba sido Secretario de Hacienda y presidente
del Banco Central. Velasco, profesor de leyes, era presidente de la
Asociacin Bancaria, mientras que Navarro era el ms distinguido periodista
independiente, cuando el PRI ejerca su frreo control sobre la prensa y el
suministro de papel. Ellos invitaron a Mises a Mxico en 1942, 1946, 1949 y
1958. Hoy, Agustn Navarro hijo escribe una columna semanal para AIPE y es
presidente del Centro Mises. El nieto de Salinas, Roberto Salinas Len, es
director ejecutivo del Centro de Estudios sobre la Libre Empresa y en enero
de este ao organiz la primera reunin de la Sociedad Mont Pelerin
realizada en Mxico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La directiva de FEE y Lady Thatcher entregaron durante la ceremonia del 50
aniversario una medalla a Manuel Ayau, de Guatemala, fundador en 1972 de la
Universidad Francisco Marroqun. Sus 12.000 estudiantes, no importa la
carrera, deben completar una instruccin bsica en economa para graduarse.
Segn Ayau, "el xito debe depender de lo bien que se complazca a los
consumidores en el mercado y no de complacer al gobierno la labor de los
amantes de la libertad est en la lucha contra el privilegio".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Durante medio siglo FEE ha cambiado nuestras vidas promoviendo la libertad
en nuestro hemisferio y ms all.

<h2>
EL SUICIDIO DE UN ALMIRANTE
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<P>
MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Algo anda muy mal, cuando se pega un tiro el comandante en
jefe de operaciones navales de Estados Unidos, responsable por un milln de
uniformados. Los debiluchos de carcter e inseguros de s mismo no alcanzan
esas posiciones y el historial del almirante Jeremy (Mike) Boorda indica
todo lo contrario. Se trataba de un hombre excepcional, el primero en la
armada de este pas que comenz como simple recluta para alcanzar la ms
alta posicin de las fuerzas navales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La noticia del jueves 16 de mayo fue que el almirante de 57 aos se haba
suicidado en su casa, dejando una corta nota dirigida "a los marineros",
cuyo texto no ha sido todava revelado. La razn dada fue el acoso
periodstico por parte de la revista Newsweek que cuestionaba la utilizacin
de dos diminutas letras "v" (por valor en combate) en un par de
condecoraciones de Vietnam, cuando Boorda tena el rango de teniente. En
efecto, esa tarde estaba pactada la entrevista -nunca efectuada- con un
reportero de la revista en su despacho, pero se debe aclarar que su
comandante en Vietnam, el almirante Elmo Zumwalt, afirm que Mike Boorda s
tena derecho a lucir esas condecoraciones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata del ms dramtico acontecimiento en una escalada de ataques contra
la naval que comenz con la ya famosa convencin Tailhook de aviadores de la
armada en 1991, donde luego de seminarios y conferencias sobre temas navales
un grupo de oficiales de ambos sexos terminaron en borracheras y orgas. El
escndalo fue magnificado por las fuerzas feministas que consideran la
cultura de "hombres machos" que predomina en la naval como algo con lo cual
hay que terminar, de manera que las mujeres puedan gozar de algn tipo de
"accin afirmativa" dentro de la armada que les asegure compartir las ms
altas posiciones en responsabilidad y en combate. Las feministas
consiguieron todo el apoyo de las altas esferas polticas en Washington, lo
cual convirti un incidente lamentable en la mayor derrota sufrida por la
marina de Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra, costndole la carrera a
docenas de distinguidos oficiales a quienes ni siquiera se les comprob
haber tomado parte en la fiesta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una de las vctimas de Tailhook fue el antecesor del almirante Boorda, a
quin se oblig a adelantar su jubilacin. Se trat de una cacera de
brujas, donde los condenados no tuvieron la oportunidad de defenderse y la
hoja de servicio de valientes oficiales que dieron los mejores aos de su
vida a la defensa de la patria fue emborronada y destruida por las fuerzas
predominantes de la "poltica correcta", para quienes ser homosexual es "un
estilo de vida", pero silbarle a una mujer bonita es imperdonable.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dos de los hijos y una nuera del almirante Boorda son oficiales navales.
John Lehman, Secretario de la Naval en tiempos de Reagan, mantiene que Mike
Boorda fue "acorralado y linchado por una turba". Lo preocupante es que
muchos de aquellos sucios y melenudos pacifistas de los aos 60 hoy tienen
cargos claves en el gobierno del presidente Bill Clinton, quien en su
juventud presuma de "odiar" a los militares. Segn Lehman, los que hasta
hace unos das difamaban al almirante Boorda son los mismos que antes
alababan la economa sovitica, culpaban a Estados Unidos de la Guerra Fra
y despotricaban contra los esfuerzos del presidente Reagan en construir la
armada ms efectiva y poderosa de la historia de la humanidad, capaz de
mantener la paz.&copy;<p>

BENEFICENCIA CORPORATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina no nos sorprende encontrar a empresarios
que defienden fervientemente la economa de mercado, siempre y cuando no se
aplique a sus negocios; pero s  exigen todas las ventajas y todos los
privilegios que tradicionalmente han recibido de sus contactos polticos.
Pues resulta que en la gran democracia del norte la forma es algo ms
circunspecta, pero el fondo es muy parecido.
<dd>	El gobierno de Estados Unidos gasta $75.000 millones en subsidiar a
empresas privadas a travs de 125 programas federales diferentes. El gran
debate poltico sobre la necesidad de equilibrar el presupuesto se ha
concentrado en examinar programas sociales que han crecido a una velocidad
de varias veces el aumento poblacional y de la inflacin, pero poco se habla
de la beneficencia corporativa, cuando su eliminacin reducira a la mitad
el dficit fiscal.
<dd>	La beneficencia corporativa se puede definir como la concesin de favores y
beneficios, por parte del gobierno, a empresas especficas y, al igual de lo
que sucede en Amrica Latina, los beneficiarios no suelen ser firmas
diminutas que tratan de sobrevivir sino muchas de las ms grandes y
poderosas. La beneficencia corporativa tiene mltiples formas:
transferencias directas de fondos, prstamos blandos (a tasas subsidiadas de
inters y a largo plazo), seguro de inversiones y de exportaciones a pases
riesgosos, subsidios, barreras a importaciones para proteger ciertas
industrias que de otra forma no podran competir (aumentndole el costo de
esos productos y servicios a los estadounidenses), ventajas impositivas (con
reduccin de impuestos o aceleracin de la depreciacin permitida), etc.
<dd>	El ambiente de corrupcin generado por la beneficencia corporativa es parte
integral del mal. Ha sido comprobado que muchas de las empresas beneficiadas
por programas tales como el de Tecnologa Avanzada y el Programa de
Reinversin Tecnolgica fueron tambin las que aportaron las ms grandes
contribuciones a la campaa electoral del presidente Clinton. Otras
empresas, como Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) aporta millones de dlares en
contribuciones a candidatos de ambos partidos polticos y tales
contribuciones han coincidido con subsidios a ADM por valor de cientos de
millones de dlares en los ltimos 25 aos. Hay algo indudablemente podrido
cuando los impuestos pagados por ciudadanos comunes se canalizan para
aumentar las ganancias empresariales.
<dd>	De esta manera el gobierno premia no a las empresas que mejor sirven al
consumidor sino a las que son ms hbiles en el campo poltico. Una relacin
descriptiva de la beneficencia corporativa estadounidense no cabra en la
edicin de hoy de este peridico. Entre las joyas: El programa azucarero
concede ms de un milln de dlares al ao a cada una de las 33 plantaciones
ms grandes de azcar, a la vez que duplica el costo interno del azcar. El
Programa de Promocin de Mercado del Departamento de Agricultura  ha pagado
ms de $50 millones en publicidad en el extranjero de los vinos de
California. El Programa de Tecnologa Avanzada le da casi $500 millones
anuales a empresas como Xerox, Caterpillar y General Electric como subsidio
a sus investigaciones y desarrollo de nuevos productos. La agencia de
Inversiones Privadas en Ultramar gasta $58 millones al ao asegurando las
exportaciones e inversiones en el exterior de empresas como Coca Cola y
General Electric.
<dd>	El centro neurlgico de la beneficencia corporativa en este pas es el
Departamento de Comercio, un ministerio que muchos jvenes congresistas
quieren eliminar. Tambin importante es el Departamento de Agricultura,
ministerio cuyo personal ha crecido geomtricamente a medida de que se
reduce el nmero de agricultores en el pas. El problema es que cuando esos
mismos jvenes congresistas aspiren a ser reelegidos, los ms dispuestos a
aportar fondos a sus campaas sern las mismas empresas y grupos de presin
que reciben el grueso de los beneficios magnnimamente concedidos por el
gobierno. Nada nuevo bajo el Sol. &copy

<h2>POLITIZACION Y CORRUPCION DE LA JUSTICIA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- De todas las plagas que han acosado a Amrica Latina en los
ltimos aos, la ms funesta ha sido la creciente politizacin de nuestros
sistemas judiciales, lo cual a su vez ha fomentado la corrupcin. Si la ley
no es respetable, no se acata y surge el caos.
<dd>	Es un fenmeno regional que a medida que nuestros pases se fueron
democratizando, mientras los dictadores y caudillos iban siendo desplazados
por gobiernos democrticamente electos, el nombramiento de jueces comenz a
hacerse en funcin de afiliaciones y tendencias partidistas, lo cual al
transcurrir de los aos se ha degenerado en el desprestigio de la
institucin y su exposicin a la manipulacin poltica o a la descarada
venta de fallos y sentencias al mejor postor.
<dd>	Otra influencia extraordinariamente negativa es que las ms poderosas
multinacionales que operan hoy en Amrica Latina no son ya las viejas United
Fruit y Standard Oil Company sino los carteles del narcotrfico. Y gracias a
la poltica de Washington de declarar la guerra a la fabricacin y al
transporte ms que al consumo de las drogas, el campo de batalla fue
trasladado a nuestros pases, donde el sueldo mensual de un polica o de un
juez equivale a lo que gana diariamente un vendedor al detal de drogas en
las calles de Nueva York o Los Angeles.
<dd>	Sin seguridad jurdica no puede florecer la inversin ni la creacin de
empleos. La apertura econmica en pases como Mxico, Venezuela y hasta
cierto punto Argentina, donde las privatizaciones beneficiaron
principalmente a aquellos cercanos al poder, no genera la prosperidad
general y altos niveles de empleo que rpidamente se traducen en apoyo
electoral a las reformas econmicas. Por el contrario, surgen violentas
oleadas contra el mal llamado neoliberalismo que en su versin
latinoamericana tiende slo a beneficiar a elites polticas y empresariales,
al terminar pagando el pueblo ms por los bienes y servicios de las viejas
empresas estatales ahora convertidas en monopolios privados, mientras el
producto de las privatizaciones se aplica a mantener burocracias excesivas,
a campaas electorales y a cuentas particulares de los gobernantes y sus
familiares en el extranjero.
<dd>	En Venezuela se desat una cnica persecucin poltica contra los banqueros
"prfugos" de la justicia. Entre ellos hay unos cuantos gngsters bien
conocidos, pero tambin entre esos 400 que les han dictado autos de
detencin hay muchos que no eran responsables, cometieron pecados veniales o
equivocaciones, pero que obviamente no tienen ninguna fe en un proceso
judicial totalmente politizado. Todos fueron metidos en la misma canasta
ante la desesperacin del gobierno de Caldera de encontrar culpables de la
debacle venezolana y en su campaa por desprestigiar al "capitalismo" y la
reforma econmica iniciada por Carlos Andrs Prez.
<dd>	Por otra parte, me contaba recientemente un alto ejecutivo de una
multinacional en Buenos Aires, quien antes ocup una posicin similar en
Caracas, que la corrupcin del sector privado en la Argentina est mucho ms
generalizada que en Venezuela porque para cerrar ventas importantes a otras
empresas hay que pagarles comisiones a los gerentes de compras. Es decir, el
sector privado all ya fue contagiado por las prcticas del sector pblico.
<dd>	La trascendencia del Imperio de la Ley y de la seguridad jurdica la expuso
F. W. Maitland hace ms de un siglo al escribir: "El ejercicio del poder en
forma imprevisible origina alguna de las mayores limitaciones, pues la
limitacin, cuanto menos previsible, es mayor y ms temida. Nos sentimos
menos libres cuando sabemos que en cualquier momento y sobre cualquiera de
nuestras acciones puede recaer una limitacin, y, sin embargo, no podemos
prever tales limitaciones Las reglas conocidas, por muy malas que sean,
interfieren menos con la libertad que las decisiones basadas en reglas que
no son previamente conocidas". 
<dd>	Cuando las decisiones judiciales y la interpretacin de las leyes se hacen
en funcin de los intereses polticos del momento, la supuesta libertad
poltica se convierte en un gran engao y la gente comienza a echar de menos
los mejores tiempos que se vivan bajo algn autcrata, cuando al menos
estaba claro lo que se poda o no hacer y el crculo de privilegios era
mucho ms reducido. &copy

<TITLE>Ball: Por Fin Arranca Dole -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>POR FIN ARRANCA DOLE</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El 5 de agosto en Chicago, el candidato republicano Bob Dole
comenz su discurso anunciando su plan de crecimiento econmico de la
siguiente forma: "Es estupendo estar aqu. Estupendo poder dar este discurso
antes que Bill Clinton obtenga una copia y trate de darlo l". Clara manera
de decir que desde que comenz la campaa el presidente Clinton, con
habilidad de camalen, se ha apoderado de una tras otra bandera republicana.
<dd>	
La ms importantes de esas banderas hasta la fecha haba sido la reforma de
la beneficencia pblica, ante el fracaso de una billonaria poltica que
lejos de sacar de la pobreza a los ms desdichados ha institucionalizado la
dependencia, creando consecutivas generaciones de personas que no trabajan y
de nias solteras teniendo hijos. La decisin de traspasar el dinero y la
responsabilidad a los estados, a la vez de la imposicin de un lmite mximo
de por vida de cinco aos en la dependencia de la caridad pblica significa
la aceptacin de una doctrina antagnica a la filosofa de la izquierda
estadounidense, hasta ahora consentida por la administracin Clinton. Es
ms, al presidente anunciar que no vetara -como antes lo hizo- la reforma
de la beneficencia propuesta por los republicanos, ello motiv a muchos
congresistas demcratas a apoyarla tambin, conscientes de la proximidad de
elecciones legislativas en noviembre y de que el pas entero se ha movido a
la derecha.
<dd>	
En su discurso, Dole agarr y corri con la bandera que mejor define a los
republicanos: bajos impuestos como camino hacia un gobierno ms pequeo y
limitado. Continu diciendo: "este es un discurso que Bill Clinton jams
podr dar". Y resumi su programa as:<ul>
<li>Equilibrar el presupuesto.
<li>Reducirle el peso de los impuestos a la clase media.
<li>Proveer nuevas oportunidades educativas a los americanos.
<li>Reformar el sistema fracturado de litigios y demandas.
<li>Acabar con regulaciones federales innecesarias.
<li>Y restaurar la promesa del sueo americano.
</ul><dd>	
Dole dijo que los americanos son corredores olmpicos con un peso de 50
libras en las piernas y ya es tiempo de deshacernos de cadenas y grilletes,
haciendo referencia a las mltiples ataduras impuestas por el gobierno.
Segn Dole, la "clintoeconoma" ha aplastado la clase media con altos
impuestos y bajo crecimiento.
<dd>	
As como en Amrica Latina los polticos tratan de ganarse a los pobres,
que son mayora, en este pas el grueso del voto est en la clase media y
las estadsticas favorecen a Dole porque desde que Clinton ocupa la Casa
Blanca los ingresos del gobierno federal han aumentado en $322.000 millones
(29%) y la recaudacin de impuestos federales por cada persona aument a
$5.365 o 25% desde 1992. En ese mismo perodo el ingreso por trabajador
aument slo en 10%. Dole afirma que es "increble que la familia ahora
gasta ms en impuestos que en el total por alimentos, ropa y vivienda".
<dd>	
Las medidas concretas que propone incluyen una reduccin general de 15% (en
tres aos) en las tasas de impuesto personal. Un crdito fiscal de $500 por
cada nio menor de 18 aos. Reduccin de 50% del impuesto de ganancias de
capital (de 28% a 14%) para motivar la reinversin en las pequeas empresas
que aportan tres de cada cuatro nuevos empleos. Ampliacin de las cuentas
individuales de pensiones, libres de impuestos para que la gente ahorre ms.
Y, por ltimo, insistir que el Congreso imponga una super mayora de 60%
para cualquier futuro aumento de impuestos.
<dd>
Promete no descansar hasta que todo el sistema impositivo sea reemplazado
por uno ms simple, ms justo y ms plano. Dole dijo que hoy la  opresiva
oficina del impuesto es el doble de grande que la CIA y cinco veces ms
grande que el FBI. Cumplir con las leyes impositivas requiere el trabajo a
tiempo completo de casi tres millones de personas, ms que todos los
miembros de las fuerzas armadas. "Soy optimista, creo que los funcionarios
del impuesto pueden ser entrenados para que hagan cosas provechosas... y
comenzar pasando la carga de las pruebas a los fiscales para de nuevo
presumir la inocencia de los ciudadanos hasta que se compruebe lo contrario
acabar con las auditoras tipo KGB mi administracin liberar a los
americanos de la tirana de los impuestos el objetivo es crear un
crecimiento econmico de 3,5% o ms al ao y la historia muestra que los
recortes de impuestos estimulan el crecimiento y aumentan la recaudacin".
Dole termin su discurso citando a Winston Churchill, pero oigo ms bien un
eco de las  propuestas de Steve Forbes, a quien duramente combati en las
primarias.
<dd>
Es difcil confiar en los polticos y los de Estados Unidos no son muy
diferentes. Bush prometi no aumentar los impuestos y Clinton prometi
rebajarlos. Ninguno de los dos cumpli su palabra. Pero indudablemente que
Bob Dole por fin ha logrado obtener la atencin del electorado; la campaa
se vuelve interesante y ms importante an que el nombramiento del candidato
republicano a la vicepresidencia sera que se designara a Steve Forbes como
secretario del Tesoro. Pase lo que pase fue l quien coloc a los impuestos
en el tapete. <p>

<TITLE>Ball: Jack Kemp -- 9/04/96</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>JACK KEMP</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A mis aos pensaba que ya no me entusiasmara ningn poltico
y menos una campaa presidencial. Pero he tenido dos sorpresas en 1996.
Primero con Steve Forbes y ahora con la candidatura de Jack Kemp a la
vicepresidencia, la cual ha mejorado radicalmente las probabilidades de que
Bob Dole sea el prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca.<p>
	Cuando oigo hablar a los polticos, siempre me pregunto en qu me estn
tratando de engaar? Kemp y media docena de otros, como John McCain y Dick
Armey, son las excepciones. Kemp habla con el corazn y mirando a los ojos.
Cuando en medio de la Convencin Republicana en San Diego abraz y bes a su
hijo -quien lo present-, pareca que estbamos viendo a un padre latino
besando a su hijo de mediana edad en pblico.<p>
	En enero de 1995, Kemp anunci que no buscara la nominacin presidencial
de su partido para las elecciones de 1996. Las nuevas reglas de
financiamiento electoral obligan a los candidatos a dedicarse de lleno a
conseguir decenas de miles de pequeos contribuyentes, algo que le
disgustaba y, adems, todava estaba pagando las deudas incurridas en su
anterior intento. Dos meses ms tarde, en marzo de 1995, fue nombrado por
Bob Dole y Newt Gingrich presidente de la Comisin Nacional sobre
Crecimiento Econmico y Reforma Impositiva para estudiar la mejor manera de
reestructurar el sistema de impuestos, del cual todo el mundo se queja y que
ha sido no slo la principal fuente de corrupcin poltica sino el mayor
freno a la prosperidad y al crecimiento.<p>
	Jack Kemp no es el nico poltico estadounidense consciente de la necesidad
de retomar el camino del crecimiento econmico para que "la marea" levante
el nivel de vida de todos los ciudadanos, como sucedi aqu en los aos 50,
60 y 80. Pero Kemp s es el nico de ese grupo que es percibido por la
generalidad de los votantes como alguien realmente preocupado por los
pobres, por los habitantes de los barrios, por los inmigrantes y las minoras.<p>
	Hay cierto aire artificial cuando algunos de los principales lderes del
Partido Republicano se acercan a las comunidades latinas de Los Angeles y
Chicago o a los barrios negros de Detroit y Miami. Eso no sucede con Kemp.
El no est all por ganar puntos; sinceramente est en activa bsqueda de la
mejor manera de resolver los problemas que confrontan los ms dbiles de la
sociedad. Como Secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano, bajo Bush,
introdujo el concepto de las Zonas Emprendedoras para promover -con bajos
impuestos- la creacin de empresas y de empleos en los barrios pobres de las
grandes ciudades, a la vez que fomentaba el traspaso de la propiedad de
apartamentos de los proyectos residenciales del gobierno a manos de los
inquilinos, sabiendo que al convertirlos en propietarios de su vivienda
adquiran la dignidad y confianza conducentes a romper las cadenas de la
dependencia en la beneficencia pblica.<p>
	Sobre la inmigracin, Kemp dijo el 18 de febrero de este ao: "Tenemos que
comprender que estamos obteniendo algunos de los mejores y ms brillantes
cerebros de todo el mundo para que inviertan sus talentos en la economa
estadounidense. Nos estamos volviendo ms competitivos y ms prsperos y,
en el proceso, no estamos desplazando ni devaluando a trabajadores americanos".<p>
	Luego de una casi total concentracin del esfuerzo de los republicanos en
equilibrar el presupuesto federal, lo cual es importante pero no enciende el
entusiasmo de los electores, Kemp (y su discpulo Forbes) argumentaron que
el dficit es la consecuencia de un mal mayor. No podemos conformarnos con
los actuales niveles mediocres de crecimiento econmico, 2 a 2,5% anual,
cuando a raz de las rebajas de impuestos de Kennedy, el crecimiento entre
1960 y 1964 alcanz 4,7% anual, y luego de las rebajas impositivas de
Reagan, el crecimiento anual promedi 3,1% de 1981 a 1988. <p>
	Kemp aspira que el Plan Dole, al cual tanto l como Gary Becker
contribuyeron, conduzca a un crecimiento de 3,5%, lo cual doblara el tamao
de la economa de Estados Unidos para el ao 2008.<p>
	En sus propias palabras: "La inmensa burocracia gubernamental que
soportamos fue creada durante los ltimos 60 aos con buenas intenciones,
pero con una filosofa redistributiva que condujo a resultados
contraproducentes. Dando la cara a esa realidad, los republicanos cometemos
un grave error cuando tratamos de ahorrar primero en los programas sociales.
Eso permite que se nos acuse de poner la carreta de la austeridad fiscal
antes que el caballo de crecimiento econmico rpido".<p>
	Kemp, adems, tiene una visin mundial que ha brillado por su ausencia bajo
Clinton y Gore, quienes han tratado de pasar responsabilidades y liderazgo a
las Naciones Unidas, con consecuencias lamentables. Luego de la Primera
Guerra, Estados Unidos le dio la espalda al mundo y sus leyes
proteccionistas aunadas a polticas monetarias constrictivas convirtieron
una recesin en la Gran Depresin que no termin sino con la Segunda Guerra.
Luego de esta ltima predomin la apertura al mundo y la expansin econmica
que condujo al triunfo en la Guerra Fra. Cuatro aos ms de Clinton, con su
desidia hacia todo lo extranjero, podra repetir los dolorosos sucesos de
los aos 30 y terminar de enterrar la visin de Reagan y Bush sobre un
continente americano integrado econmicamente, bajo un floreciente
capitalismo democrtico.<p>
	Aquellos que menosprecian la posicin de la vicepresidencia no ven que ella
colocara a Jack Kemp en el lugar clave para aspirar a la presidencia en el
ao 2000, lo cual me convierte en optimista acerca del nuevo milenio. <p>

<i>October 09, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
VIENA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  Mi anterior viaje a Viena fue en 1968, cuando los venezolanos
viajbamos con una moneda dura por todo el mundo. Entonces me hosped en el
Hotel Imperial, quiz el ms bello de todos los hoteles clsicos europeos,
donde uno abre los ojos por la maana admirando increbles frescos en el
techo de la habitacin y se tira de un cordn detrs de la cama para que a
los pocos segundos aparezca un mesonero de levita preguntando qu apetece
para el desayuno.
<P>
 Los rusos ocuparon a Austria hasta 1955, pero esta capital del viejo
imperio no ha logrado despertar de un largo letargo socialista que sigue
predominando junto al fro y hmedo otoo. Se trata de un socialismo menos
ineficiente que los del Caribe: el tranva que tomo cada maana para asistir
a las conferencias de la Sociedad Mont Plerin (fundada por Hayek hace 49
aos) funciona con limpieza y precisin alemana, y jams me han pedido el
boleto porque las autoridades asumen que lo compr. Me imagino que el pasaje
est altamente subsidiado porque con 20 chelines austracos -unos dos
dlares americanos- puedo hacer todos los viajes que quiera durante un da.
Por el contrario, tomarse un caf o comerse una deliciosa torta de chocolate
es una inversin que amerita cierta reflexin previa. Adems, cualquier cosa
que uno coma lleva un impuesto de 10% y lo que se bebe 20%.
<P> 
Los economistas que miden el nivel de vida de los pueblos le asignan los
primeros puestos al Japn, Suiza y Alemania sin tomar en cuenta los precios.
El japons de clase media vive en un apartamento poco ms grande que el
clset de un hogar americano y la ama de casa alemana tiene que comprar
alimentos todos los das porque su nevera es ms o menos del tamao del
televisor que ocupa un lugar de honor en el "family room" estadounidense.
 Mi impresin de Viena se repite: una gran capital sin mucho pas para
sostenerla; edificaciones ms fastuosas que las de Pars o Londres, pero
donde predomina una triste nostalgia por el irrepetible esplendor de fines
del siglo XIX, algo no padecido con la misma intensidad en otras capitales
de viejos imperios. Me qued en casa de un pariente noble de amigos
argentinos, el palacio del prncipe Kinsky, una impresionante mansin
barroca del siglo XVIII en el centro de la ciudad, lo cual por unos das me
ha permitido asomarme a esa esplendorosa poca que termin con el retumbar
de los caones, en agosto de 1914.
<P>
 Con Carl Menger naci en Viena, en 1871, la economa moderna o neoclsica.
Fue el fundador de la escuela austraca, seguido por su brillante discpulo
Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk en la ctedra de economa de la Universidad de Viena.
El rostro de Bhm-Bawerk ilustra hoy los billetes de cien chelines. Estos
economistas austracos centraron sus investigaciones en las motivaciones del
individuo y en la forma cmo este acta en reaccin a sus propias
motivaciones, preferencias y valoraciones. Esas preferencias del consumidor
a su vez impulsan y ordenan la actividad productora de bienes y servicios,
conduciendo a los inversionistas hacia la ptima utilizacin de los
recursos. Tambin concluyeron que gastos en mano de obra y materiales no
confieren valor a los productos y servicios, sino que su valor procede
exclusivamente de las apreciaciones del consumidor. 
<P>
Estos economistas vieneses se dieron cuenta que cuanto mayor es la cantidad
de un producto menor es el valor que se le atribuye a cada unidad. Por ello
el agua y el pan son baratos, mientras que el oro y los brillantes son caros. 
 Ludwig von Mises ingres al seminario de Bhm-Bawerk en el ao 1900 y luego
procedi a avanzar la teora econmica indicando que el "precio" del dinero
(su poder adquisitivo) es determinado por el mercado en la misma forma que
se determina el precio de cualquier otro bien, en funcin de la cantidad
disponible. La gente gasta rpidamente cualquier moneda que pierde su valor
y ahorra en otra moneda que lo mantiene.
<P> 
Una estupenda ancdota de Mises se refiere a la consulta que le hicieron
durante la violenta inflacin que sobrevino en Austria luego de la Primera
Guerra. Cuando le preguntaron cmo remediarla, Mises insisti que se
encontraran con l a la medianoche en una calle de Viena. A esa hora y
rodeado de altos funcionarios dijo: "oyen ese ruido?... es la imprenta del
Banco Central imprimiendo billetes... prenla".
<P> 
No conoc a Mises, pero s a su alumno Friedrich A. von Hayek y en esta
visita a Viena convers con su hijo Laurence y su nuera Esca. No voy a
tratar de describir la obra de Hayek en un prrafo pero si algo lo defini
fue su fiel creencia en el poder de las ideas, lo cual caracteriza al
liberalismo mismo. Hayek mantena que lo que est conscientemente presente
en la mente de un hombre es apenas una diminuta parte de las ideas en que
basa su manera de pensar, de lo cual surge lo que llam "el orden
espontneo" que es la consecuencia imprevista del accionar independiente de
millones de individuos. En sus propias palabras: "sera un error  creer que
para alcanzar un grado ms alto de civilizacin tenemos simplemente que
instrumentar las ideas que ahora nos guan. Si vamos a avanzar, tenemos que
dejar espacio a una continua revisin de nuestros actuales conceptos e
ideales".
<P> 
Los palacios, museos, monumentos y estatuas de Viena nos recuerdan las
batallas y glorias del pasado, pero son Mises y Hayek quienes representan la
victoria de las ideas liberales en nuestro siglo, triunfantes frente al
cruel socialismo estatista y la empobrecedora planificacin central. Para mi
son ellos el ms grandioso legado de Viena. &copy;

<title>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA -- 11/14/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Un taciturno economista escocs de 60 aos -James Mirrless-,
profesor de la Universidad de Cambridge y otro de 82 aos -William Vickrey-,
profesor emrito de la Universidad de Columbia, quienes nunca se conocieron,
fueron conjuntamente los ganadores este ao del Premio Nobel de economa.
Vickrey, el primer canadiense que lo gana, muri el viernes 11 de octubre de
un infarto, apenas tres das despus de haber sido anunciado su galardn.
<p>
El premio, que conlleva una bolsa de $1,120.000, fue concedido por la Real
Academia Sueca de las Ciencias por el trabajo pionero de ambos en el
desarrollo "de la teora econmica de incentivos bajo informacin
asimtrica". Esto, que suena muy complicado, tiene que ver con las
decisiones econmicas que se toman cuando las partes no tienen la misma
informacin. Por ejemplo, cuando alguien pide prestado al banco, esa persona
conoce mucho mejor su habilidad de pagar el crdito que el banquero que
decidir prestar o no. Tambin, quien compra una pliza de vida sabe ms de
su propia salud que la empresa de seguro.
<p>
Esta asimetra de informacin tiene como consecuencia que el que ms sabe
aprovecha para explotar estratgicamente su mayor conocimiento. La
investigacin sobre la economa de la informacin se ha concentrado en
generar una mayor comprensin de los mercados de seguros, de crditos, las
subastas, los sistemas de impuestos, las instituciones polticas, etc. 
<p>
Ambos economistas han hecho importantes contribuciones al estudio de los
impuestos, buscando que las recaudaciones distorsionen lo menos posible los
incentivos al trabajo y al ahorro. El profesor Mirrlees, quien fue asesor
del Partido Laborista ingls, favoreca la redistribucin de la riqueza, a
travs del sistema impositivo. En 1971, cuando la tasa tope del impuesto
ingls era 83%, con la ayuda de un complejo modelo matemtico se propuso
identificar una tasa impositiva ptima que maximizara la productividad y el
esfuerzo de la gente. Mirrless no slo encontr que la tasa impositiva
debera ser 20% sino que esa debera ser aplicada por igual a todo el mundo.
El primer sorprendido fue l mismo, declarando: "Debo confesar que esperaba
que un riguroso anlisis del impuesto sobre la renta en forma utilitaria me
dara argumentos en apoyo de altas tasas impositivas. Pero no ha sido as".
<p>
Vickrey, por su parte, mantena que los impuestos no deberan desincentivar
a la gente en  producir un dlar adicional de ganancia porque si dejan de
hacerlo el gobierno no recaudar ningn impuesto sobre ese dlar de riqueza
que nunca se lleg a producir.
<p>
En 1964, Vickrey escribi: "Sigue siendo un hecho que las ganancias
producidas por el trabajo estn sujetas al impuesto sobre la renta, mientras
que el beneficio personal obtenido por el disfrute del tiempo libre no es
pechado Por ello, el impuesto sobre la renta tiende a hacer que los
individuos prefieran descansar" Vickrey deca que sus ideas respecto al
impuesto no fueron aplicadas porque hubieran dejado desempleada a la
burocracia de la oficina del impuesto.
<p>
Vickrey, en los aos 1962 y 63, trabaj en la planificacin urbana y
sistemas de transporte de la India, Argentina y Venezuela, haciendo
importantes contribuciones al mejor uso de recursos escasos, para lo cual es
necesario fijar un precio, ya que lo que nada cuesta se malgasta. Muchos
servicios como las carreteras, el transporte colectivo y la electricidad
requieren inmensas inversiones iniciales y cobrar lo mismo en las horas pico
crea congestin. Respecto a carreteras y puentes sugiri que el peaje fuese
ms caro durante las horas pico, de manera de desestimular el uso de esas
vas por personas que no tienen la necesidad de utilizarlas a esas horas. A
medida que aumenta la competencia en el servicio elctrico, los usuarios se
benefician gastando electricidad en horas en que es ms barata y las
empresas elctricas se benefician con un consumo ms estable, lo cual
aumenta la eficiencia de sus plantas.
<p>
Los amigos de Mirrlees cuentan que su nica pasin fuera de la economa y
la matemtica son las novelas de detectives. Y Vickrey, quien ni siquiera
saba exactamente cunto ganaba como profesor en Columbia, donde ense
durante medio siglo, dijo que no necesitaba el dinero pero s la tribuna que
el Premio Nobel le dara. Lamentablemente, sufri un ataque al corazn
mientras manejaba de Nueva York a Boston.

COMERCIO LIBRE O MANIPULADO

COMERCIO LIBRE O MANIPULADO
</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los beneficiarios del libre comercio son los consumidores,
quienes entonces gozan de libre acceso a los mejores y ms baratos productos
y servicios de todo el mundo. Los enemigos son los empresarios ineficientes
que no pueden competir, los sindicatos de industrias que por sus altos
costos hacen mal uso de escasos recursos y los polticos intervencionistas
que reciben contribuciones y apoyo electoral de quienes se oponen al libre
comercio.
<P>
 En los ltimos tiempos ha surgido un poderoso nuevo enemigo: grupos
ecolgicos activistas que ven la industrializacin como la peor amenaza a
sus utpicos deseos de que no hayan cambios en la naturaleza. Son grupos ms
preocupados por la supervivencia de insectos que por el bienestar y
crecimiento econmico de seres humanos que habitan sus adorados desiertos,
pantanos y junglas. Si en el siglo pasado estos grupos ambientalistas
hubieran tenido el poder poltico que hoy gozan en Estados Unidos y el apoyo
econmico de multimillonarias fundaciones privadas, este pas no se hubiera
industrializado y a lo mejor hubieran logrado devolverle Manhattan a los
indios. Ellos se han convertido en los peores y ms fuertes enemigos del
desarrollo latinoamericano, ahora que el nacionalismo socialista est en
evidente decadencia.
<P>
 Los aranceles y dems barreras al libre intercambio comercial perjudican al
consumidor nacional, aunque con ello los polticos y burcratas pretenden
perjudicar al empresario extranjero, en beneficio del empresario local.
Siendo esto as, lo lgico sera que los polticos eliminaran todas las
barreras al ingreso de productos y servicios extranjeros, pero ello va
contra su fibra dirigista, su desconfianza en el mercado que no es ms que
desconfianza en la habilidad del pueblo de tomar sus propias decisiones y,
sobre todo, no quieren perder la habilidad de castigar o complacer a
enemigos y amigos, que es lo que en realidad coloca poder en sus manos.
<P>
 El TLC/NAFTA ha sido un xito a medias. Sus diseadores quisieron estar
bien con Dios y con el diablo. Se abren las fronteras, pero si los precios
baratos de tomates y aguacates mexicanos afectan a agricultores
estadounidenses se aplican excepciones al tratado. Despus de todo, las amas
de casa aqu no van a chillar porque los tomates les cuesten diez centavos
ms, pero los agricultores s pusieron el grito en el cielo ante esa
"injusta" competencia. Lo mismo pasa con los transportistas mexicanos, a
quienes se les sigue prohibiendo entregar mercanca ms ac de la frontera,
en defensa de los intereses del sindicato de camioneros norteamericano. Eso,
claro est, no es libre comercio sino manipulacin poltica electorera.
<P>
 Un interesante informe secreto del Banco Mundial se filtr recientemente a
la prensa y deja muy mal parado al supuestamente exitoso Mercosur, donde lo
mismo que en el TLC/NAFTA lejos de reducirse unilateralmente los aranceles
se construy un inmenso mamotreto artificial, para proteger los intereses
empresariales ms poderosos en Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Paraguay. El
intercambio comercial aument de $4.200 millones en 1990 a $12.300 millones
en 1994 entre los cuatro pases, pero resulta que el grueso de ese aumento
ha sido en vehculos y maquinaria agrcola que antes se importaban, a
mejores precios, de Asia, Europa y Norteamrica, pero que ahora provienen de
ineficientes fabricantes argentinos y brasileos.
<P>
 El proteccionismo regional, que es el objetivo de los burcratas que se
pasan la vida en los mejores hoteles del mundo negociando acuerdos
bilaterales, representa apenas una leve mejora sobre el proteccionismo
nacional. Las cuotas de importacin y altos aranceles impuestos por Mercosur
lograron que el comercio intra-regional en vehculos aumentara de $207
millones en 1988 a $2.100 millones en 1994, pero con ello se termina
perjudicando su capacidad interna de competir con el  mundo exterior, ya que
los altos precios de vehculos y maquinarias aumentan los costos de
produccin de los miembros de Mercosur.
<P>
 Esto es lo que los economistas llaman "desviacin" del comercio. Los
paraguayos preferiran comprar carros buenos y baratos de Corea en lugar de
modelos viejos y caros de la Argentina. Pero la industria automotor en la
Argentina y Brasil es muy poderosa polticamente, determinando muchas de las
decisiones de Mercosur. Existe algo ms potencialmente peligroso que un
poltico intervencionista local: un burcrata intervencionista
supranacional. Por ello, los ambientalistas enfilan sus campaas hacia las
Naciones Unidas y dems agencias multilaterales.

NUNCA ANTES PAGAMOS MAS  EN IMPUESTOS

<P>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Segn los ltimos datos del Departamento de Comercio, el
inexorable crecimiento de los impuestos bajo Bill Clinton ha alcanzado un
nuevo pinculo. Para el segundo trimestre de 1996, los impuestos federales
como porcentaje del PIB han alcanzado su nivel histrico ms alto. El
gobierno federal le sac del bolsillo a los estadounidenses $1.572.500
millones, mientras que el PIB fue de $7.547.600 millones. Eso coloca los
impuestos en 20,8% del PIB.
<P>
 Para asegurarme de que los impuestos federales nunca haban sido tan altos,
calcul las contribuciones como porcentaje del PIB desde que existe esa
informacin. Las cifras del PIB anual van hasta 1929 y la informacin
trimestral desde 1946 hasta hoy. En todo ese tiempo, slo durante cuatro
aos los ingresos del gobierno federal alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB, y durante
tres de esos cuatro aos estbamos en guerra.
<P>
 Los impuestos federales alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB en 1943, en medio de la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. Llegaron a 20,6% en el primer trimestre de 1951,
durante la guerra de Corea y a 20,7% en el segundo trimestre de 1969, cuando
el recargo tributario de la Guerra de Vietnam estaba vigente. La ocasin
anterior en que los impuestos estuvieron casi tan altos como actualmente
bajo Clinton fue durante la primera mitad del ao 1981, alcanzando 20,7% del
PIB, debido a que la inflacin de dos dgitos sufrida durante la
administracin del presidente Carter elev a la gente a tramos superiores
del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
 As vemos que en ningn perodo anterior el gobierno federal agarr tanto
en impuestos como hoy lo hace Bill Clinton.
<P>
 Tanto el Departamento del Tesoro como la Oficina Presupuestaria del
Congreso creen que las cifras del segundo semestre son una aberracin
resultante posiblemente de pagos por ganancias de capital ms altas de lo
esperado, por la subida de la Bolsa de Valores. Sin embargo, el actual nivel
de contribuciones es consistente con la creciente tendencia experimentada
desde que Clinton lleg a la Casa Blanca y nos encasquet el aumento
impositivo ms grande de la historia de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Algunos grupos, como los izquierdistas del Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, argumentan que los impuestos que pagan los individuos no han
subido porque los ingresos adicionales provienen de impuestos corporativos y
de aumentos en las primas de Medicare (el seguro estatal para los ancianos).
Eso es una ingenuidad. Los impuestos corporativos los termina pagando la
gente a travs de salarios ms bajos, precios ms altos o dividendos
inferiores. Y mayores primas de Medicare reducen el ingreso disponible de la
misma forma como lo hacen impuestos ms altos. Por lo tanto, la proporcin
de los impuestos en el PIB sigue siendo la mejor medida de la carga fiscal. &copy;

LA LIBERTAD ECONOMICA ESTIMULA EL CRECIMIENTO

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Gary S. Becker*

<P>
CHICAGO (AIPE).- El colapso del comunismo y el xito  de los Tigres del
Asia estimularon un movimiento mundial hacia la privatizacin y la
desregulacin, ya que estos sucesos parecen indicar que la libertad
econmica es mucho ms efectiva que el control gubernamental en promover el
crecimiento. Los revisionistas han cuestionado tal conclusin, pero esta
recibi un resonante apoyo de parte de un importante estudio publicado por
tres economistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La obra Libertad Econmica en el Mundo utiliza 17 clasificaciones para
evaluar el grado de libertad en los ltimos 20 aos en ms de 100 pases.
Los autores estimaron la restriccin a transacciones internacionales en
bienes y flujos de capital, los controles de precios, la incidencia de
empresas estatales, la importancia de subsidios y transferencias
gubernamentales, los niveles de impuestos, la libertad de mantener fondos en
el extranjero y la inflacin. Estos factores fueron, a la vez, combinados en
ndices de libertad econmica que clasifican a las naciones y muestran los
cambios registrados desde 1975.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Estos ndices aportan la ms convincente evidencia de que las naciones no
crecen sin considerable libertad econmica. El producto bruto per cpita de
las 10 naciones con ms libertad econmica aument en promedio a razn de
2,3% por ao entre 1980 y 1984, comparado con un miserable crecimiento de
1,3% en los 27 pases menos libres. Mientras ms libertad, mayor tendencia a
un rpido crecimiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El ingreso real per cpita tiende tambin a ser mucho ms alto en los
pases con mayor libertad econmica. La media docena de pases ms libres
gozan de varias veces el ingreso per cpita de aquellos clasificados en el
medio y de ms de 20 veces que los menos libres. Se  muestra porqu muchos
de los pases africanos ocupan las ltimas 20 posiciones. Los apologistas
culpan a la dominacin colonial por el mal expediente de Africa, pero esa no
es la razn principal. Por el contrario, luego de la independencia muchas
naciones africanas imitaron el camino errado de los pases comunistas y
socialistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como muchas naciones mantuvieron una clasificacin de libertad estable en
los ltimos 20 aos, los resultados de aquellos que abrieron sus economas
son especialmente ilustrativos. La produccin de los 10 pases con el mayor
crecimiento de libertad econmica alcanz un crecimiento promedio de 2,7%
entre 1980 y 1994, mientras que las que ms restringieron la libertad
econmica sufrieron un crecimiento negativo. Chile, Portugal, Paquistn y
Mauritania, los cuatro pases en desarrollo con mayor aumento de libertad
econmica, crecieron mucho ms que los cuatro pases en desarrollo que
sufrieron aumentos en la intervencin gubernamental: Honduras, Irn,
Nicaragua y Venezuela.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Un creciente nmero de economistas niegan que el rpido crecimiento de las
economas asiticas comprueban la importancia de la libertad econmica,
indicando que sus gobiernos dirigen la actividad econmica. Indican que
Corea utiliz a los bancos estatales para aportar capital subsidiado a las
grandes empresas, que Taiwan controlaba las importaciones y los mercados
financieros, y que Singapur subsidiaba las inversiones extranjeras.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin embargo, estos nuevos ndices confirman que a pesar de tales
intervenciones, las economas en Asia han sido mucho ms libres que en otras
partes. Ocupan los primeros puestos en la clasificacin: Hong Kong es N 1,
Singapur N 3 y Japn N10. An Taiwan y Corea del Sur (nmeros 16 y 20)
gozan de libertad de comercio comparados con el resto del mundo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lamentablemente, los polticos pocas veces estn dispuestos a tomar
medidas impopulares en la reduccin de la intervencin gubernamental. A
pesar de las altas tasas de desempleo en Europa occidental, pases como
Francia y Alemania han hecho muy poco por desregular, aparentemente porque
temen la reaccin de los electores.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Este nuevo estudio aporta evidencias persuasivas de que la libertad
econmica es esencial para el crecimiento econmico. Ciertos pases sufren
innecesariamente porque no se permite el florecimiento de su energa e
imaginacin, en un ambiente de libertad.

<TITLE>Becker: Hay que Imponer Limites al Gasto Gubernamental -- 8/7/96
</TITLE>

<H2>HAY QUE IMPONER LIMITES AL GASTO GUBERNAMENTAL</H2>
Gary S. Becker*<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- No es ningn secreto que el sistema impositivo de Estados
Unidos es complejo y acosado por altas tasas. El nivel actual de los
impuestos reduce el crecimiento  y la eficiencia econmica al desviar
recursos productivos hacia esfuerzos por evitarlos y evadirlos. Por lo tanto
un sistema ms simple y ms parejo hara una gran diferencia. Pero para ser
efectiva, una reforma de los impuestos tendra que estar acompaada de
medidas que desalienten el crecimiento del gasto gubernamental.
<dd>	
Cuando se calculan los resultados de una simplificacin de los impuestos y
de reducir las tasas, a menudo se asume que el gasto gubernamental es
independiente del sistema impositivo. Recientemente, cuando el Wall Street
Journal pregunt a 12 economistas lo que pensaban de la tasa nica de
impuestos, todos la apoyaron, pero apenas unos pocos mencionamos el efecto
que tendra en los gastos gubernamentales.
<dd>	
El proceso poltico de las democracias virtualmente garantiza que el gasto
gubernamental dependa de la estructura impositiva. La mayora de los grupos
de presin tienen deseos insaciables de favores gubernamentales. El nico
freno a sus pretensiones es la resistencia de los contribuyentes. Si se
debilita esa resistencia a travs de una reforma impositiva que reduce el
costo de cumplimiento y los efectos perniciosos contra el ahorro y el
esfuerzo personal, el gasto gubernamental tender a aumentar. Mayores gastos
gubernamentales causarn ms dao que el beneficio obtenido por la reforma
impositiva.
<dd>	
El argumento que la resistencia contra impuestos ms altos es mayor cuando
la carga es ms pesada y ms transparente se comprueba por el hecho de que
los dueos de propiedades han sido los lderes de rebeliones antiimpuestos
en varios estados. Los impuestos a la propiedad  son onerosos porque son
altos y visibles. Robert Hall y Alvin Rabushka del Hoover Institution han
demostrado que las familias podran hacer su declaracin de impuestos en una
postal si el sistema actual fuese reemplazado por una tasa nica de 20%,
eximiendo del pago a los de bajos ingresos. Pero no toman en cuenta si ese
sistema ms simple y eficiente sera a la vez una tentacin para que el
Congreso y el presidente aumenten la tasa, a travs del tiempo, para
financiar viejos programas e iniciar otros nuevos.
<dd>	
Mi colega de la Universidad de Chicago Casey Mulligan y yo estamos
compilando pruebas sobre que la estructura impositiva est ntimamente
ligada al gasto gubernamental. Los impuestos al valor agregado comenzaron
con tasas mdicas en los aos 60. Hoy el IVA en Europa excede 20%. El
resultado es que el IVA ha permitido una rpida expansin del gasto
gubernamental.
<dd>	
Los impuestos del Seguro Social tienen una tasa nica aplicable desde el
primer dlar de ingresos. Comenzaron siendo muy bajos en los aos 30, pero
fueron aumentando hasta hoy, cuando los aportes del patrn y del empleado
significan 15% de los sueldos. Tales impuestos han sobrepasado 25% en muchos
pases europeos. Impuestos de tasa nica del Seguro Social han sido una
manera cmo los gobiernos han recabado inmensas cantidades de dinero. En
Estados Unidos proveen casi la misma cantidad que el impuesto sobre la renta
individual.
<dd>	
La estrecha relacin entre la estructura impositiva y los gastos
gubernamentales indica que la simplificacin tiene que ser combinada con un
mayor control del gasto pblico. Un presupuesto equilibrado puede ser un
paso en la direccin correcta, siempre y cuando el equilibrio se alcance
bajando gastos y no subiendo impuestos.
<dd>	
Ultimamente el gasto gubernamental en Estados Unidos ha sido frenado por la
recaudacin. Tanto el presidente Clinton como los miembros de ambos partidos
en el Congreso hubieran propuesto aumentos considerables a los gastos en
salud y en otros programas si el electorado no los hubiera obligado a
preocuparse del dficit. El gasto pblico de muchas naciones europeas fuera
mayor si no tuviesen que mantener su dficit presupuestario por debajo de 3%
del PIB para ser admitidos en la unin monetaria planeada para fin del siglo.
<dd>	
Pero hay que encontrar otras maneras de limitar gastos, especialmente si se
introduce la tasa nica. Se podra establecer un tope del gasto federal en
funcin del PIB, con la excepcin en tiempo de guerra u otra emergencia
nacional. O fijar como lmite el actual nivel en funcin del PIB, a menos
que una supermayora en el Congreso, de 60% o ms, vote por una proporcin
mayor.
<dd>	
A menos que se combine con mejores controles del gasto gubernamental, los
grandes beneficios de una tasa nica o de sistemas simplificados se
desperdiciaran en expansiones manirrotas, subsidiando industrias, la
agricultura, la beneficencia pblica y dems programas polticamente
atractivos. <p>

LAS ESCUELAS PUBLICAS REQUIEREN COMPETENCIA
</H2>
Gary S. Becker*
<br>
<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Durante la reciente campaa presidencial, Bill Clinton y
Bob Dole estuvieron de acuerdo en que el sistema de educacin pblica no
est cumpliendo con las necesidades educacionales de los nios pobres y de
clase media. Pero mientras que el Sr. Dole opina que la solucin est en
darles vales o becas a estudiantes para que vayan a escuelas privadas, el
presidente acepta la posicin de quienes se oponen a los vales, argumentando
que la competencia debilitara a la educacin pblica.
<P>
 Yo creo, por el contrario, que la competencia mejorara en vez de empeorar
la educacin pblica. Los opositores mantienen que a travs de los vales y
de becas los colegios privados captaran a la crema, a los mejores y ms
ambiciosos estudiantes. Como resultado, las escuelas pblicas se quedaran
con los indisciplinados, los desinteresados y los mentalmente atrasados. Sin
embargo, tal escenario asume que las escuelas pblicas no mejoraran con la
competencia.
<P>
 Hasta ahora, los colegios privados compiten con un brazo atado a la
espalda, por los subsidios de los contribuyentes que reciben las escuelas
pblicas. Un sistema de vales, bajo el cual los padres puedan seleccionar la
mejor escuela para sus hijos, aplicara una presin competitiva a las
escuelas pblicas, promoviendo el cambio.
<P>
 La causa del mal desempeo de la educacin pblica no tiene nada que ver
con insuficiencia de fondos, ya que los gastos por estudiante -en trminos
reales- se ha duplicado durante los ltimos 30 aos. A nivel nacional, el
costo por estudiante en escuelas pblicas es de $5.000 al ao y en muchas
ciudades alcanza $9.000 y hasta $11.000. El desalentador historial de las
escuelas pblicas generalmente es por su mala seleccin de cursos, falta de
seguridad personal y poca disciplina, lo cual desincentiva todo esfuerzo por
aprender. El sector privado atraera estudiantes ofreciendo mejores
programas de estudio, incluyendo insistencia en tareas, disciplina y
participacin de los padres, todo lo cual tiene gran atractivo para las
familias.
<P>
 Ya que la mayora de los maestros y administradores de las escuelas
pblicas estn dedicados a la enseanza, tratarn de reformar el sistema al
haber evidencia de que el sector privado est atrayendo a sus estudiantes
con los vales. Y si las escuelas pblicas son lentas en cambiar y continan
perdiendo alumnos habr gran presin poltica para que respondan a la
competencia: les reducirn los presupuestos y se despedirn los directores y
administradores que no logren competir.
<P>
 Federal Express y UPS mejoraron considerablemente el sistema de correos de
este pas al introducir un servicio rpido y confiable. Aunque el correo
perdi en la competencia de entregas de paquetes por ser el servicio privado
mucho mejor, a su vez mejor su servicio en respuesta a la demanda del pblico.
<P>
 La economista de Harvard Minster Hoxby encuentra que la competencia de
escuelas parroquiales mejora la educacin pblica del distrito. Todos los
estudiantes mejoran y no hay evidencia de que los colegios catlicos se
quedan con los mejores estudiantes.
<P>
 Muchos estudiantes extranjeros viajan desde  muy lejos para asistir a
universidades estadounidenses por su excelencia. La competencia que hay
entre miles de universidades mantiene despierto a profesores y administradores.
<P>
 El primer programa de becas universitarias para los veteranos de la II
Guerra le dio a muchos una oportunidad que de otra manera no hubieran
tenido. Ese programa mejor radicalmente la educacin superior, al aumentar
drsticamente la competencia por estudiantes. Los veteranos podan usar sus
becas para asistir a universidades privadas o pblicas que los aceptaran.
Esos fondos balancearon los subsidios recibidos por las universidades
estatales, forzndolas a mejorar para poder competir.
<P>
 Becas y vales para nios de los barrios pobres los ayudara en la misma
forma en que se beneficiaron los veteranos de la guerra. Entonces gozaran
de una mayor seleccin de opciones educativas y no estaran obligados a
recibir una educacin mediocre ofrecida por un monopolio estatal.
<P>
 Aun con un sistema de vales, muchos estudiantes -incluyendo lo muy buenos-
permaneceran en escuelas pblicas si estas mejoraran. Y sin duda mejorarn
si tienen que enfrentar la competencia del sector privado.

<title>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA
</h2>
Gary S. Becker*<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Desde 1989, Argentina rpidamente ha introducido
revolucionarias reformas para reducir el control y las regulaciones
gubernamentales. La privatizacin de su sistema de seguridad social ha sido
el paso ms importante en los ltimos dos aos. La experiencia argentina
muestra que, aun bajo circunstancias econmicas muy difciles, una nacin
puede convertir exitosamente su viejo sistema de reparto en un plan privado
de pensiones, con cuentas individuales.
<p>
El sistema de reparto cobra impuestos a los trabajadores para pagar las
pensiones de los retirados. El impuesto combinado a trabajadores y
empleadores en Argentina haba alcanzado 50% de la nmina, una aplastante
carga que desalentaba la creacin de puestos de trabajo, por lo que el
desempleo es de 17%.
<p>
Para evitar tanto los impuestos de Seguro Social como las exageradas
regulaciones, muchos trabajadores y empresas se pasaron a la economa
informal, estimndose que casi la mitad de los trabajadores argentinos
trabaja ilegalmente.
<p>
Cuando tantos trabajadores dejaron de aportar al Seguro Social, la
proporcin de aportantes a beneficiarios lleg a ser uno a uno, la ms alta
en el mundo. As se creo un crculo vicioso de altos impuestos a la nmina
empujando a trabajadores a la informalidad, lo cual presionaba para aumentar
an ms los impuestos.
<p>
El programa de privatizacin de pensiones iniciado en 1994 le da la opcin
a los trabajadores de quedarse en el viejo sistema estatal o transferir sus
contribuciones -fijadas en no menos de 11% de sus salarios- a uno de los
muchos fondos privados. Ms del 60% han optado por los fondos privados.
<p>
Los trabajadores, con cuentas individuales, acumulan un patrimonio para su
retiro, adems de que ganan intereses y dividendos sobre sus inversiones.
Los fondos hasta ahora han invertido principalmente en bonos
gubernamentales, pero se irn cambiando a acciones y bonos de empresas
privadas a medida que se recupere la economa argentina. Estas inversiones
ampliarn el mercado de capitales y mejores rendimientos aumentarn la tasa
de ahorro. Para impedir riesgos excesivos, el gobierno argentino supervisa
la colocacin de los fondos.
<p>
Los impuestos a la nmina que pagan trabajadores y empresas han podido
reducirse en 10 puntos. El mejor rendimiento de los fondos privados
significa que los trabajadores pueden aportar menos de lo que hacan al
viejo sistema y, de todos modos, recibir pensiones mayores. Y el aporte a la
seguridad social, en el caso de los trabajadores dej de ser un impuesto
para convertirse en una inversin, por lo que algunos trabajadores comienzan
a abandonar la economa informal.
<p>
Los economistas tienden a preocuparse por la transicin de un sistema de
reparto a la seguridad social privada. Pero Argentina est confirmando lo
que Chile demostr hace 15 aos: la transicin puede ser manejada fcilmente
porque el sistema privado es tanto ms eficiente.
<p>
An as los opositores a la privatizacin mantienen que no conviene en
Estados Unidos y Europa e insisten en asustar a los pensionados diciendo que
se les recortarn los beneficios. Todo lo contrario, la transicin debe ser
mucho ms fcil en Estados Unidos y Europa por gozar de mercados de
capitales mucho ms desarrollados que en la Argentina. Pero s se har ms
difcil en la medida de que se posponga porque el nmero de retirados est
creciendo ms rpidamente que el nmero de trabajadores.
<p>
Las naciones industrializadas deben sentirse agradecidas porque los
latinoamericanos estn mostrando el camino a seguirse y han sido pioneros en
la privatizacin del seguro social. Tanto los pensionados como los
trabajadores de las naciones ricas apoyaran la privatizacin si supieran lo
exitosa que ha sido en Argentina, un pas con mayores problemas econmicos
que las ms estancadas economas europeas.

<h2>
LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Alberto Benegas-Lynch (h)*
</a>

<P>
BUENOS AIRES (AIPE).- A principios de siglo el economista y socilogo
italiano Vilfredo Pareto deca que es difcil  implantar la libertad
econmica porque "el privilegio, incluso si debe costar 100 a la masa y no
producir ms que 50 a los privilegiados, perdindose el resto en falsos
costos, ser en general bien aceptado, puesto que la masa no comprende que
est siendo despojada, mientras que los privilegiados se dan perfecta cuenta
de las ventajas de las que gozan". 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una vez que se abren las compuertas de los subsidios se monta una mquina
que hace que se desate una competencia por los recursos escasos de lo que se
ofrece. De este modo los empresarios desvan su atencin del mercado y la
centran en quienes otorgan subsidios. Se desata as una lucha para ver quin
saca mejor partida a expensas de los dems, ya que el subsidio
necesariamente proviene de los bolsillos de otros que resultan expoliados.
Pero aqu no se trata simplemente de una suma cero, es decir, de una
transferencia coactiva de unos a otros. La competencia por obtener se desata
debido a que los recursos son limitados. Tambin son limitados los
privilegios, aunque no se trate de una transferencia directa de recursos,
puesto que si todos son privilegiados no habra privilegiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Esa competencia se lleva a cabo en base a ofertas de uno u otro tipo que
realizan los competidores a manos de los oferentes de privilegios. No
necesariamente debe recurrirse al cohecho directo o indirecto. Pero, en
cualquier caso, para proceder en este sentido se montan sistemas de cabildeo
para acercarse al poder, sea para convencer al burcrata de la "bondad" de
la propuesta o, debido a que no hay criterio racional para otorgar el
subsidio, para concretar una oferta monetaria a los efectos de que se
resuelva el privilegio en beneficio del postulante.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Supongamos que se trata de un subsidio de $10 millones; en este caso el
empresario estar dispuesto a invertir hasta $9 millones para lograr el
subsidio de referencia, lo cual, desde la perspectiva del resto de la
comunidad significar $19 millones derrochados. Los primeros $10 millones
significan un despilfarro debido a que todo subsidio implica que se sacan
recursos de las reas preferidas por la gente hacia las reas preferidas por
los gobernantes del momento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El sustento de lo que hemos bautizado como "la mquina de subsidiar"
radica en los incentivos que generan marcos institucionales debilitados y
corrompidos. En este sentido, David Friedman seala que en regmenes de este
tipo a muy pocos se les ocurre bregar por la abrogacin de cientos de leyes
para que todos se beneficien por igual de una sociedad abierta, puesto que
resulta mucho ms expedito y fructfero pelear por una nueva ley que otorga
un privilegio. Dice Friedman que el mecanismo consiste en buscar la manera
que 20 millones de  personas paguen un dlar cada una y el beneficiario se
alce con el botn de $20 millones. De este modo slo se oir la voz fuerte
de quien busca el privilegio y no se oir la de los perjudicados que
individualmente pierden poco. Incluso, si el beneficiario contrata
pseudointelectuales y pseudoperiodistas, para que justifiquen el desmn,
lograr que los expoliados lo apoyen. Solamente se oye la voz apagada entre
tanta bulla de intelectuales que quieren quebrar un sistema en el que los
incentivos operan para que se robe al prjimo en lugar de concentrarse en la
produccin sin privilegios. Estas voces resultan anmicas en medio de una
feroz puja para que los vndalos puedan enriquecerse a costa  de los dems.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es por todo esto que se tiene la falsa impresin de que la sociedad
consiste en una batalla campal resultante de una inexorable confrontacin de
intereses. De esta visin surgen las propuestas fascistas del corporativismo
conducentes a los tristemente clebres "pactos sociales" por los que los
capitostes de cada sector deben negociar en torno a una mesa para dar la
impresin de que intereses irreconciliables se negocian en aras de una nunca
alcanzada "paz social". Esta visin no permite ver la armona de intereses
inherentes al estado de derecho y la igualdad ante la ley. Quienes comparten
esta visin no parecen capaces de entender la coordinacin libre y
voluntaria que se lleva a cabo a travs del proceso de mercado.

MEXICO: LA REVOLUCION ECONOMICA POSIBLE
</H2>
Roberto Blum*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Proponer que la economa mexicana crezca a una
tasa de 5% anual, cubriendo la demanda de empleo de apenas un milln de
mexicanos al ao, es una muestra de, por lo menos, falta de imaginacin. Los
datos oficiales sealan que el empleo informal lleg al 21,7% de la
poblacin econmicamente activa, unos 8 millones de mexicanos.  Pero son
unos 20 millones los mexicanos que estn desempleados o que trabajan en la
economa informal. Estos requieren hoy un empleo productivo en la economa
formal. Un crecimiento a tasas tan mediocres como plantean los planes
oficiales es inaceptable.  
<P>
                Los "tigres y dragones," pases asiticos con crecimientos
sostenidos cercanos a 10% durante dcadas, lo lograron gracias a la
capacidad de sus gobiernos de movilizar a esas sociedades en torno a un
objetivo de crecimiento acelerado que produjo resultados tangibles en el
bienestar de las familias y de los individuos. Los gobiernos incentivaron la
disciplina y el esfuerzo, lo cual de inmediato se tradujo en beneficios
substanciales en el nivel de vida. 
<P>
                En Singapur hoy, 30 aos despus, casi todos los ciudadanos
son propietarios de su vivienda y han alcanzado niveles de bienestar
semejantes a los de Europa Occidental. China, con 1.200 millones de
habitantes, lleva ms de 15 aos creciendo a tasas verdaderamente
increbles. Hay regiones tan pobladas como Mxico que crecen al 25% anual.
Su secreto fue permitir que el esfuerzo realizado por cada campesino, por
cada obrero, por cada empresario lo beneficie directamente a l y a su
familia.  Las reformas del agro chino de 1978 se tradujeron en tangible
bienestar para las familias a partir de ese mismo ao.  Slo de esa manera,
los gobiernos pueden contar con la confianza de sus pueblos.
<P>
                En Mxico, el gobierno del presidente Zedillo est logrando
estabilizar la economa. Sin duda esto es muy importante, pero no es
suficiente. Si crecemos en los programas minimalistas del gobierno, los
niveles de bienestar perdidos en 1995 no se recuperarn as sino hasta el
ao 2007.  Otra generacin sacrificada.  Otra oportunidad que desperdicia el
gobierno en recuperar la confianza del pueblo. Y sin embargo, esto no
tendra que ser as. No estamos fatalmente condenados a ello. Mxico podra
iniciar un crecimiento acelerado a partir de 1997 y traducir ese crecimiento
en bienestar para todos los mexicanos. Todava tenemos algunas cartas de
triunfo en la mano, todava no se acaba el juego.
<P>
                El general Lzaro Crdenas -el "tata"- capitaliz a los
campesinos.  Les dio la posesin de un pedazo de tierra. As inici la
industrializacin del pas. La reforma agraria y la expropiacin del
petrleo de los aos 30 generaron entre los mexicanos la "ilusin del
cambio" que sostuvo polticamente al PRI durante 60 aos.  Salinas -el
"bueno"- disminuy la inflacin, dom la crisis y, sin duda, reparti
bienestar y esperanza entre los ms pobres con sus programas de
"solidaridad."  Entre todos los mexicanos gener una "ilusin del cambio" y
nos hizo ver la posibilidad de entrar al Primer Mundo. Con las reformas al
Artculo 27 de la Constitucin se dio fin a la reforma agraria, liquidando
el "ejido" o rgimen de propiedad comunitaria que negaba a los campesinos la
posibilidad de vender, arrendar, hipotecar o transmitir por herencia las
parcelas a sus hijos. Los programas Procampo y Procede iniciaron una
trascendente, aunque incompleta, "capitalizacin" del pas.
<P>
                Aunque tarde, el presidente Zedillo todava podra generar
la "ilusin del cambio" y recuperar la confianza de los mexicanos.  Todava
podra nacionalizar -hacer propiedad efectiva de los mexicanos- los bienes
que la burocracia gubernamental y sus aliados corporativistas nos ha
expropiado a todos.  El petrleo, por ejemplo, lo usufructa para su
provecho particular la burocracia y el sindicato de Pemex, sin que los
mexicanos reciban ningn beneficio. Las empresas estatales y sus activos
deben pasar a manos de sus verdaderos dueos, todos los mexicanos, mediante
la distribucin gratuita a cada ciudadano de los certificados que amparan su
propiedad.  De un plumazo, Zedillo -el "estadista"- podra capitalizar a
todas las familias mexicanas con unos cuarenta mil dlares (contando slo
las reservas petroleras), cumplir con su promesa de bienestar para todos y
generar la "ilusin de cambio" que nos permitira comenzar a crecer a tasas
que los asiticos nos han probado ser posibles de alcanzar.

<h2>
ECONOMA PARA GOBERNANTES
</h2>


Carlos Boloa B.*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes de turno, los ministros de
Hacienda y los polticos en general no conocen -u olvidan- los principios
econmicos ms elementales, y aplican frecuentemente polticas populistas
que pueden parecer positivas por sus efectos inmediatos, pero que al final
generan profundos daos y padecimientos.
<dd>        Por ello, debemos siempre recordar a nuestras clases polticas los
fundamentos esenciales de la ciencia econmica. As, puede contribuirse a
que no se repitan los graves errores del pasado. Ojal nuestros gobernantes
comprendan y recuerden estos principios bsicos:
<dd> El bolsillo es el rgano ms sensible. Por tanto, nadie mejor que uno
mismo para cuidar su propio bolsillo.  Ello quiere decir, adems, que la
naturaleza humana responde a incentivos: los individuos prefieren tener ms
a tener menos. La gente prefiere un dlar en su bolsillo que en el bolsillo
de otro o del gobierno, salvo que reciba a cambio de ese dlar un bien o un
servicio equivalente al mismo. No es de extraar que los individuos se
defiendan cuando les intentan reducir sus ingresos. Las polticas de
cualquier gobierno que vayan en contra de la naturaleza humana fracasarn
tarde o temprano.
<dd> Nadie cuida lo que no es suyo. Este es el fundamento de la institucin y
el fortalecimiento de la propiedad privada. Otros tipos o regmenes de
propiedad -como la estatal, social, cooperativa o cualquier otra que
inventen los "ingenieros sociales"- llevan a que nadie se responsabilice de
ella. Tarde o temprano, todos tratan de sacar ventaja de ella, a costa de la
participacin de los dems.
<dd> No se puede gastar ms de lo que se tiene. Esto puede hacerse por un
tiempo, por medio del endeudamiento, pero al final las deudas se pagan. El
individuo, la empresa o el gobierno que intente romper esta regla terminar
quebrado o en la insolvencia. Al principio, deja de pagar sus deudas, luego
pierde sus activos y, finalmente, cae en la quiebra -que es sinnimo de
dejar de operar, empobrecerse y quedar sumido en la miseria-.
<dd> Los pases tambin quiebran. Este es un principio derivado del anterior.
Cuando gastan ms de lo que tienen, los pases primero caen en cesacin de
pagos con el exterior y luego optan por el camino de malutilizar el
monopolio que poseen de imprimir dinero discrecionalmente. Ello genera
inflacin, que es la forma ms hipcrita de encubrir la quiebra.
<dd> No hay almuerzos gratis. Definitivamente, las facturas siempre se pagan.
Ello no quiere decir que siempre las paga quien debe, ya que algunas veces
los grupos de inters logran pasarle la factura al resto de la poblacin. Al
recibir una ventaja del gobierno -por ejemplo, jubilarse a temprana edad o
con sueldos del personal activo, o subsidiar la produccin nacional con los
impuestos a la importacin-, hacen que estas facturas se financien con el
dinero de los dems.
<dd> Lo que no nos cuesta lo hacemos fiesta. Esta es una verdad tan evidente
que la vemos a diario. La gente no valora las cosas cuando no le ha costado
dinero o esfuerzo.  Cuando te regalan las cosas, no las cuidas ni las
consideras. Esto es cierto en el caso de un bien material, pero tambin de
un servicio como la educacin o la salud. Es preferible, por ello, que quien
reciba algo, tenga que sacrificarse tambin con algo -puede no ser dinero
sino tiempo u otro recurso que pueda aportar-.
<dd> Los precios y el empleo no se determinan por decreto. Los precios, el
empleo productivo y el crecimiento econmico no se pueden establecer por
decreto. Los precios se determinan por la utilidad y por la escasez relativa
de los bienes o servicios disponibles en un momento dado. As, el tipo de
cambio refleja la escasez o abundancia relativa del dlar; la tasa de
inters, la del crdito; y el salario, la de la mano de obra. El gobierno,
cada vez que intenta fijar o controlar precios, slo entorpece el
funcionamiento del mercado, generando escasez o abundancia artificiales
-lase mercados negros o desempleo-.
<dd> Ms gasto pblico equivale a ms impuestos. La idea de mayor gasto pblico
es apetecible cuando se piensa en aumentos salariales, gasto social o de
inversin. Sin embargo, ese gasto viene aparejado con impuestos. A alguien
hay que quitarle para pagarlo. La primera tentacin es quitarle a los ricos,
pero generalmente eso no resulta suficiente. La segunda tentacin es
endeudarse, pero toda deuda se tiene que pagar. La tercera tentacin es
generar inflacin, que resulta el impuesto ms injusto, puesto que empobrece
al asalariado, al jubilado y a la mayora de la poblacin.
<dd> La pobreza se combate creando riqueza. Quitar riqueza a los que tienen
para drsela a los que no tienen es el camino seguro para empobrecer un
pas. Igualar es sinnimo de empobrecer. &copy

<title>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION
</h2>
Carlos Boloa B.*<br>
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Defino la corrupcin como "el uso del poder pblico para el
enriquecimiento privado". Ciertamente que los beneficios obtenidos
ilcitamente pueden tomar la forma de dividendos polticos, pero en este
artculo centrar la atencin en las causas y consecuencias de sus
beneficios econmicos.
<P>
La tentacin de incurrir en corrupcin depende de tres variables: 
<ol>
<li>El monto de las transacciones econmicas en las que participa el funcionario;
<li>Su duracin en el cargo; y, 
<li>La sofisticacin y complejidad de los servicios pblicos en cuya provisin participa. 
</ol>
As es que la corrupcin
suele ser mayor en las compras de armamentos y pertrechos militares; en
segundo lugar, en las compras de bienes de capital; luego, en los contratos
de ingeniera civil y compras de productos; y, finalmente, en los honorarios
por consultoras.
<p>
La corrupcin es tan antigua como la institucin del gobierno y hoy en da
es un fenmeno global, cuyo monto se estima alcanza la cifra de tres
millones de millones de dlares. Ningn pas se puede considerar libre del
mal, aunque no todos lo padecen en iguales dimensiones: la corrupcin es ms
comn en naciones con regmenes de gobierno arbitrarios, autoritarios y de
planificacin centralizada.
<p>
La necesidad de combatir la corrupcin es insoslayable, puesto tiene efectos
perversos para la vida en sociedad: socava las bases morales de la
democracia y de la economa de mercado al introducir distorsiones en la
informacin y el conocimiento que se deberan transmitir a travs de la
libre competencia de bienes y servicios polticos y econmicos. Por ello, la
corrupcin empobrece. Est demostrado que los pases que cultivan normas de
tica y moral elevados terminan creciendo ms. Un informe reciente estima en
$20 mil millones las cuentas en bancos suizos de lderes africanos.
Adems, la corrupcin genera ineficiencia en trminos de prdida o de mala
asignacin de los recursos productivos de una sociedad. Algunos estudios
sealan que los montos destinados a la corrupcin pueden representar desde
2% hasta ms de 50% de los costos totales de los bienes y servicios que
producen las naciones.
<p>
La corrupcin no slo afecta el crecimiento sino tambin a la equidad. A
travs de ella, los privilegiados se benefician de las operaciones y
transacciones corruptas a expensas de los pobres. De esta manera, se crea un
gobierno ineficaz cuyo nico objetivo es seguir corrompiendo para mantenerse
en el poder, dejando de lado las prcticas del "buen gobierno" y generando
inestabilidad poltica.
<p>
La falta de limitaciones al poder ejercido por diferentes dependencias
gubernamentales contribuye a una deficiente rendicin de cuentas y la
corrupcin infringe un grave y profundo dao moral a los ciudadanos al
premiar la conducta ilcita y castigar la honesta. Con ello genera un
ambiente de cinismo que, al difundirse, provoca la alienacin y la apata
ciudadanas.
<p>
La ecuacin de la corrupcin es la siguiente: Corrupcin = Monopolio +
Arbitrariedad - Transparencia.
<p>
La corrupcin surge de los monopolios artificiales, cuando existe
arbitrariedad o discrecionalidad sin lmites y cuando no existe
transparencia en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Por tanto, a mayor grado
de arbitrariedad y a menor grado de transparencia, mayor ser el nivel de
corrupcin.
<p>
La mala organizacin del Poder Pblico es una fuente segura de corrupcin.
Cuando los Poderes del Estado funcionan sin independencia entre s, abundan
las tentaciones de corrupcin. En ms de un pas latinoamericano, por
ejemplo, el Poder Legislativo le cobra favores polticos al Poder Judicial,
quien, entonces, no lo controla ni fiscaliza.
<p>
La pregunta es cmo reducir la corrupcin. Si se eliminan los monopolios se
reduce la arbitrariedad y se incrementa la transparencia, permitiendo as
combatir eficazmente la corrupcin. Entre las medidas concretas para lograrlo:
<ul>
<li>Aplicar cabalmente las instituciones de la economa de mercado y el Estado de Derecho, reduciendo el intervencionismo estatal en la economa.
<li>Establecer reglas generales, iguales para todos. Un arancel uniforme, sin exoneraciones, y un impuesto general a las ventas uniforme, sin excepciones, contribuiran a disminuirla.
<li>Fomentar la transparencia en las operaciones del gobierno. Convocar, por ejemplo,  licitaciones con supervisin internacional y publicacin de resultados.
<li>Simplificar al mximo los trmites administrativos.
<li>Concientizar a la ciudadana, puesto que la educacin es la clave de la transparencia.
<li>Encarcelar a algunos cuantos "peces gordos" de la corrupcin para que sirva de ejemplo y escarmiento.
<li>Crear una carrera administrativa seria, que acabe con la politiquera y el compadrazgo.
<li>Subir los costos y reducir los beneficios de la corrupcin, para demostrar que la honradez es rentable y que el ser honesto rinde sus beneficios.
<li>Aprobar normas de conducta que promuevan la rendicin de cuentas, abriendo los estados financieros de las empresas que hagan contribuciones a partidos polticos.
<li>Crear una Comisin Independiente contra la Corrupcin, bajo un esquema parecido al de Hong Kong, uno de los pocos pases que ha avanzado consistentemente en este terreno.
</ul>
Para sacar adelante estas medidas, se requerir de una frrea voluntad
poltica y de un poder moral vigoroso, que congregue a todos los sectores de
la opinin pblica.

<TITLE>Bongiovanni: Argentina: El Gran Desafio del Nuevo Ministro -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ARGENTINA: EL GRAN DESAFIO DEL NUEVO MINISTRO</H2>
Gerardo Bongiovanni*<p>
ROSARIO, ARGENTINA (<a href ="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Roque Fernndez, el nuevo ministro de Economa,
tiene credenciales tcnicas intachables. Graduado de la Universidad de
Chicago fue uno de los creadores del Centro de Estudios Macroeconmicos
Argentinos (CEMA). El peso argentino ha sobrellevado bien la transicin,
pero ahora Fernndez tendr que afrontar el dficit fiscal que lleva ya ocho
trimestres y que se ha agudizado en los ltimos tiempos. 
<dd>
Uno de los principales problemas de la economa argentina es el persistente
aumento del gasto pblico que en  1991 fue de $47.300 millones y que se ha
disparado 74% en cuatro aos, alcanzando $82.300 millones para 1995. Es
cierto que buena parte de este aumento se explica por el reconocimiento de
deudas pblicas -como en el caso de las jubilaciones y pensiones-, pero si
se piensa que en este mismo lapso se han privatizado decenas de empresas
pblicas -casi todas ellas deficitarias-, transferido cargas al sector
privado, como el mantenimiento de rutas ahora realizado a travs de peajes,
y se han eliminado organismos y dependencias, tal incremento resulta
verdaderamente asombroso.
<dd>
Algunos ejemplos ilustran la urgencia de reformas: la Presidencia de la
Nacin, con sus diez secretaras y doce organismos dependientes tiene 20.000
personas a su cargo y un presupuesto anual de ms de $1.200 millones, casi
el doble que lo que gasta el Poder Judicial Federal.
<dd>
El nmero de secretaras y subsecretraras ministeriales no ha hecho ms
que aumentar en los ltimos aos, no obstante un decreto del ao 1990 que
limitaba su nmero. A principios de 1991 haba 10 secretaras y 55
subsecretarias; hoy llegan a 58 y 111 respectivamente. Ahora se anuncia la
decisin de eliminar algunas, pero simultneamente se crearn tres o cuatro
nuevos ministerios que seguramente compensarn dichas reducciones.
<dd>
Captulo aparte es el llamado gasto social. En Argentina los gastos
sociales representan ms del 60% del total de gastos del gobierno. Estos
dineros no llegan a quienes lo necesitan sino que se quedan en el largo
camino de la burocracia. La paradoja es que se crean organismos para ayudar
a los pobres y luego 70% de sus presupuestos se gastan en sueldos de
burcratas. La nica pobreza que as se alivia es la de los empleados pblicos. 
<dd>
Pero indudablemente donde mayor es el caos y la irresponsabilidad oficial
es en las provincias y municipios. El empleo pblico provincial pas de
580.000 agentes en 1991 a ms de 1.100.000 en 1995, un incremento de 90%. En
tanto el gasto total de las provincias y municipios creci en 82% desde 1991
a 1995, de $20.700 millones a $37.700 millones.
En algunos estados hay un burcrata provincial por cada diez habitantes. Y
en general, el rubro salarios consume entre 70% y 80% de los presupuestos
provinciales, lo que claramente es indicativo del exceso de personal.
<dd>
El gobierno nacional trata de afrontar la situacin mediante "pactos
fiscales", a travs de los cuales compromete a los gobiernos provinciales
fondos y les exige como contrapartida que avancen en las privatizaciones de
bancos, energa, agua, etc. Hasta ahora los resultados han sido mediocres
debido a que, bajo el sistema fiscal argentino, el gobierno nacional recauda
la mayor parte de los impuestos y los "coparticipa" entre las provincias,
que a su vez hacen los mismo con los municipios.
<dd>
Este sistema fiscal de "arriba hacia abajo", en donde los estados y
ciudades generan una pequea parte de su presupuesto y reciben el resto,
desalienta toda intencin de ahorrar y reformar, ya que no hay premios ni
castigos, a la vez que se aleja a la administracin pblica del control
ciudadano. En Argentina, el grueso de las funciones gubernamentales son
asumidas por el gobierno federal.
<dd>
El ministro Fernndez parece estar consciente de la necesidad de
profundizar las reformas, reducir el peso de los impuestos e imponer
disciplina y eficiencia en el sector pblico. De no lograrlo, los mercados
internacionales nos impondrn la necesaria disciplina, un escenario que no
sera muy bonito.

<h2>
LOS FUNDAMENTOS DE LA SOCIEDAD LIBRE
</h2>
Nathaniel Branden*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Poco antes del derrumbe de la Unin Sovitica fui
invitado a participar en una conferencia en Acapulco, Mxico. Otro de los
expositores era Gennady Gerasimov, entonces portavoz de Gorbachev. Comenz
su discurso con un cuento en el que la Unin Sovitica haba invadido con
xito y conquistado al resto del mundo, con una excepcin, Nueva Zelanda. Se
haba tomado la decisin poltica de no invadir ese pas. Por qu? Para que
las autoridades soviticas pudieran conocer el precio de mercado de las
cosas. Toda la audiencia solt la carcajada y yo me qued petrificado.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mi mente retrocedi 40 aos atrs, cuando Ayn Rand me guiaba en la lectura
de Ludwig von Mises, el economista que por vez primera apunt la
imposibilidad del clculo econmico bajo el socialismo, explicando que esa
era la razn por la cual el sistema socialista terminara con un colapso
econmico. Tantos aos ms tarde, un representante de la Unin Sovitica
admita pblicamente, a manera de chiste, el argumento de Mises, tratndolo
como una evidente realidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ya muy pocos creen seriamente en el socialismo como un modelo viable de
organizacin social, pero est todava lejos la victoria del capitalismo.
Instituciones como Cato, adems de acadmicos e intelectuales alrededor del
mundo, aportan crecientes evidencias que ningn otro sistema puede competir
en cuanto a productividad y nivel de vida con el libre mercado, a la vez que
se demuestra que los gobiernos no slo fracasan en resolver los problemas
sociales sino que empeoran las mismas condiciones que tratan de mejorar.
Pero como decidido combatiente por la libertad me pregunto por qu la pelea
ha sido tan larga y por qu aparecen cien cabezas cuando le cortamos alguna
al monstruo estatista?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivimos en una cultura que ensea que la moralidad es el autosacrificio, la
compasin y el servicio a los dems. No asociamos la moralidad con ambicin,
realizacin, innovacin ni con las ganancias. Ahora llaman egosta a quien
hace lo que quiere en vez de hacer lo que nosotros queremos que l haga.
Pero si comparamos el bien que logran los que sienten compasin por los
dems con el logrado por aquellos que inventan y alcanzan xito creando
industrias y nuevos servicios, no hay duda de que los ltimos han hecho
mucho ms por la humanidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Uno de los grandes problemas que enfrenta la sociedad libre es la
disonancia entre los valores que realmente mejoran el bienestar de la gente
y las cosas que se ensean como nobles y morales. Mientras exista tal
incongruencia, la batalla por la libertad no podr ser permanentemente
ganada. En nuestro siglo hemos sufrido rebeliones virulentas contra los
valores de la razn, objetividad, la ciencia, la verdad y la lgica de parte
de filosofas como el postmodernismo, postestructuralismo,
deconstruccionismo y el determinismo histrico. No es accidente que nuestros
contrincantes son todos estatistas, pero si no se ejerce la razn lo que
queda es la coercin.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otro valor en decadencia es la autorresponsabilidad. Asumamos que el
crecimiento normal era la progresin de la dependencia de la niez a la
responsabilidad del adulto. Uno de los fundamentos principales del
liberalismo es la premisa de que tenemos que asumir la responsabilidad por
nuestras propias vidas. No hay otra forma en que funcione la sociedad
civilizada. Y durante demasiado tiempo ha existido una animadversin contra
el empresario. Sin embargo, si entendemos que el hombre de negocios es clave
para convertir los nuevos conocimientos en formas de mejorar el bienestar de
la gente, nos damos cuenta que ser antiempresarial es un error. Pero sin la
dimensin moral y espiritual lograremos apenas ganar el debate en el corto
plazo, mientras los estatistas asumen su manto de moralidad, por ms dao
que causen sus programas. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pienso que no hay batalla ms noble que la batalla por la libertad. Y no se
trata de una batalla a favor de la empresa privada ni del mercado. Se trata
de una batalla por la propiedad sobre nuestra vida misma.&copy; <p>

<H2>LAS CIUDADES NECESITAN MENOS, NO MAS, GOBIERNO</H2>
Harry Browne*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El gobierno no funciona. No mantiene la seguridad en
nuestras ciudades, no educa bien a nuestros hijos, la beneficencia
gubernamental es un incentivo a no hacer nada y no entrega el correo a
tiempo. Sin embargo, durante la campaa electoral oiremos mltiples
propuestas sobre nuevos programas para arreglar tales problemas, a pesar de
haber sido el gobierno quien los ha causado.
<dd>	
Examinemos los tres principales retos que enfrentan las ciudades hoy en
da: psimo sistema educativo, programas desbocados de beneficencia y
crmenes violentos. Aunque parecen ser problemas eternos son en realidad
relativamente nuevos. Estados Unidos era muy diferente en los aos 50.
<dd>	
La educacin no era perfecta, pero los graduados de bachillerato podan al
menos leer los exmenes de admisin a la universidad. La gran mayora de los
muchachos se graduaban de bachillerato con una educacin bsica en historia,
geografa, ciencias y matemticas.
<dd>
La beneficencia estatal era prcticamente desconocida. De ello se ocupaban
instituciones privadas y si acaso haba una pequea oficina en la parte
trasera de la alcalda. En tales sitios, cualquiera tena que explicar cmo
se haba metido en problemas y qu estaba dispuesto a hacer para salir de
ellos. Si su historia era creble y cumpla con sus promesas, se le ayudaba.
Debido a que no se necesitaba mucha beneficencia pblica, muchos
desconocamos su existencia.
<dd>
La estadstica de crmenes eran una fraccin de la actual. Cuando crec en
un suburbio de Los Angeles, sola caminar una milla para ir al cine, a las
10 de la noche los viernes, sin la menor preocupacin por mi seguridad. Hoy
no me siento seguro caminando las mismas calles a la 10 de la maana.
<dd>
Qu ha cambiado desde los aos 50? Mucho y el cambio ms grande de todos
ha sido la invasin del gobierno federal a nuestras ciudades y nuestras vidas.
<dd>
El patrn es el mismo en todas partes. El gobierno federal ofreci pequeos
subsidios para complementar los presupuestos municipales y estatales; luego
aument los subsidios. Una vez que el gobierno local se haba convertido en
adicto a tales subsidios tuvieron que obedecer para seguir recibiendo
dinero. Como resultado de todo esto, gran parte de las decisiones hoy se
toman en Washington. Los presupuestos locales son exageradamente altos, en
muchos casos porque el gobierno local tiene que gastar grandes sumas de su
propio dinero para calificar en la obtencin de fondos federales.
<dd>
El Congreso republicano ha respondido prohibiendo mandatos federales que no
asuman sus costos y al ofrecer traspasar a los estados fondos libres de
ataduras. Pero ninguna de las dos respuestas es suficiente. Tenemos que
quitarnos de encima todos los mandatos federales, tanto los que paga el
gobierno central como los que no. Los polticos de Washington no saben lo
que conviene a su ciudad. Y cul es la ventaja de enviar dinero a
Washington para que luego sea devuelto? Tenemos que quitarnos al gobierno
federal de encima en educacin, beneficencia y control criminal.
<dd>
Y aunque estos son los problemas ms obvios no son los nicos. Washington
hace tambin dao interfiriendo en la construccin de carreteras, en salud,
en el ambiente, etc.
<dd>
Segn el censo, el gobierno federal, estatal y local toma el 47% del
ingreso nacional en impuestos. Al tratar de resolverlo todo a travs del
gobierno, hemos agravado los problemas de las ciudades e imposibilitado a
los contribuyentes enfrentar sus propios problemas.
<dd>
Debemos empezar el camino de la recuperacin limitando al gobierno federal
a slo aquellas funciones determinadas por la Constitucin. Eso reducira el
tamao del gobierno lo suficiente como para revocar el impuesto sobre la
renta, permitiendo a las ciudades resolver sus problemas.
<dd>
Para ver el alcance de esta revolucin fjese cunto le deducen de su
sueldo en impuesto sobre la renta y Seguro Social. Entonces pregntese lo
que usted podra hacer con ese dinero. Pondra a sus nios en colegios
privados que ofrecen mejor educacin y valores? Ahorrara para abrirse por
su cuenta como siempre lo ha deseado? Se mudara a una casa mejor?
Ayudara ms a su obra de caridad preferida?
<dd>	
Usted trabaja por ese dinero y debiera poder decidir su uso. Eso no es
funcin de los polticos, quitndoselo para luego devolverle lo que les
parece, como si usted fuera un nio recibiendo una mesada.
<dd>	
Hay algn beneficio que el gobierno le da que usted no pueda reemplazar
con creces con el dinero que ahorrara en impuestos?
<dd>	
Es hora de volver a tomar posesin de nuestras ciudades, de nuestro dinero
y de nuestras vidas.

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AIPE).- A medida que Amrica Latina adelanta su proceso de
reforma econmica se hace ms evidente la necesidad de contar con un sistema
judicial eficaz. La democratizacin, la concentracin de la poblacin en
reas urbanas y la apertura econmica han aumentado la complejidad de la
interaccin social y, en consecuencia, la demanda por servicios judiciales
en la resolucin de conflictos. Adems, la economa de mercado exige
definiciones claras sobre derechos y obligaciones.
<p>
El sistema judicial, que incluye todos los mecanismos necesarios para
interpretar las leyes y regulaciones, es un elemento clave en el desarrollo
econmico. Sin embargo, los tribunales latinoamericanos sufren de crecientes
demoras y de corrupcin, lo cual genera desconfianza en el sistema. En casi
todos los pases latinoamericanos se observa una falta de consistencia en la
aplicacin de la jurisprudencia, lo cual unido a retrasos en resolver casos
aumenta el costo de acceso a la justicia y tambin de realizar negocios e
inversiones.
<p>
A medida que aumenta el costo de la justicia, la gente reacciona acudiendo
menos a los tribunales. Un reciente estudio muestra que la mayora de los
usuarios no se inclinan a acudir a un tribunal para resolver disputas porque
perciben el sistema como lento, incierto, costoso y de "pobre calidad". La
desconfianza en el sistema judicial es considerablemente mayor entre
empresarios pequeos y las familias de bajos ingresos.
<p>
A menudo se argumenta que se sufre de presupuestos inadecuados, pero pases
como Dinamarca, Japn y Alemania, donde el pblico tiene gran confianza en
el sistema judicial, el gobierno asigna porciones menores de su presupuesto
que Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Mxico, las naciones cuyos tribunales
gozan de la menor confianza por parte del pblico. No se ha comprobado
relacin alguna entre la eficiencia judicial y el tamao del presupuesto
asignado a los tribunales. Encuestas realizadas en Argentina, Venezuela,
Ecuador y Per muestran que entre 55% y 75% del pblico tiene una muy baja
opinin del sector judicial. La percepcin general es que el entrenamiento
de los jueces es pobre y que no se garantiza la igualdad ante la ley.
<p>
Una pregunta clave es por qu los jueces a menudo se oponen a las reformas.
La respuesta se basa en que funcionarios gubernamentales se aprovechan de
los tribunales para obtener rentas ilcitas, lo cual en gran parte es
posible debido a la amplia discrecionalidad monoplica de que gozan los
jueces.  Por ejemplo, la costumbre de que los jueces reciben por separado a
las partes crea fuertes incentivos a la corrupcin. Como tampoco hay normas
establecidas sobre el lapso de tiempo antes de iniciar el juicio o sobre su
duracin, esto se presta a que funcionarios del tribunal cobren por agilizar
los trmites.
<p>
Otro problema es la frecuente concentracin de poder en las manos del juez,
quien asume mltiples roles en cuanto a la programacin estratgica, el
manejo de personal, la administracin de recursos, control presupuestario y
la adjudicacin de casos, todo lo cual distrae su atencin de la resolucin
de casos pendientes y abre mltiples posibilidades de corrupcin, debido a
la ausencia de mecanismos internos y externos de control.
<p>
La inercia frente a la necesidad de las reformas judiciales en parte se
explica porque los beneficios, tales como mayor inversin y crecimiento
econmico  son generales y a largo plazo, mientras que el costo es
individual e inmediato:  la desaparicin de los ingresos por corrupcin. Por
lo tanto, parte de las reformas tendran que incluir mayores beneficios a
corto plazo dirigidos a los funcionarios del sistema judicial, a travs de
generosas pensiones, promociones para los jueces y empleados de los
tribunales, nuevas instalaciones y ms amplios presupuestos.
<p>
La corrupcin implica un rompimiento del cdigo de tica colectivo que
beneficia al individuo que paga bajo la mesa para conseguir lo que desea del
tribunal, pero la sociedad se perjudica por una cada de la productividad a
travs del tiempo causada por la generalizada percepcin de que la
asignacin de recursos se hace de manera poco equitativa, al ser determinada
por prcticas corruptas. El estudio de la historia econmica prueba que la
corrupcin sistmica observada en la administracin de justicia en Amrica
Latina seguir contribuyendo al retraso econmico de la regin.

<h2>
BRASIL PICA EN PUNTA
</h2>
Alejandro Antonio Chafuen*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Hay tres elementos claves que los ejecutivos de
empresas multinacionales toman en cuenta al decidir sobre dnde invertir:
estabilidad poltica, estabilidad monetaria y respeto a los derechos de
propiedad. Justo cuando los titulares de la prensa mundial reportan el
impasse entre Estados Unidos y China por la piratera no controlada de
pelculas, msica y programas de computacin, el presidente del Brasil,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, procedi a firmar una ley de patentes de
productos farmacuticos que puede servir de modelo al mundo y que representa
un importante paso de Brasil hacia el liderazgo econmico en nuestro hemisferio.
Brasil enfrenta tremendos retos econmicos. Debe mantener una moneda
estable, reforzar su sector financiero, liberalizar sus leyes laborales y
privatizar un gran nmero de empresas estatales. Luego de varias dcadas de
equivocadas inversiones, la reformas resultan dolorosas. Para hacer menos
traumtica esa transformacin, Brasil requiere considerables influjos de
inversin extranjera. La nueva ley de patentes har mucho ms fcil atraer
el capital requerido y debido a la debilidad de la actual legislacin
argentina en la materia, aquellas inversiones que hubieran hecho en dicho
pas las industrias de alta tecnologa ahora irn al Brasil.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     	La nueva ley brasilea es un hito en la dinmica de la
infraestructura econmica mundial para la innovacin mdica. Favorece la
medicina, la ciencia, la investigacin, el crecimiento econmico y la
atencin mdica para la gente del Brasil y el resto de Amrica del Sur. Se
trata de un nuevo ingrediente en la estrategia de liberalizacin poltica y
econmica, impulsando al Brasil hacia un verdadero liderazgo entre las
economas en desarrollo y los mercados emergentes, fijando rumbo para
alcanzar un posicin clave entre las democracias industriales  del siglo XXI.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     	Desde tiempos de Adam Smith, prominentes economistas han mantenido
que la riqueza de las naciones depende de un vasto mercado, sin trabas a la
divisin del trabajo y respeto por la propiedad privada. La inmensa riqueza
natural y humana del Brasil, junto a su nueva posicin de liderazgo en el
dinmico mercado latinoamericano, prometen ofrecer oportunidades econmicas
de excepcin. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Analistas con los ms diversos enfoques, incluyendo tanto al Vaticano como
al Valle Silicn, coinciden en que los activos ms importantes en la era de
la informacin son intangibles. La fortaleza econmica hoy depende en gran
parte de ideas, informacin y conocimientos, lo cual convierte la propiedad
intelectual en ingrediente esencial. Una buena ley de patentes, como la
recin promulgada en Brasil, es de especial importancia para la innovacin
farmacutica, al reducir el inmenso riesgo que conlleva el descubrimiento y
desarrollo de nuevas medicinas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El costo promedio de una nueva droga es de $500 millones y el proceso toma
12 aos. Lo sorprendente es que el grueso de los descubrimientos mdicos no
se logran en dependencias gubernamentales ni universidades, sino en las
empresas privadas que realizan las investigaciones. En este sentido, las
estadsticas en Estados Unidos son determinantes: 99% de las medicinas ms
frecuentemente prescritas fueron desarrolladas por la industria privada y el
equivalente al 92% de las nuevas sustancias qumicas aprobadas entre 1981 y
1990 provinieron de laboratorios privados. Sin embargo, las universidades,
los hospitales, la industria y los gobiernos forman parte del esfuerzo
conjunto de investigacin que el sistema de patentes hace posible. 
Para Brasil, el beneficio de la nueva ley ser la transferencia de
conocimientos y   tecnologas, enriqueciendo sus procesos de investigacin y
desarrollo. La empresa innovadora conoce ms que cualquier otra las
caractersiticas sobre las nuevas medicinas, por lo que juega un papel
crucial para la comercializacin y transferencia de informacin al cuerpo
mdico. Sin patentes, cualquiera puede vender las medicinas, pero se pierde
el importante aporte al tratamiento de pacientes hecho por la firma que las
desarroll, imposibilitando a su vez la creacin de centros locales de
investigacin y desarrollo. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ultimamente, un impresionante grupo de naciones -Canad, la Repblica Checa,
Corea del Sur, Mxico y Taiwan, entre otras- ha mejorado substancialmente
sus leyes de patentes y ahora Brasil se coloca a la cabeza de ese grupo. Las
naciones en este sentido rezagadas, como Argentina y la India, pagarn un
alto precio, en el retraso de sus centros de investigacin y en la salud de
la ciudadana.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La idea del hemisferio americano unido por la libertad de comercio, la
tradicin constitucional republicana y los derechos humanos sigue siendo un
sueo que slo se har realidad con la convergencia de estructuras legales
basadas en los principios que han permitido a las civilizaciones madurar y
desarrollarse. Los derechos de propiedad intelectual forman parte integral
de tales principios y la iniciativa brasilea favorece justamente esa
dinmica. <&copy;p>

<H2>VENEZUELA: SUBDESARROLLO LABORAL</H2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>



CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- Los sueldos que recibe la mayora de los venezolanos no
alcanzan para vivir. Con el salario mnimo diario no se compran ni siquiera
dos Big Mac. Los polticos, quienes insisten en ignorar las races del
problema, creen que elevando el salario mnimo resolvern el problema.
Cada ao se aumenta el salario mnimo con la ilusin de proteger al
trabajador de los funestos efectos de la inflacin creada por las
autoridades monetarias. Pero atacar los sntomas, mientras se le da la
espalda a las verdaderas causas, conduce a mayor desempleo y  desconfianza.
Los obstculos que impiden mejorar el nivel de vida del venezolano son
principalmente nuestra psima a legislacin laboral, el  inmenso peso del
aparato gubernamental y la constante emisin de dinero inorgnico para tapar
huecos presupuestarios. Tan espectacular es la catstrofe econmica que
sufrimos que se comienza a generar presin popular por adelgazar al Estado,
por exigir eficacia a los polticos y burcratas, por cambiar leyes que
impiden la inversin, por reformar los corrompidos sistemas pblicos de
seguridad social y de administracin de justicia. Lamentablemente, la
probabilidad que se instrumenten reformas adecuadas en el exageradamente
politizado mbito laboral es nfima.<p>
Una de las aberraciones de la ley laboral venezolana concierne el pago de la
antigedad. Por cada ao de empleo, el trabajador se hace acreedor al
equivalente de un mes de salario, monto que se hace efectivo cuando se
retira de la empresa, pero que constantemente se recalcula en base al ltimo
sueldo. As, todo aumento de salario tiene un efecto retroactivo. En tiempos
de inflacin esta deuda de las empresas se dispara de tal manera que obliga
a los patronos a deshacerse de sus empleados ms veteranos, con la inmensa
prdida de productividad que ello acarrea para la economa.
Al gobierno, por el contrario, no le importa acumular pasivos que
administraciones futuras tendrn que pagar y por ello, aunque emplea al 20%
de los venezolanos, el sector pblico acumula 66% del pasivo por
prestaciones sociales.<p>
La situacin se agrava si el retiro ocurre por decisin del patrono y no del
trabajador, no importan las razones; entonces la antigedad se paga doble.
Por ello, un trabajador que tenga 15 aos en la empresa y gane $5.000 al
ao, despedirlo cuesta $14.000.<p>
La inflexibilidad que estas leyes populistas le han impuesto a la economa
venezolana es motivo importante del empobrecimiento de la nacin y del
atraso de nuestra industria, imposibilitada por las autoridades a competir
con el resto del mundo. Pero, los ms afectados son los miembros de la misma
clase trabajadora ante la desaparicin de ofertas de empleo y por la
imposibilidad de conseguir aumentos de sueldos a medida que sube el costo de
la vida. Eso tambin explica porque ms de la mitad de los venezolanos
laboran en la economa informal, sin ningn tipo de proteccin social.
A pesar de esta tragedia nacional, los sindicatos, fuerza dominante en
varios de los principales partidos polticos aunque representan slo a una
muy pequea parte de los trabajadores, se niegan a aceptar reformas que
impliquen la prdida de sus "conquistas", insistiendo que los "derechos
adquiridos" de los trabajadores no son negociables. <p>
 	El presidente Caldera y su actual ministro del Trabajo parecen ahora
comprender el problema, pero ellos fueron los autores de la ley promulgada
en 1990, cuando en la oposicin utilizaban todas las tradicionales armas de
la demagogia.<p>
Ahora se habla de que la ley se debera aplicar slo a quienes devengan
hasta 10 salarios mnimos. La verdad es que la situacin difcilmente podra
ser peor y da a da se hace ms evidente el atraso institucional de
Venezuela vis-a-vis el resto del continente. <p>

<h2>
CUBA: LAS MENTIRAS OFICIALES
</h2>     
Vladimir Chelminski*<BR>
<P>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Toda Amrica Latina, excepto Cuba, pudo ver la entrevista
que le hizo Dan Rather a Fidel Castro y el posterior debate sobre la misma
entre Ricardo Alarcn, presidente de la Asamblea del Poder Popular de Cuba y
Jorge Mas Canosa, presidente de la Fundacin Nacional Cubano-Americana. La
aseveracin del Sr. Alarcn de que el deseo de emigrar a Estados Unidos no
es un fenmeno cubano sino ms bien una realidad latinoamericana tiene algo
de verdad. La diferencia es que en Cuba la gente est desesperada por comer
completo, sufre una total falta de libertad y la imposibilidad de soar en
una vida mejor dentro de su patria.
<P>
Puede ser que muchos de los pobres de Amrica Latina
quisieran emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero no estaran dispuestos a correr los
mismos riesgos. Y mienten las autoridades cubanas cuando aseguran que la
falta de todo en la isla se debe al embargo estadounidense, pues estamos en
la era de las comunicaciones, por lo que es posible importar mercancas de
diferentes orgenes siempre y cuando se pague con moneda dura. La verdadera
causa de la escasez en Cuba es que el socialismo destruy todo incentivo por
producir e intercambiar.
<P>
Lamentablemente, por toda Amrica Latina campea la miseria, pero tambin hay
que aclarar que en gran parte ella se debe a la irresponsabilidad individual
que nos ha caracterizado en materia de paternidad, como tambin a que en
muchos aspectos vitales hemos seguido modelos socialistas no muy diferentes
al cubano.
<P> 
Esferas tan importantes como la educacin, la salud, el
transporte, la produccin y distribucin de energa han sido socializadas
por nuestros gobiernos, los cuales tambin han tendido a monopolizar la
explotacin de nuestras riquezas naturales y de aquellos renglones en los
que gozamos de ventajas comparativas, eliminando as la competencia, sin la
cual no existe eficiencia alguna en la produccin ni en la distribucin.
<P>
La mayora de nuestras constituciones fueron redactadas o
enmendadas por simpatizantes de las ideas de Marx y Lenin, las mismas que
inspiraron la revolucin castrista. En el resto de Amrica Latina, el estado
no ha sido tan horriblemente cruel y sanguinario, pero a travs de una
constante intervencin en la vida y el trabajo de los ciudadanos tambin ha
logrado retrasar nuestro desarrollo y nuestra habilidad de competir en el
mundo moderno.
<P>
Los cubanos prefieren emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero en su
defecto lo haran gustosamente a  cualquier otro pas del hemisferio
occidental, mientras que nadie en su sano juicio intentara jams emigrar a
Cuba, a menos de que sea perseguido por la justicia.
<P>
El respeto a los derechos de propiedad, que son la base de
la prosperidad y seguridad en Estados Unidos, fue el principal objetivo
atacado frontalmente por la Revolucin Cubana. La propiedad no es muy
respetada tampoco por la mayora de los polticos latinoamericanos, quienes
se aprestan a rechazar la Ley Helms-Burton, la cual pretende impedir que se
trafique con propiedades de ciudadanos estadounidenses que la revolucin
confisc, sin compensacin alguna.
<P>
Sobre expropiaciones arbitrarias en Amrica Latina tenemos
una larga y triste experiencia, aunque es plida frente a la de los cubano.
Como es tan tenue el respeto a la propiedad privada  en Amrica Latina,
nuestros lderes no estn en capacidad de entender bien una ley que se
refiere a  propiedades robadas por el estado. El da que el pueblo de Cuba y
del resto de Amrica Latina entienda cabalmente la importancia del concepto
de la propiedad como institucin social fundamental que alienta la
administracin cuidadosa de recursos escasos, comenzar entonces una
revolucin pacfica conducente a la prosperidad, el orden y el amor por la
patria. 
<P>      
Pero est claro que el problema cubano es mucho ms
dramtico que el del resto de Amrica Latina, a la vez que es inslito que
por todo el continente se desplacen sacerdotes propagando laTeologa de la
Liberacin, la idea de que una revolucin como la cubana  puede ser el
remedio para nuestros males. Es tambin absurdo que nuestros gobernantes
continen apoyando la dictadura castrista frente a un pas libre como
Estados Unidos. &copy;

<title>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES
</h2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El comercio irregular de mercancas importadas, en
particular de los equipos de oficina, mdicos, de sonido y vdeo, las
neveras, cocinas, lavadoras, etc. alcanza  hoy niveles sin precedentes en
Venezuela. Tan grave es el problema que conocidas empresas multinacionales
como Sony, Panasonic, Hitachi, Compact, Hewlett Packard, Phillips, Epson,
que ofrecen sus productos cumpliendo con todas las leyes, se estn
preparando para marcharse y abandonar sus operaciones en el pas.
<p>
Por comercio irregular me refiero a mercancas de contrabando que no pagan
aranceles que promedian 20%, bienes robados o utilizados como pretexto para
lavar dinero proveniente del trfico internacional de estupefacientes,
tambin artculos de segunda mano que son vendidos como nuevos o
comercializados evadiendo el IVA de 16,5%, impuesto que en ciertos renglones
llega hasta 36,5%.  Este mercado negro que se ha disparado en Venezuela este
ao atenta contra la viabilidad del comercio establecido y muchos de los
compradores no tienen idea de la procedencia de lo que adquieren ni
sospechan la posibilidad de futuros problemas, en cuanto a calidad y
garantas de servicio y repuestos.
<p>
Con la progresiva desaparicin de los representantes y distribuidores
legtimos de esas marcas tiende tambin a desaparecer el personal entrenado
para cumplir con la garanta y reparacin de bienes costosos, como
computadoras y televisores, a la vez que la ciudadana se va acostumbrando
tanto a la corrupcin oficial como al incumplimiento de la ley, aceptando la
evidente ausencia de seguridad jurdica.
<p>
Segn estadsticas presentadas por el Consejo Nacional del Comercio y los
Servicios, las ventas al detal durante el primer semestre de este ao
cayeron en Venezuela 50%, comparadas con el mismo semestre del ao pasado;
la venta de vehculos cay en 65% y la venta de alimentos se redujo en 35%.
No se conoce la proporcin de esas ventas que ahora se realizan en la
economa informal.
<p>
La Cmara de Comercio de Caracas apoya la reforma de las aduanas anunciada
por las autoridades porque suele tomar 10 a 15 das retirar mercancas de
los puertos venezolanos. La reforma apunta a la simplificacin y aceleracin
de los trmites. Se oponen los que hoy viven  del robo de mercancas
almacenadas en los puertos y de la extorsin a los importadores para
agilizar complicados y anticuados trmites oficiales.
<p>
Cuando Transparency International, prestigiosa institucin alemana,
cataloga a Venezuela reiteradamente como uno de los pases ms corruptos de
Amrica Latina y del mundo, lo hace principalmente por la mala fama de
nuestro sistema judicial y de nuestras aduanas. Cuatro veces han fracasado
los intentos de reformar el sistema aduanal venezolano en los ltimos cuatro
aos, lo cual es indicativo del poder poltico y econmico de sus
opositores. La reforma anunciada comenzar con un plan piloto en la aduana
martima de La Guaira y se espera sea pronto extendida al resto de los
puertos y aeropuertos venezolanos.
<p>
Esta reforma es un primer paso para eliminar el contrabando que debe ser
seguido de la rebaja y unificacin de impuestos, a todas luces excesivos. El
bienestar nacional reclama la unificacin de aranceles en alrededor de 7% y
del IVA en 10%. El Fisco recaudar mucho ms cobrando 7% sobre todas las
importaciones que cobrando 20% de las que hoy cumplen con la ley. Y quienes
hoy se arriesgan pagando sobornos para evitar el pago tanto del IVA como de
los aranceles difcilmente continuaran hacindolo con impuestos razonables.
<p>
Otra fuente de fraude y corrupcin es el puerto libre de la isla de
Margarita, donde se  conceden privilegios a determinados ciudadanos que le
son negados a todos los dems. No slo los residentes de Margarita necesitan
incentivos. Incentivos tambin requieren los que han invertido a travs de
los aos en establecer sus marcas y el buen nombre de sus establecimientos
comerciales, ofreciendo el buen servicio de su personal entrenado y precios
competitivos para su clientela. Son estos los comerciantes que por la
ignorancia econmica y poca visin de legisladores y funcionarios estn
desapareciendo.

<h2>
REFORMA ELECTORAL
</h2>

Edward H. Crane*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Uno de los temas ms importantes -y peor entendidos- que
enfrenta Estados Unidos es la reforma electoral. La reforma de las leyes que
rigen el financiamiento de las campaas choca de frente con la ms popular
de las reformas propuestas, la que busca asignar un lmite a las veces que
un congresista puede ser reelegido.
<dd>	El intento de reformar el financiamiento de las campaas, de la manera como
ha sido recientemente presentado en el Congreso, es ms bien una solucin en
bsqueda de un problema. Las crticas de que estamos gastando cantidades
"obscenas" en las elecciones no tienen base en la realidad. En Estados
Unidos gastamos menos de $10 por elector en cada ciclo de dos aos para cada
cargo en el pas, desde atrapador de perros callejeros a presidente de la
nacin.
<dd>	Dado el inmenso impacto que los funcionarios electos tienen en nuestras
vidas y en nuestros bolsillos, se puede ms bien argumentar que no estamos
gastando lo suficiente. Eso es particularmente cierto si reconocemos que el
dinero es lo que nos permite ser informados durante las campaas. Herbert
Alexander, director de Citizens Research Foundation lo explica de la
siguiente manera: "Los gastos en las campaas deben ser considerados como lo
que pagamos para ser educados sobre los temas polticos. Las campaas ms
costosas resultan ser aquellas donde los electores hacen una mala seleccin
por falta de informacin".
<dd>	Es obvio que los lmites que se tratan de imponer a los gastos en las
campaas electorales de los congresistas beneficia a los miembros actuales y
perjudica a desconocidos que aspiran reemplazarlos.
Por el contrario, aquellos que intentan limitar las reelecciones de los
congresistas buscan abrir el proceso poltico. Ellos quieren que sus
conciudadanos que viven y trabajan en el mundo real, lejos de Washington,
vayan a la capital como sus representantes, por tiempo limitado, en lugar de
los polticos profesionales que favorecen las propuestas de limitar el
financiamiento de las campaas.
<dd>La limitacin de las reelecciones combinado a la total transparencia e
informacin sobre las contribuciones recibidas por los candidatos
conformaran una verdadera reforma. Ello permitira que gente competente,
con las ms diferentes posiciones, pudiesen recolectar suficientes fondos
para participar como candidatos en el proceso poltico, an cuando hayan
pasado la mayor parte de sus vidas en el sector privado, como el resto de
nosotros.
<dd>                Como resultado tendramos una democracia ms vigorosa, con
la participacin de candidatos con los ms variados antecedentes y
experiencias, tomando parte en elecciones ms competitivas.
En 1968, Eugene McCarthy pudo lanzar su candidatura a la presidencia porque
unos pocos opositores a la guerra en Vietnam, con mucho dinero,
contribuyeron cientos de miles de dlares a su campaa. Si los actuales
lmites a las contribuciones hubieran estado entonces vigentes, los millones
de ciudadanos opuestos a la guerra no hubieran tenido un vocero y Lyndon
Johnson hubiera ido a la reeleccin. No es el papel de las leyes electorales
cambiar la historia.
<dd>                Como el Sr. McCarthy sostuvo: "Nuestros prceres de la
independencia arriesgaron 'sus vidas, sus fortunas y su sagrado honor en la
batalla por la libertad'. No dijeron 'sus vidas y sus fortunas hasta $1000'".&copy

<title>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO
</h2>
Porfirio Cristaldo A.*<br>
<p>
ASUNCION (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- La depredacin del bosque nativo en el Paraguay avanza a
ritmo pavoroso. Su total desaparicin se estima entre 5 y 7 aos. Miles de
hectreas boscosas son segadas diariamente e hileras de camiones cargados de
troncos cruzan las fronteras sin pausa, pese a las leyes ambientales que
proscriben la tala de rboles y prohiben su exportacin. 
<p>
Los legisladores reprochan al gobierno por la masiva destruccin de
los bosques, el trfico ilegal de madera y la creciente contaminacin de
ros y arroyos. Exigen el acatamiento de las leyes ambientales, proponen
crear un Ministerio del Medio Ambiente y sancionar leyes ms estrictas, con
elevadas multas y penas carcelarias para los infractores. Pero la
experiencia mundial muestra su equivocacin. No son ms leyes, ni penas ms
duras, ni ms burcratas lo que se precisa para conservar los bosques, sino
proteger la propiedad privada. Paradjicamente, fue el populismo de la
Legislatura en los ltimos aos lo que aceler la deforestacin. Toda
nuestra legislacin atenta contra el bosque.
<p>
        Las leyes de la Reforma Agraria califican al bosque como "latifundio
improductivo", sujeto a expropiacin confiscatoria para su posterior reparto
a campesinos "sin tierra". Supuestamente, los bosques no satisfacen la
"funcin social" de la propiedad. Y por ello los propietarios buscan
deshacerse de sus bosques transformndolos en pastos para el ganado. Por el
apuro, ante la amenaza de expropiacin, las maderas se queman en el
desmonte, sin importar la prdida de materiales de construccin, postes para
cercados y lea. 
<p>
        Pero el peligro no es slo de expropiacin; tambin est la invasin
de los "sin tierra", entre los que hay verdaderos "industriales" de la
deforestacin y el abigeo. Estos invaden nicamente los bosques, y no
precisamente por su fertilidad, sino porque constituyen una fuente inmediata
de ingresos. La primera actividad de los "sin tierra" es la tala del bosque
y venta de troncos. Buena parte del contrabando maderero financia las
invasiones de tierras y en muchos casos constituyen el nico inters de los
"sin tierra". No es fcil sobrevivir en regiones remotas esperando la venta
de las primeras cosechas. Los invasores talan y se van.
<p>
        Para el propietario, la mejor defensa contra la invasin de sus
tierras es la deforestacin, eliminando su principal atractivo. El
formidable costo de derribar y quemar la selva se justifica an ms por el
hecho que el bosque no sirve de mucho, pues las leyes ambientales intentan
"protegerlo" de su dueo. 
<p>
        Al propietario le est prohibido cortar sus rboles y venderlos sin
previa autorizacin del Ministerio de Agricultura, ajustndose a un Plan de
Explotacin forestal. Para el dueo, esta restriccin le resta valor al
bosque. A nadie le interesa cuidar o preservar un recurso cuyo uso el
gobierno puede disponer arbitrariamente. Mejor no tener bosques. Las leyes
de proteccin ambiental se suman as a los peligros de la invasin y
fomentan una rpida deforestacin. El gobierno activamente destruye lo que
pretende proteger. 
<p>
        Las restricciones a la exportacin, rezago de la fracasada "teora
de la dependencia" que consideraba imprescindible exportar bienes con "valor
agregado", limita, a su vez, el valor de los troncos al pequeo mercado
interno. Liberalizar la exportacin eliminara el contrabando y elevara el
precio de la madera al nivel internacional. Acaso esto aumentara la
deforestacin? No. Los bajos precios actuales destruyen el inters de
preservar el bosque y eliminan toda inversin en reforestar. El aumento del
precio de la madera incentivara su conservacin y eficiente explotacin.  
<p>
        En una economa libre es el propietario el ms interesado en
preservar sus bosques. Incluso hoy, las depredaciones ms severas las sufren
los Parques Nacionales, que al ser de todos no son de nadie. Intensificar
las regulaciones y controles como proponen legisladores y burcratas
paraguayos no slo agravar la deforestacin sino tambin el desempleo y la
miseria. 
<p>
        Los bosques nativos, alrededor del 10% del territorio paraguayo,
deberan declararse por ley "no aptos" para la reforma agraria. Frenar la
deforestacin requiere derogar las leyes ambientales y las restricciones al
comercio de troncos, restableciendo la propiedad privada. Nadie mejor que su
dueo cuida lo suyo.

<TITLE>Falcoff: LatinoAmerica Vista Desde Washington -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LATINOAMERICA VISTA DESDE WASHINGTON</H2>
Mark Falcoff*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Para Amrica Latina, las noticias de nuestra campaa
presidencial son buenas y malas. Por segunda vez, en muchos aos, el tpico
de la regin no es decisivo, pero a la vez no hay razones particulares para
que los latinoamericanos teman, deseen la victoria o la derrota de uno de
los candidatos.
<dd>
Se trata de un viejo problema en las relaciones hemisfricas. Estados
Unidos es criticado por tomarlos demasiado en cuenta ("intervenir") o por
abandonar a Amrica Latina. En esta ocasin la ausencia de debate sobre
Amrica Latina podra verse como una seal positiva, por haberse alcanzado
un consenso respecto a la regin en cuanto a "democracia, libre mercado y
mayor intercambio comercial".
<dd>
Pero quedan asuntos pendientes. El primero es la expansin del TLC/NAFTA.
Chile ya debera pertenecer. Esa era la intencin de la administracin
Clinton hasta que colaps el peso mexicano. Mientras Mxico no se recupere
econmicamente (y vuelva a consumir inmensas cantidades de productos
estadounidenses) ser difcil que algn presidente de este pas arriesgue
capital poltico haciendo avanzar el proceso de integracin.
<dd>
Los latinoamericanos estn sorprendidos de lo sucedido con Chile, pas que
ha debido preceder a Mxico. Pero para la mayora de estadounidenses Mxico
representa el hemisferio; pocos han ido ms al sur. Los fracasos de Mxico
han sido proyectados a toda la regin. Eso es injusto y por ello Brasil y
Argentina tendrn que esperar entre cuatro y ocho aos. Lo positivo es que
ello ha ayudado a acelerar la integracin regional. La prxima vez que un
presidente de Estados Unidos decida patrocinar a un nuevo miembro del
TLC/NAFTA bien podra ser Mercosur.
<dd>
El nico candidato antilatinoamericano fue Pat Buchanan en las primarias
republicanas, quien gan en apenas un estado. Aunque las corrientes
contrarias al libre comercio persisten en ambos partidos, la tendencia es
favorable a Amrica Latina.
<dd>
El asunto de las drogas es ms conflictivo, pero esto tampoco cambiar
mucho segn el ocupante de la Casa Blanca. El argumento de la legalizacin,
elocuentemente presentado por personas con las ms variadas posiciones
polticas, no ha calado. Y la controversia encuentra su centro de gravedad
en el proceso de certificacin, a travs del cual el Departamento de Estado
cumple con el ritual anual de informar al Congreso y al presidente sobre las
naciones latinoamericanas que estn haciendo todo lo posible para combatir
la produccin y el despacho de drogas ilegales. No hay que ser muy cnico
para dudar que ese proceso de certificacin tenga algo que ver con el mundo
real.
<dd>
Andrs Oppenheimer lo explica muy bien en su ltimo libro. Poco antes de
las eleccin de Zedillo, la polica federal mexicana incaut 8 toneladas en
un jet Caravelle que hizo un aterrizaje de emergencia. Seis toneladas
desaparecieron y parte de los mismos paquetes fueron incautados por las
autoridades de Estados Unidos en la frontera. Aparentemente, el decomiso de
2 toneladas fue cantidad suficiente para ganarle a Mxico la certificacin
ese ao. Es una decisin significativa ante la descertificacin de Colombia
y la suspensin de la visa al presidente Samper, lo cual ha sido
profundamente traumtico para los colombianos, ya que la descertificacin
conlleva modestas pero altamente simblicas sanciones comerciales.
<dd>
La tercera cuestin pendiente es la inmigracin, algo muy complejo y
emocional. Algunas naciones dependen del dinero que remiten desde Estados
Unidos a familiares. No es probable que Mxico, por ejemplo, hubiera
sobrevivido el colapso financiero sin el dinero enviado a familiares desde
aqu. Otro dramtico ejemplo es el de la dispora salvadorea.
<dd>
La posicin latinoamericana respecto a la inmigracin es prudente y moral.
Muchos pases insisten que la inmigracin es un derecho humano universal.
As piensa Mxico, pero sin respetarle tal derecho a los guatemaltecos. Por
el contrario, la posicin de Estados Unidos ha sido irracional y poco
realista. No hay consenso nacional sobre el tema. La Proposicin 187 y la
legislacin patrocinada por republicanos para negar educacin y dems
servicios pblicos a nios ilegales son absurdas ante el hecho que el pas
no est dispuesto a hacer deportaciones masivas. La tarea es integrar a los
indocumentados, especialmente a sus hijos. Si los costos parecen
prohibitivos ahora, sern mucho mayores en el futuro. El tema, sin embargo,
no ha sido seriamente discutido en la campaa electoral.
<dd>
Indudablemente que el fantasma de la intervencin en Hait acosar al
prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca porque el presidente Ren Preval no tiene
fuerza para imponer decisiones econmicas cruciales. Un mnimo de orden
pblico depende de la presencia de las fuerzas de la ONU, las cuales se
retirarn en uno o dos aos.
<dd>
El PRI bien puede perder las elecciones legislativas en Mxico y, en
cualquier caso, el sistema poltico mexicano enfrenta cambios fundamentales.
Por otra parte, Castro puede decidir vengarse de la Ley Helms-Burton
lanzando flotillas de balseros si no este verano, el ao que viene.
<dd>
Prximamente los estadounidenses tendrn que negociar un nuevo tratado con
Panam, permitiendo que permanezcan tropas all. Bajo el Tratado
Carter-Torrijos de 1978, todas las fuerzas militares estadounidenses deben
marcharse antes del fin del siglo. Los panameos que antes estaban ansiosos
de salir de los gringos han decidido ahora que su presencia es una pliza de
seguro que atrae inversiones y capital extranjero. Estados Unidos, por su
parte, tendr que decidir si quiere la responsabilidad de asegurar la
estabilidad poltica panamea.
<dd>
En conclusin, habr mucho en la agenda latinoamericana de la nueva
administracin. Quizs es positivo que estos temas no se politicen durante
la campaa.

<h2>
LA ARGENTINA DESPUES DE CAVALLO
</h2>     
Mark Falcoff*<P>
<BR>
WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Pocos funcionarios en la historia de Amrica Latina han
gozado de la reputacin internacional -y del poder interno- de Domingo
Cavallo, hasta hace poco ministro de Economa. Con su salida comienza una
nueva era en la poltica argentina.
<P>
 Durante 5  6 aos, el equipo Menem-Cavallo tuvo extraordinario xito no
slo en frenar una inflacin galopante sino en restaurar la confianza
internacional respecto a la economa argentina. Ello suministr un cojn
poltico no disfrutado antes por ningn otro gobierno en la Argentina y
Menem al centrar su campaa por la reeleccin del ao pasado en la
estabilidad monetaria logr aumentar en dos puntos, a 51%, su participacin
en el voto popular. Hoy, las encuestas sealan una aprobacin por Menem de
apenas 20%.
<P>
 Cmo el poltico ms exitoso en la Argentina desde Pern (fundador de su
partido) ha sufrido tan dramtica cada en la aprobacin popular? La
contestacin corta es que los argentinos dan como un hecho la estabilidad
monetaria y ahora tienen prioridades diferentes, como el desempleo que
alcanza marcas sin precedentes. Otros asuntos preocupan tambin, como el
alto costo de la vida, la criminalidad y un sistema judicial corrupto e
ineficiente. Los argentinos quieren un gobierno ms serio, algo
aparentemente imposible para Menem.
<P>
 Rumores de corrupcin hacen muy difcil la labor del nuevo ministro de
Economa. La actitud general parece ser que si el gobierno roba y derrocha
los recursos, porqu voy a pagar impuestos? Esta reaccin explica en parte
la cada masiva de recursos anunciada por el sucesor de Cavallo, Roque
Fernndez, en su primer discurso televisado.
<P>
 El primer reto del pobre Fernndez es explicar a los argentinos que el
dficit fiscal es mucho mayor que el anunciado por Cavallo, el cual
alcanzar este ao $6.600 millones (un peso = un dlar). Para reducirlo, el ministro 
anunci una serie de nuevos impuestos, la rebaja del ingreso sujeto
al impuesto sobre la renta y la extensin a 65 aos para que las mujeres
sean pensionadas. Peor todava, Fernndez anunci aranceles a repuestos y
equipos que reducirn la rentabilidad de muchas de las fbricas modernas.
<P>
 Tales medidas draconianas que reducirn el nivel de vida de la aporreada
clase media se presentan como necesarias en la defensa de la paridad
peso/dlar, pero as slo podemos esperar ms de lo mismo: ningn incremento
en el empleo ni reactivacin econmica. Por ello muchos peronistas se estn
distanciando de Fernndez y del presidente Menem.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la oposicin sigue dividida. La tradicional oposicin al
peronismo ha sido la Unin Cvica Radical, pero los argentinos recuerdan la
hiperinflacin sufrida durante la administracin del presidente radical Ral
Alfonsn (1983-1989), la cual lo oblig a renunciar con siete meses de
anticipacin al trmino de su perodo. Para horror de los radicales,
Alfonsn inform a la prensa en agosto que no haba abandonado totalmente la
idea de candidatearse nuevamente.
<P>
 La esperanza radical es el nuevo alcalde de Buenos Aires, donde vive un
tercio de la poblacin del pas. Fernando de la Rua, elegido en julio,
disfruta de 63% de aprobacin en las encuestas. El fue congresista por ms
de 20 aos y tiene reputacin de hombre decente y honrado, algo raro en la
poltica argentina. Pero no le gusta arriesgarse ni tomar decisiones
difciles y ser retado por dos miembros del ala izquierda de su partido,
Rodolfo Terragno (actual presidente del partido) y el congresista Federico
Storani.
<P>
 Desde 1993 surgi una tercera fuerza izquierdista con Frepaso, cuyo
candidato presidencial en 1995, Jos Octavio Bordn, qued en segundo lugar.
Pero en la eleccin del alcalde de Buenos Aires obtuvieron resultados
decepcionantes y Bordn anunci su retiro de la poltica. Frepaso no es un
partido sino una coalicin de grupos disimilares unidos en contra del statu
quo y actualmente organiza una serie de apagones, bocinazos y cacerolazos.
 Argentina ha sufrido una cada en su nivel de vida en los ltimos dos aos
y la oposicin comparte el odio hacia Menem, su familia, sus allegados y sus
polticas econmicas. La esperanza de que un inmenso influjo de inversiones
extranjeras absorberan el desempleo generado por las privatizaciones no se
ha hecho realidad. No sucedi porque muchos de esos ex empleados pblicos no
son capaces de convertirse en trabajadores productivos. Durante 50 aos el
objetivo del gobierno fue el pleno empleo aun con el deterioro de los
sueldos. El sistema educacional es obsoleto y no est preparado para formar
trabajadores en la era de la computacin.
<P>
 Menem ha sido presidente por siete aos, por ms tiempo que cualquier otro
excepto Pern. Duerme largas siestas y toma extensas vacaciones en el
exterior. Apenas aparece la oportunidad de un viaje sale con 100
acompaantes. Sin embargo, en el pasado ha sorprendido tanto a amigos como a
enemigos con su capacidad de enfocar y dominar situaciones difciles. Tendr
que repetirlo pronto, si es que piensa dejar una buena situacin cuando
termine su mandato dentro de tres aos. &copy;

<title>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL? -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL?
</h2>
Mark Falcoff*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En octubre los brasileos votarn por alcaldes y
miembros de los concejos municipales, siendo estas elecciones la primera
prueba confrontada por Fernando Henrique Cardoso desde que fue electo
presidente hace dos aos. Tambin ser una indicacin de apoyo o rechazo a
su anunciado programa de liberalizacin y reforma econmica.
<P>
Dos hechos ayudan a comprender mejor al Brasil. Uno es su parecido con
Estados Unidos respecto al tamao, autonoma propia, concentracin en sus
asuntos internos, con culturas e idiomas diferentes al resto de Amrica. En
ninguna otra nacin latinoamericana se oye a la gente hablar acerca de su
pas como un gran poder del futuro. Lo mismo que los estadounidenses, los
brasileos tienen que buscar la manera de reinventar su gobierno.
<p>
A pesar de mltiples problemas, las estadsticas brasileas son
impresionantes, comenzando con que es la novena economa ms grande del
mundo. Su comercio internacional alcanz casi $80.000 millones en 1995,
colocndolo en el lugar N 23. Sus recursos naturales son imn de
inversiones extranjeras.
<p>
El tipo de centrismo poltico representado por Cardoso (culturalmente de
izquierda, pero econmicamente ligeramente a la derecha del centro) se
parece algo a la posicin del presidente Clinton. No es de extraar,
entonces, que hayan hecho buena amistad, lo mismo que sus esposas, quienes
son activistas polticas.
<p>
Cardoso a la fecha ha tenido un xito modesto. Su credibilidad poltica se
seguir basando en el xito del Plan Real que en efecto liga la moneda
brasilea al dlar. Tambin logr la promulgacin de la mejor ley protectora
de la propiedad intelectual en la regin. Pero las reformas cruciales a los
impuestos, a la asistencia y seguro social siguen esperando laaprobacin del
Congreso.
<p>
A lo contrario del resto del hemisferio, el presidente brasileo es
relativamente dbil frente a un Congreso extraordinariamente poderoso. Y los
legisladores reflejan fielmente la extrema diversidad de ese inmenso pas,
por lo que en ausencia de un partido poderoso y disciplinado es muy difcil
alcanzar el consenso. Adems, la nueva Constitucin es un documento difcil
que imposibilita la efectividad gubernamental. Qu otra Constitucin
reglamenta el tiempo del descanso para tomar caf en las industrias? Al
supervisar todo aspecto de la vida econmica y social de la nacin, requiere
enmiendas constitucionales para cualquier cambio significativo. Hasta que se
logren algunas alteraciones es imposible permitir la participacin privada y
extranjera en petrleo, minera, electricidad y telecomunicaciones.
<p>
Los mismos obstculos se aplican a la eficiencia de los servicios pblicos
y a la privatizacin del Seguro Social. Pero sin esas reformas corre peligro
el Plan Real y un retorno a la hiperinflacin liquidara lo que queda del
poder poltico de Cardoso, a la vez que tendra catastrficos efectos tanto
para el Brasil como para sus vecinos.
<p>
La salud econmica del Brasil en gran medida determina el bienestar, no
slo de pases pequeos como Uruguay y Paraguay, sino tambin el de naciones
medianas como Argentina, Colombia y Per. Slo Venezuela, con sus masivas
reservas petroleras, sobrevivira el colapso de Brasil.
<p>
La importancia econmica de Brasil se manifiesta en el xito de Mercosur,
una rea de libre comercio que ya se extiende a Argentina, Paraguay y
Uruguay. Desde el colapso del peso mexicano y la paralizacin del TLC/NAFTA
hasta Chile ha aplicado para ingresar a Mercosur.
<p>
Pero las instituciones polticas brasileas se mantienen curiosamente
rezagadas en un pas que avanza en otros frentes. Las elecciones municipales
no son determinantes de las polticas nacionales, pero se consideran buen
termmetro del sentimiento nacional. Sin embargo, como lo indica Alexandre
Barros, los votantes que favorecen mayor desregulacin y ms privatizaciones
pueden castigar a la administracin Cardoso por su lentitud en esos campos.
Pero Barros tambin cree que los electores que quieren mayor intervencin
estatal tambin castigarn a un gobierno que perciben como neoliberal.
"Cara, yo gano", dice Barros, "sello, tu pierdes".
<p>
Es difcil evaluar las tendencias en un pas con una sociedad tan diversa y
rudimentaria. Pero a lo contrario de sus vecinos, los brasileos no optan
por soluciones extremistas. Eso le da al Brasil un aire superficial de
calma, aun cuando el crimen se dispara y la brecha entre ricos y pobres
sigue siendo inmensa.
<p>
El verdadero problema es que mientras la comunidad poltica brasilea no
est dispuesta a tomar decisiones difciles acerca de las reformas
econmicas, el pas puede perder su mnima estabilidad monetaria, de la que
depende tanto su poblacin como sus vecinos.

NICARAGUA: NUEVO CAPITULO

Mark Falcoff*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Arnoldo Alemn, ex alcalde de Managua y candidato de la
Alianza Liberal, derrot fcilmente al ex presidente sandinista, Daniel
Ortega, en las elecciones del 20 de octubre. La gran victoria de Alemn fue
una sorpresa, ya que las encuestas indicaban estar cabeza a cabeza. La
segunda derrota de Ortega en cinco aos es indicativa de que los
nicaragenses no desean regresar al pasado sandinista. Pero,
lamentablemente, los problemas del pas son muy graves para ser resueltos
por una eleccin.
<P>
 Lo que estaba de por medio en estas elecciones era ms sobre el pasado que
sobre el futuro. La victoria de Alemn es un rechazo al gobierno de la
presidenta Violeta Chamorro, no slo por su incapacidad en reactivar la
economa y detener la cada del nivel de vida sino tambin por su renuencia
a liquidar varios aspectos del legado sandinista. De hecho, se pueden
describir al menos tres de los ltimos cinco aos de gobierno como un caso
clsico de cohabitacin, con los sandinistas al control de las fuerzas
armadas y de la polica, a la vez que ejercan una considerable influencia,
tras bastidores, con arreglos sucios y privados con miembros del gobierno de
Chamorro.
<P>
 A raz de su victoria en 1990, a la Sra. Chamorro se le pidi exterminar el
virus sandinista, pero ella prefiri el camino de la reconciliacin y
pacificacin. Ahora que los sandinistas fueron nuevamente barridos
electoralmente, esa poltica de la presidenta Chamorro luce mejor.
<P>
 Un logro innegable ha sido la desmilitarizacin de la sociedad. Unos 22.000
contras entregaron sus armas y el ejrcito ha sido reducido de 96.000
hombres a 13.500. Tambin ha habido una reduccin paralela de los gastos
militares que en 1990 consuman 40% del presupuesto nacional. En parte, eso
ha ayudado a reducir los dficit del presupuesto y la astronmica inflacin.
Durante los ltimos cinco aos, Nicaragua ha vivido bajo un clima sin
precedente de libertad.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, los errores han sido tan grandes como los logros. Casi la
mitad de los prstamos prometidos a los contras y de los documentos de
propiedad de las tierra no han sido concedidos. Como resultado, repeticiones
de la violencia guerrillera han costado la vida de ms de mil nicaragenses.
Pero el problema ms serio es el estancamiento econmico, sufriendo la mitad
de la poblacin de desempleo crnico.
<P>
 La crisis proviene de la dcada de gobierno marxista que precipit una fuga
masiva de capitales y de los profesionales con la habilidad de gerenciar. La
mayora se fueron a Estados Unidos, donde sus hijos se han convertido en
residentes permanentes. Tomar un par de generaciones volver a crear el
capital humano que Nicaragua perdi.
<P>
 Pero el pobre rcord econmico del gobierno de Violeta Chamorro no es toda
culpa de sus antecesores. En su campaa electoral de 1990, Chamorro haba
prometido revisar las expropiaciones masivas efectuadas por los sandinistas
en propiedades tanto urbanas como del campo. Nunca lo encar y hasta bloque
las iniciativas de la Legislatura Nacional de al menos pagar una
compensacin a los expropiados.
<P>
 Sin una clara definicin de los derechos de propiedad, tanto el capital
nacional como el extranjero le seguirn sacando el cuerpo a la que fue una
de las ms vigorosas economas en Amrica Central.
<P>
 El fracaso de encarar la situacin ha envenenado la atmsfera nicaragense
y desde hace un ao ms de cien mil habitantes urbanos viven bajo la amenaza
de ser desalojados por los dueos que han regresado a reclamar sus
propiedades. Por otra parte, 24.000 demandas relacionadas a la confiscacin
de tierras siguen sin decidirse. Una ley de Estabilizacin de la Propiedad,
promulgada en noviembre de 1995, trat de partir la torta, aceptando la
reforma agraria sandinista, pero requiriendo la compensacin sobre
propiedades urbanas. No sorprendi a nadie que los propietarios no aceptasen
ser compensados con bonos de la semiprivatizada compaa de telfonos.
<P>
 Los que apoyaron a Alemn fueron tanto los que haban perdido sus
propiedades como los que estn inconformes ante la ausencia de oportunidades
econmicas. La campaa de Alemn tambin resalt el favoritismo familiar en
la distribucin de cargos y contratos gubernamentales.
<P>
 Pero hay ms que razones polticas y econmicas en la victoria de Alemn.
Hijo de una familia humilde, se ha sobrepuesto a prejuicios sociales
alcanzando el xito como empresario y luego como alcalde de la capital. Por
el contrario, quienes rodean a la Sra. Chamorro pertenencen a la
aristocracia tradicional nicaragense.
<P>
 El programa de Alemn incluye la revitalizacin de la economa a travs de
prstamos a los agricultores y a los empresarios pequeos. Tambin promete
invertir en la abandonada infraestructura de carreteras, puentes y dems
obras pblicas. Pero lo que Alemn ofreca distinto a Ortega son buenas
relaciones con Estados Unidos, lo cual los nicaragenses -con razn o sin
ella- piensan que es la clave en la recuperacin econmica.
<P>
 Lo nicas tampoco han olvidado "la piata", la reparticin de propiedades
gubernamentales durante las ltimas semanas del gobierno sandinista. As le
pusieron la mano a propiedades que algunos estiman en $200 millones y otros
en $2.000 millones, repartidas entre unos cinco mil sandinistas, en su
mayora funcionarios altos del rgimen. De esa manera Ortega cre una
"burguesa revolucionaria" a la mexicana, pero al mismo tiempo produjo una
inmensa brecha entre los sandinistas privilegiados y los comunes y corrientes. 
<P>
 Ortega trat de proyectar una nueva imagen, vistindose bien y eliminando
del himno sandinista aquello de que el gringo es "el peor enemigo de la
humanidad". Pero los nicas no creyeron en su repentino pluralismo, indicando
que sigue viajando frecuentemente a Cuba y que no hay evidencia de
democracia interna en su partido. De hecho, el partido se dividi al
separarse el ex vicepresidente Sergio Ramrez. Es significativo que la
mayora de los legisladores sandinistas se han ido con Ramrez.
<P>
 La poltica nica hoy se caracteriza por su divisin en tres "familias", en
s fraccionadas: el sandinismo, el antisandinismo y el grupo ms pequeo que
puede designarse como conservadora y que apoy a Chamorro. Ms del 60% es
antisandinista, pero entre ellos algunos quieren un rompimiento con el
pasado y otros favorecen un gobierno en manos de las mismas familias que han
dominado la poltica durante un siglo. La victoria de Alemn es importante
al representar el deseo por una nueva sntesis.
<P>
 Alemn se enfrenta a todas las patologas de la regin: radical desigualdad
y la tendencia a confundir los bienes privados y pblicos. No es fcil ser
optimista, pero al menos el electorado escogi bien.

<h2>
HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Milton Friedman*
</a>

<P>
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA (AIPE).- La experiencia de Hong Kong contradice el
falso dogma de Pat Buchanan de que el proteccionismo beneficia a los
trabajadores y promueve el crecimiento econmico.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poco despus de la Segunda Guerra, al mismo tiempo que Gran Bretaa
instrumentaba polticas socialistas, una de sus ltimas colonias -Hong Kong-
daba un vuelco hacia el total libre mercado, iniciando un experimento
ilustrativo de los resultados opuestos producidos por el mercado libre y el
mercado controlado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por algn accidente de carcter oficial, la oficina colonial britnica
design a John Cowperthwaite, un escocs estudioso de Adam Smith, como
secretario financiero de Hong Kong. A las polticas de libre mercado de
Cowperthwaite se les acredita haber producido el milagro econmico que
condujo a un fenomenal crecimiento del nivel de vida promedio, a pesar de
que la poblacin se multiplic diez veces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es difcil concebir un reto ms severo a las polticas de libre mercado.
Hong Kong es una isla pobre en recursos naturales ms all de su gran
puerto. Cuando los comunistas se aduearon de China, olas de refugiados
llegaban huyendo slo con las posesiones que podan cargar. Ellos y los que
los siguieron produjeron un rpido incremento de la poblacin. Hong Kong
prcticamente no recibi ayuda extranjera para asimilar a estas hordas de
refugiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a estas adversas circunstancias, la salvacin de Hong Kong han sido
sus polticas de libre comercio y libre mercado, basados en ningn arancel a
las importaciones ni ningn subsidio u otro tipo de privilegio concedido a
las exportaciones. Las muy pocas restricciones que se han impuesto, como el
acuerdo sobre textiles multifibras, se deben a presiones aplicadas por
Estados Unidos y algunos otros pases. Pero no se fijan los precios ni los
salarios; hay mnimas restricciones al inicio de actividades comerciales y
tanto los gastos del gobierno como los impuestos se han mantenido bajos. La
tasa tope del impuesto personal a las rentas es 25%, con un promedio mximo
de 15%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las condiciones eran ttricas al principio, pero rpidamente comenzaron a
mejorar y han seguido mejorando hasta hoy. Para 1960, el Producto Interno
Bruto per cpita (en precios de 1995) era de $2.247, o sea menos de una
tercera parte del de Gran Bretaa entonces, que era de $7.906. Para 1994 la
situacin se haba revertido. El ingreso per cpita en Hong Kong se haba
multiplicado casi por ocho, hasta alcanzar $17.832 y era ya 30% superior al
de Gran Bretaa, el cual alcanzaba $13.340. Realmente un milagro econmico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es irnico que la colonia floreci, a pesar de todas las circunstancias
adversas, al seguir polticas diametralmente opuestas a la de su madre
patria, mientras Inglaterra permaneca estancada. El Instituto Fraser del
Canad acaba de publicar una clasificacin, segn la libertad econmica, de
ms de cien pases en 1995. Hong Kong est en primer puesto; Estados Unidos
en el cuarto y Gran Bretaa en el sexto. Ms sorprendente an es que el
ingreso per cpita de Hong Kong es apenas 5% ms bajo que el de Estados Unidos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Qu contraste con la experiencia de casi todas las ex colonias britnicas
que obtuvieron su libertad despus de la Segunda Guerra. Y qu estupenda
prueba de que el libre comercio y el libre mercado favorecen mucho ms a la
gente comn y corriente que el "proteccionismo" del Sr. Buchanan o el "justo
intercambio" del presidente Clinton. La "justicia comercial" depende de
quin la mire, mientras que el veredicto del libre comercio est en manos
del mercado. Por algo la palabra "libre" aparece mencionada tres veces en
nuestra Declaracin de Independencia y una vez en la primera enmienda
constitucional, al igual que la palabra "libertad". Pero la palabra "justo"
no aparece en ninguno de esos documentos redactados por nuestros prceres.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, el milagro de Hong Kong va a ser seriamente daado si no
destruido cuando los comunistas le pongan la mano el ao prximo.

<h2>
VENEZUELA Y LA PRIVATIZACION
</h2>

Oscar Garca M.*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Para que en Venezuela podamos vivir en un Estado de
derecho, con una economa libre de mercado, el gobierno debe despojarse de
las empresas industriales, comerciales y bancarias. En sus manos no
funcionan y producen prdidas en lugar de beneficios.
<dd>	Un reciente estudio indica que entre 1970 y 1995 se realizaron
transferencias fiscales de alrededor de cien mil millones de dlares a las
empresas estatales de Guayana (acero, aluminio y energa elctrica). La
magnitud de esa cifra supera nuestra capacidad de comprensin. Pero si
hacemos slo dos comparaciones nos daremos cuenta de su dimensin. La
capitalizacin burstil, de la totalidad de las compaas que se cotizan en
la Bolsa de Valores de Caracas, a mayo de 1996, es de cinco mil   millones
de dlares, aproximadamente. O sea, que con esos cien mil millones de
dlares se hubiesen podido comprar 20 veces todas las acciones de todas las
compaas inscritas (las de Venezolana de Cementos, La Electricidad de
Caracas, Banco Provincial, Sivensa, Manpa, Mantex, etc.). Inslito, no es
verdad?
<dd>	Otra comparacin: al cierre de abril de 1996, la totalidad de los depsitos
en los bancos, tanto pblicos como privados, ascenda a 6.945 mil millones
de dlares. Esos cien mil millones en transferencias equivalen a ms de 14
veces los depsitos de la banca venezolana.
<dd>	Y, en qu se invirtieron? Pues en empresas que hoy da muy poco valen
(pues sus prdidas son inmensas y su ineficiencia proverbial), pero
sirvieron y sirven para algo mucho ms importante, apoyar al sistema de
privilegios, favores, ddivas y quin sabe cuntas cosas ms en que se basa
el sistema poltico venezolano.
<dd>	Al privatizarse esas empresas que los polticos denominan "bsicas y
estratgicas" casi como por acto de magia desaparecern las transferencias
y, ms importante an, se comenzar a tener un grupo de empresas productivas
y se estimular el mercado de capitales.
<dd>	Este punto es de especial importancia. En Venezuela no hay medios
suficientes de canalizacin de los ahorros. Si hoy fuera aprobada una Ley de
Fondo de Pensiones similar a la instituida en Chile hace 15 aos, con gran
xito y en beneficio de los trabajadores, habra mucha dificultad en poder
colocar esos fondos en el sector privado y podra el gobierno con facilidad
caer en la tentacin de absorberlos para continuar financiando sus dficit.
<dd>	Un ejemplo de la bondad de la inversin en privatizaciones: recientemente
el Sunday Times de Londres public un reportaje donde analiza las
privatizaciones inglesas y afirma que si alguien invirti 1.000 libras
esterlinas en cada una de las 20 mayores privatizaciones, tendra hoy da
una cartera con un valor de 140.000 libras esterlinas. Lo cual es una muy
buena ganancia. El promedio de retorno de las compaas privatizadas es de
599%, que supera al promedio del Financial Times que fue para el mismo
perodo de 354%.
<dd>	La privatizacin es buena para todos, pero resulta muy difcil superar los
obstculos polticos y an ms los personales y partidistas de sus
opositores. Poco a poco la opinin pblica impulsar esos cambios.&copy

<TITLE>Garcia: VeNezuela: Petroleo y Miseria -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>VENEZUELA: PETROLEO Y MISERIA</H2>
Oscar Garca M.*<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace slo 14 aos, en 1982, el venezolano que tena un
billete de 500 bolvares en el bolsillo poda cambiarlo en cualquier banco
por $116,28. Ahora ese mismo billete de 500 bolvares apenas vale $1,05,
menos de cien veces. Este proceso de devaluacin e inflacin resulta
inexplicable en un pas dotado de una riqueza petrolera casi sin fin. El
petrleo no fue sembrado, como hace 60 aos propuso hacer Arturo Uslar
Pietri, en un editorial del diario Ahora. Por el contrario ha sido utilizado
para subsidiar las crisis.
<dd>
No hemos logrado con los ingresos del petrleo construir una economa
moderna y productiva. Al contrario, al haber sido manejados los recursos
petroleros por el Estado, se han malbaratado y despilfarrado de tal manera
que la Venezuela de hoy puede ser definida con dos palabras contrapuestas:
"petrleo y miseria".
<dd>
Siguen ingresando cantidades asombrosas de dinero provenientes de las
exportaciones petroleras -para este ao ms de $20.000 millones-, lo cual
sera ms que suficiente para 23 millones de habitantes que slo importan
bienes y servicios por alrededor de $8.000 millones. Pero el  nivel de
pobreza alcanza  80% de la poblacin. Un absurdo imperdonable.
<dd>
El Estado recibe los ingresos y en lugar de utilizarlos para sentar las
bases de un crecimiento sostenido, los despilfarra en una enorme burocracia
ineficiente, una industria estatizada y un aparato clientelar.
<dd>
Aunque los ingresos petroleros seran ms que suficientes para cubrir las
necesidades financieras del gobierno, a nuestros polticos les resultan
insuficientes y el Estado recurre al incremento en los impuestos para cubrir
infinitas necesidades. Los impuestos son un mal necesario, pues destruyen
riqueza, extinguen incentivos y deben ser siempre usados para gastos
estrictamente necesarios: la seguridad (que no hay), justicia (casi
inexistente), defensa, relaciones internacionales, educacin y salud.
<dd>
En casi todos esos rubros los gobiernos venezolanos no han sido capaces de
prestar servicios razonables; al contrario, han hecho colapsar algunos que
en su momento fueron tolerables.
<dd>
Ahora, cuando el mundo entero est de regreso y ha sido ampliamente
comprobado que las altas tasas impositivas, en lugar de aumentar, reducen
los ingresos fiscales, se empea nuestro gobierno en aumentar fuertemente
las cargas a una poblacin ya exhausta.
<dd>
El impuesto inflacionario que ha azotado a los venezolanos entre 1976 y
1995 es de 9.494%. El impuesto inflacionario desde 1994 a mayo de 1996 es de
288,59%. La inflacin genera una transferencia de riquezas tremendamente
injusta, especialmente de los ms dbiles y pobres al gobierno. Los ms
ricos se protegen de la inflacin con inversiones inmobiliarias y cuentas en
el extranjero.
<dd>
Los ingresos petroleros de Venezuela han continuado aumentando y por
diversas circunstancias seguirn hacindolo, facilitando a los polticos
postergar reformas estructurales fundamentales y necesarias, como lo son la
creacin del Estado de derecho y las esencialsimas privatizaciones. 
<dd>
La voluntad poltica para realizar cambios estructurales bajo la anunciada
Agenda Venezuela ya comienza a flaquear, segn el propio ministro de
Planificacin Teodoro Petkoff. De ser as, la Venezuela del futuro seguir
siendo la misma de hoy: mucho petrleo y mucha miseria.
<dd>
Para cambiar y prosperar -y puede lograrse esto con relativa rapidez- es
necesario reducir el tamao del Estado privatizando, dejando en manos de la
iniciativa privada el manejo del aparato productivo del pas. Este proceso,
aparentemente traumtico para quienes han vivido tantos aos bajo ambientes
populistas e intervencionistas, es la solucin tanto de corto como de largo
plazo, que permitir bajar la inflacin, crear empleos y desarrollar la
productividad, devolvindole as a la nacin venezolana su optimismo y
bienestar.

COLERA Y EL IMPERIALISMO SANITARIO

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
LIMA (AIPE).- En enero de 1991 se declar una epidemia de clera en el Per
que le cost la vida a cerca de 20.000 personas en cinco aos y afect a
otras 310.000. La epidemia se propag por 14 pases del continente americano
hasta llegar a convertirse, segn la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud, en la
sptima pandemia ms letal de este siglo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Pese a su virulencia, las causas de esta epidemia han estado rodeadas de
un sospechoso misterio. Generalmente se asocian con la ingestin de pescado
contaminado en algunos puertos peruanos del Pacfico, especficamente
Chimbote y Chancay, donde empez la epidemia. Se sealan como causas tambin
la insuficiencia de servicios de agua potable y defectos en la red que la
provee.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ello no obstante, las ms recientes investigaciones revelan un hecho
aterrador. Al parecer, la causa del clera fue la reduccin de la cantidad
de cloro en el agua dispuesta por el gobierno peruano como consecuencia de
los consejos de la Agencia de Proteccin Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA,
por sus siglas en ingls).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Segn un informe de la Organizacin Panamericana de la Salud,
aparentemente se habra reducido a 0,2 miligramos por litro la cantidad de
cloro que los acueductos peruanos aadan al agua. El promedio internacional
ponderado es de 0,3 miligramos por litro. Como el Per no se encuentra en la
media de salubridad y su infraestructura sanitaria es deficiente, el nivel
ptimo hubiera estado ms bien entre 0,35 y 0,4 miligramos por litro. Sin
embargo, como los grupos ecolgicos han persuadido a la EPA de que el cloro
causa cncer, especialmente cuando se descompone en trialometanos al
contacto con materia orgnica, la autoridades estadounidenses recomiendan
una reduccin del cloro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tratando de colocarse a la vanguardia de la tecnologa, los burcratas
peruanos habran seguido la recomendacin de los ambientalistas durante
1990, creando una reduccin de la barrera qumica contra las enfermedades en
el agua potable, de suerte que en enero de 1991 se declar la epidemia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Aparentemente lo que sucedi fue que los funcionarios peruanos quisieron
ponerse en la moda ecolgica y convirtieron en "verde" el agua potable. Pero
era el verde de la contaminacin. El verde del clera. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata, pues, de una lamentable y trgica negligencia que va a dar lugar
a mltiples escndalos. De hecho existe una inexcusable irresponsabilidad de
los funcionarios peruanos que mancha con un crimen ms al gobierno de Alan
Garca. Pero es tambin cierto que la responsabilidad de las autoridades
norteamericanas se hace inocultable, al extremo de abrirse posibilidades de
que los familiares de los muertos por el clera enjuicien al gobierno
norteamericano para conseguir una justa indemnizacin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La EPA se convertira as en responsable de uno de los genocidios ms
grandes de la historia del continente americano; el cual, vista la
persistente campaa que ella hace para suprimir el cloro del agua en Estados
Unidos y otros pases del mundo, se convierte en una trgica advertencia. La
comunidad internacional no puede permitir que la demagogia y la
irresponsabilidad ecologista destruyan los precarios logros de la salubridad
pblica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Este caso es, ciertamente, una tragedia, pero ensea cmo las inadecuadas
recomendaciones de los ecologistas pueden hacer dao, al extremo de condenar
a muerte a decenas de miles de personas. Los prejuicios ideolgicos pueden
convertirse fcilmente en armas letales cuando se convierten en regulaciones
pblicas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Probablemente el cloro tiene ciertos riesgos, pero un anlisis de
costo/beneficio no puede hacerse en este caso entre el cncer y el no cncer
solamente, sino entre el cncer y el clera. No vaya a ser que por pretender
alcanzar un futuro "polticamente correcto" regresemos al ms aterrador de
los pasados.

<h2>
MANUAL DE IDIOTAS
</h2>

Enrique Ghersi*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Todo empez en el bar del hotel don Pancho de Benidorm, en el
sur de Espaa. Las Primeras Jornadas Liberales Iberoamericanas organizadas
en Espaa por el peruano Fernando Iwasaki haban convocado a un grupo de
intelectuales para discutir sobre la situacin de la libertad en el mundo.
Al final de los debates, cuando un grupo liderado por Plinio Apuleyo
Mendoza, Carlos Alberto Montaner y Alvaro Vargas Llosa miraba la televisin,
el noticiero dio cuenta de que el futbolista argentino Diego Maradona, de
visita en Cuba, se haba proclamado admirador y partidario acrrimo de Fidel
Castro.
<dd>	Apenas se inform de ello, Plinio estall en furia. Carlos Alberto calcul,
casi de inmediato, los millones de dlares que Maradona poda haberse
embolsado con este golpe de efecto. Y Alvaro, ms agresivo an, sostuvo la
necesidad de despegar de inmediato una campaa internacional dirigida a
denunciar los excesos de la intelligentsia latinoamericana, en el supuesto
asaz dudoso de que el futbolista la integrase.
<dd>	La primera vez que o la frase fue cuando, hastiado ya por la indignacin,
Montaner sostuvo que el futbolista era el prototipo del "idiota
latinoamericano". Esa especie de bpedo impune capaz de sostener sin el
menor reparo la verdad de perogrullo o trivialidad de moda, a cambio de
aparentar ser una persona informada y seria.
<dd>	Hoy los tres escritores nos ofrecen una versin, polmica y apasionada de
este problema con su "Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano" que,
publicado por Plaza & Janes, acaba de ser presentado en diferentes capitales
del continente por una gira trashumante de los autores.
<dd>	La intelectualidad latinoamericana ha estado influenciada por los
arquetipos. Renunciando a su creatividad y no queriendo ver sus indudables
aportes, el tpico intelectual de nuestro continente es aquel que se conduce
por la moda europea, al abrigo del temperamento norteamericano y con la
reminiscencia tnica suficiente. Este personaje recorre nuestra historia sin
el menor inters por la realidad. Slo se fija en el prejuicio, generalmente
el suyo propio, sentenciando a cada rato una media verdad en torno de la
cual construye un conjunto de falsas proposiciones.
<dd>	Domina la sociologa. Sabe antropologa y economa. Escribe versos y es
oportunista. Nuestro idiota es un personaje admirado y temido. Su opinin
predomina en los crculos acadmicos, resulta apreciada en los polticos y
remunerada en los empresariales. Todo perfectamente contradictorio con su
presumida modestia. Hace ya tiempo que se necesitaba un detenido estudio de
tan notable fenmeno.
<dd>	El "Manual" es un libro de combate, llamado a crear polmica y a refutar
-con sarcasmo y aguda crtica- los lugares comunes y las verdades de
perogrullo ms usuales de la intelectualidad latinoamericana.
<dd>	Primero cataloga errores. Luego los formaliza, exponindolos suscintamente
a fin de refutarlos a continuacin. Posteriormente derriba mitos sin dejar
ttere con cabeza, incluidos Gustavo Gutirrez, Eduardo Galleano y Jos
Carlos Maritegui. Finalmente, con gran irona, presenta los diez libros ms
ledos por el "idiota" y una impresionante galera de medias verdades, por
la que desfilan frases de lo ms graneado de nuestras elites, incluidos
Mario Vargas Llosa y los tres mismos autores.
<dd>	En sntesis, se trata de un libro polmico fundamental para el liberalismo
finisecular en Iberoamrica que rescata, de la clsica idea del panfleto, la
indignacin y la irona como argumentos retricos de la libertad.&copy

<h2>
MALAS COPIAS DEL SISTEMA CHILENO DE PENSIONES
</h2>

Mary Anastasia O'Grady*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Cuando el "efecto tequila" hizo estragos en
Amrica Latina en 1995 y se retiraron capitales de la regin, Chile fue poco
afectado. Eso se debi en parte a su alta tasa de ahorro interno de
alrededor de 27% del PIB.
<dd>	En gran parte tan alta tasa de ahorro se debe a la reforma del sistema de
pensiones promulgado en 1980 e iniciado en 1981. Una vez que a los chilenos
se les dio el control sobre sus ahorros para el retiro, opciones sobre la
administracin e incentivos para retirarse del sistema pblico de pensiones,
la privatizacin tom vuelo. As comenz el auge del ahorro que hizo
prosperar el mercado local de capitales.
<dd>	La reforma del Seguro Social chileno tuvo tanto xito que las naciones
vecinas que sufren de bajas tasas de ahorro comenzaron a copirselo. Pero
por razones parroquianas el modelo chileno ha sido modificado en todas
partes, modificaciones que han debilitado los resultados. Aunque los
trabajadores de esos pases se han estado cambiando a sistemas de pensiones
privados, la conversin ha sido mucho ms lenta, lo cual ha conducido a los
crticos a sostener que el xito chileno se debe a la naturaleza nica de
Chile, su gente y su cultura poltica.
<dd>	Estn equivocados. La reforma funciona en todas partes y el modelo chileno
es transferible. Y ahora que las altas tasas de ahorro se han convertido en
el objetivo de los reformistas en todo el mundo, vale la pena comparar el
exitoso modelo chileno con las malas copias que han conducido a resultados
mediocres.
<dd>	El objetivo es, o debiera ser, dar las mejores pensiones al mayor nmero de
trabajadores, al menor costo posible. En Chile as se hizo al promover
cuentas individuales, cuyos beneficios reflejaran el esfuerzo individual en
ahorrar, al mismo tiempo que se promovi la competencia entre los
administradores privados de fondos. Un mercado competitivo impulsado por
ahorradores motivados gener buenos rendimientos.
<dd>	Al mismo tiempo, Chile tom los pasos necesarios para ir eliminando
paulatinamente el viejo sistema estatal de reparto, que es costoso,
ineficiente y est condenado a la insolvencia. Eso fue clave porque de otra
manera hubiera sido un freno al crecimiento econmico. Y ms importante an,
el gobierno adopt un nuevo lema: los incentivos funcionan.
<dd>	Desde 1981, todos los nuevos empleados en Chile optan por el sistema de
cuentas individuales bajo una administracin privada escogida por el
trabajador. Slo a los antiguos trabajadores se les permiti quedarse en el
sistema estatal, si as queran. El establecer una fecha de cierre para el
sistema estatal gener confianza en el nuevo sistema de capitalizacin.
<dd>	Durante la transicin a un sistema individual de capitalizacin, el
gobierno tuvo que buscar la forma de pagar obligaciones a los retirados a
medida que se reducan los ingresos del viejo sistema. Los jvenes ya no
estaban aportando las cuotas necesarias para pagar a los retirados ya que
ese dinero iba a sus cuentas individuales. El gobierno, entonces, emiti
Bonos de Reconocimiento a aquellos que ya haban contribuido, definiendo el
monto de las acreencias oficiales.
<dd>	A los trabajadores que se cambiaron para el sistema privado se les ofreci
una rebaja en la contribucin mandatoria y por ley todo el beneficio de este
recorte fue a parar a los trabajadores. Impuestos a la nmina para cubrir
pensiones, invalidez y salud que alcanzaban entre 30% y 35% en el viejo
sistema se redujeron a alrededor de 20%. Los trabajadores que se cambiaron
vieron de inmediato aumentar sus ingresos.
<dd>	Por el contrario, en Per, Colombia y la Argentina se ignor la
contradiccin que significa continuar paralelamente con el viejo sistema
estatal, dejando escoger a los trabajadores entre los dos. Algunos de los
nuevos que ingresan al mercado de trabajo optan por el sistema estatal
quebrado bajo la vieja creencia que el gobierno conseguir los fondos.
<dd>	Esos gobiernos continan drenando recursos del sector privado para
subsidiar un sistema estatal ineficiente. En la provincia de Buenos Aires
esto se hace al recolectar un impuesto a los empleadores de 12,6% para el
sistema estatal. Al mismo tiempo los empleados en el sistema privado aportan
obligatoriamente 11% para su propia pensin y pagan un impuesto de 3% que va
al sistema estatal. El resultado es una deduccin por nmina de 26,6% slo
para pensiones. Acabar con el sistema pblico sera lgicamente lo mejor.
<dd>	Originalmente el sistema peruano ofreca dos opciones desiguales. El
sistema estatal requera contribuciones de 9% del salario, 3% aportado
directamente por el trabajador y 6% por su empleador, mientras que a los
trabajadores que optaban por el sistema privado tenan que sacar de su
bolsillo 14%. Exactamente lo opuesto a lo que se haba hecho en Chile, donde
los trabajadores recibieron incentivos para cambiarse. No sorprende que
muchos peruanos dudaron cambiarse. Posteriormente Per igual las
retenciones y desde entonces no sorprende que el nmero de los que se
cambian al sistema privado ha crecido dramticamente.
<dd>	Otro error inicial en Per es el mismo cometido en Colombia, donde se le
permite a los trabajadores cambiarse de uno a otro sistema. Eso socava la
confianza en el sistema privado y retarda el crecimiento de la industria de
administracin de fondos de pensiones.
<dd>	Pero el gobierno colombiano fue an ms lejos al hacer publicidad por
televisin diciendo que el sistema privado no era confiable. En Chile, por
el contrario, el gobierno instrument una campaa de mercadeo para educar a
la gente sobre la privatizacin.
<dd>	Hoy el gobierno argentino opera su propia empresa de administracin de
fondos en competencia con el sector privado y garantiza un rendimiento. Como
en el gobierno no es necesario generar utilidades, puede subsidiar su propia
ineficiencia, gozando de injusta ventaja. A pesar de ello, el rendimiento de
la administracin gubernamental ha sido pobre y los ahorradores ms
experimentados escogen entre los administradores privados.
<dd>	El sistema chileno funcion porque sus diseadores crearon un mercado
competitivo. Para lograrlo tuvieron que limitar el papel del estado e
hicieron nfasis en la necesaria relacin entre esfuerzo y recompensa. La
gente tiende ahorrar si es motivada a hacerlo. Los chilenos, igual que el
resto de la gente, responde a los incentivos.&copy

<H2>TERRORISMO FISCAL CONTRA PRENSA MEXICANA</H2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El PRI, partido en el poder en Mxico desde hace
67 aos, est incrementando la represin sobre la sociedad para no perder el
control en las elecciones federales de 1997 y una de las armas que utiliza
son los fiscales del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
El prximo ao estarn en juego diputaciones, senaduras y gobernaciones en
diversas provincias. Existe el riesgo de que por primera vez en la historia
Mxico tenga un Congreso de oposicin, en manos del PAN, partido
conservador, lo que implicara cierto control sobre el ejercicio del poder
presidencial, hasta ahora casi absoluto. Muchos analistas polticos dan como
un hecho que la poblacin, descontenta por la crisis, ejercer el "voto de
castigo" contra el PRI.
<P>
Mientras tanto, el ministerio de Hacienda afirma que la evasin alcanza
niveles histricos y que este ao slo lograr recaudar en el impuesto al
consumo (IVA) $7.000 millones, comparado con $9.200 del ao pasado. Se trata
de una reduccin de 24%, motivada por el desempleo, las quiebras
empresariales y el deterioro del poder adquisitivo. El gobierno tendr, por
primera vez en siete aos, un dficit en el presupuesto para el prximo ao.
<P>
El PRI necesita dinero para cubrir el dficit fiscal y para ganar las
elecciones, a la vez que busca maneras de reprimir las crticas de sus
opositores. Por ello se comienzan a aplicar las viejas tcticas contra los
medios de comunicacin, para que estos no alienten el descontento popular y
deterioren la imagen del partido de cara a las elecciones. En el pasado se
les cortaba el suministro de papel a los peridicos crticos; ahora se
utiliza el terrorismo fiscal.
<P>
El lema de los terroristas en Europa es "mata a uno y atemorizars a diez
millones". El lema del Fisco en Mxico parece ser "encarcela a uno y
atemorizars a los otros". El ministerio de Hacienda ha desatado una campaa
de persecucin en contra de lderes empresariales, triplicando los
procedimientos por evasin.  El ms reciente alcanz a Juan Francisco Ealy
Ortiz, presidente y director de El Universal, el diario ms viejo de la
capital, de amplia circulacin nacional y que se ha distinguido
recientemente por mantener una lnea editorial crtica del gobierno de
Ernesto Zedillo.
<P>
Las autoridades acusan a Ealy Ortiz de evasin dolosa por $5,5 millones, de
presentar datos falsos, pagos no efectuados, declaracin de ingresos menor a
la real y cuentas bancarias que no "engranaban" en su contabilidad.
<P>
"Al seor Ealy no se le persigue por lo que dice ni por lo que escribe. Se
le persigue por lo que nos debe. No se le persigue como periodista. Se le
persigue como empresario evasor", afirma Toms Ruiz, subsecretario de
ingresos de Hacienda. Los enemigos de Ealy Ortiz aseguran que siempre fue
adulador de presidentes y beneficiario de gobiernos anteriores. Sin embargo,
para amplios sectores de la opinin pblica, se trata de un acto
autoritario, llevado a cabo con el propsito de sofocar las crticas.
<P>
Los dirigentes empresariales ms importantes del pas condenaron la orden
de aprehensin girada en contra del director de El Universal y protestaron
que fuese tratado como delincuente. El intento de captura se realiz con
lujo de prepotencia, por medio centenar de agentes judiciales que se
presentaron con armas de alto poder. "Ni siquiera en contra de
narcotraficantes despliegan esa fuerza... los contribuyentes son tratados
por el fisco peor que narcotraficantes...", coment un analista. Hacienda
dio amplia difusin y publicidad al asunto, como para que sirviera de
escarmiento general.
<P>
Los abogados defensores afirman que el gobierno ignor olmpicamente un
acuerdo de reestructuracin de adeudos fiscales que Ealy Ortiz haba firmado
meses atrs con el Fisco, lo que demostrara la arbitrariedad de los
funcionarios.
<P>
El presidente Zedillo, en su segundo informe de gobierno del 1 de
septiembre, dijo que sera aplicada "toda la fuerza del Estado" en contra de
los grupos guerrilleros. Pero lo que nunca se imaginaron los ciudadanos es
que "la fuerza del Estado" tambin sera aplicada en contra del sector
productivo. Y mucho menos que empresarios y periodistas seran tratados como
criminales y delincuentes. La pregunta en todas las mentes es quin ser el
prximo?

<title>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES
</h2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los escndalos de corrupcin, trfico de
influencias y favoritismo durante el sexenio del presidente Carlos Salinas
de Gortari han desprestigiado en Mxico lo que, en esencia, es un proceso
necesario tanto para equilibrar el presupuesto del gobierno como para elevar
la eficiencia de la economa. Las empresas estatales suelen ser monopolios y
sin competencia no hay eficiencia en la utilizacin de recursos escasos, por
lo que es necesaria su privatizacin.
<P>
Los idelogos de izquierda, enemigos de todo aquello que huela a libertad
econmica y gobierno limitado, han sabido aprovechar la situacin para
confundir a la opinin pblica y tratar de detener las reformas. Identificar
al mercantilismo como una consecuencia inevitable de la privatizacin es la
bandera enarbolada por muchos polticos pristas y lderes sindicales que
ven en las privatizaciones, la competencia y el libre mercado una amenaza a
sus intereses y privilegios.
<p>
En Mxico hoy todo es culpa del "neoliberalismo": la marginacin, la
pobreza, el desempleo, la destruccin ecolgica, la delincuencia. "Esta
forma de conducir el debate... es sumamente inconveniente e indebida... es
caer en una especie de oscurantismo; en la Edad media todos los males que
impedan el avance se los atribuan al Diablo y decan que por el Diablo
estaban mal las cosas... todo lo malo era culpa del Diablo; no se explicaban
en trminos de la falta de trabajo, de la falta de iniciativa, de la
prohibicin que haba para explotar las ideas... quienes etiquetan un
conjunto de polticas por medio de un calificativo como el de "neoliberal",
cometen el mismo error", dijo el presidente Ernesto Zedillo en una entrevista.
<p>
La verdad es que apartando la retrica demaggica, la venta de empresas
estatales es el mecanismo idneo para transformar ramas enteras de actividad
y mejorar la situacin econmica de familias y trabajadores. As lo
comprueba la privatizacin de la industria siderrgica mexicana. A partir de
su venta al sector privado en 1991, el desempeo de la industria mejor
notablemente.
<p>
"La reorganizacin administrativa de las empresas acereras, la
modernizacin de sus plantas, la reduccin de los problemas laborales, el
aumento de las exportaciones y los montos de inversin realizados en los
ltimos aos, ejemplifican cmo una industria que en algn momento se
consider vieja, de bajo rendimiento y condenada a un deterioro permanente,
puede desarrollar un gran potencial a partir del esfuerzo de sus
propietarios y trabajadores, en un ambiente de intensa competencia local y
con el resto del mundo", afirma un estudio del CEESP.
<p>
Como casi todas las reas industriales que permanecen por largo tiempo en
manos del gobierno, la industria siderrgica fue dejada prcticamente en
ruinas. A pesar de que las siderrgicas oficiales reciban grandes
subsidios, crditos "blandos", fuertes descuentos en la compra de materias
primas, proteccin frente a competidores extranjeros, tanto los ndices de
productividad como los mrgenes de utilidad eran muy bajos, los conflictos
laborales iban en aumento y la calidad del producto dejaba mucho que desear.
<p>
Los sntomas eran los mismos sufridos por todas las paraestatales:
tecnologa obsoleta,  la falta de mantenimiento aumentaba el nmero de
accidentes y reduca la produccin. Haba una plantilla laboral excesiva: la
industria siderrgica paraestatal empleaba a 40 mil obreros para producir
7,5 millones de toneladas de acero, lo que daba una relacin de 190
toneladas por ao/hombre, contra 270 toneladas en Estados Unidos,  459
toneladas en Japn y 677 toneladas en Corea del Sur. La poltica de control
de precios aplicada por las autoridades descapitaliz a la industria y el
gobierno tuvo que declarar en quiebra a Fundidora Monterrey, una de las ms
importantes.
<p>
Para ser rescatada, se requera invertir $2,500 millones y en agosto de
1990 fue anunciada su privatizacin. A diferencia de lo que ocurri en otros
casos, el gobierno no busc obtener el precio mximo garantizndole conceder
un monopolio a un selecto grupo de inversionistas privilegiados sino que se
preocup realmente por modernizar la industria. Las empresas siderrgicas
fueron vendidas en poco ms de $1.500 millones, cantidad muy inferior a su
valor contable. Como no hubo componendas ni compromisos de tipo poltico, el
gobierno abri fronteras a la competencia extranjera, derribando aranceles y
dems protecciones. A casi seis aos, la transformacin ha sido total.
<p>
Las siderrgicas privadas mexicanas invirtieron ms de $3.000 millones en
modernizar sus plantas; al mismo tiempo que redujeron su personal a la mitad
-a 20 mil trabajadores-, duplicaron sus ndices de productividad, lo cual
les permiti formar importantes alianzas estratgicas con empresas
transnacionales en materia comercial y tecnolgica. En medio de la crisis
ms grave de los ltimos 64 aos, las maquiladoras y la industria
siderrgica fueron las nicas que mostraron crecimiento. En cuestin de
calidad, las empresas han obtenido la certificacin ISO-9000, lo que les
abri mercados en 40 pases de los cinco continentes.
<p>
As pues, tras la retrica antiprivatizadora no hay ms que una profunda
confusin e incapacidad en reconocer el verdadero origen del mercantilismo,
la corrupcin, el monopolio y el fraude. Esos males no son productos del
libre mercado sino del estatismo y del exceso de poder que concentran
funcionarios y polticos.

<h2>
RESULTADOS DE LA AYUDA EXTERNA
</h2>
Steve H. Hanke*
<p>
BALTIMORE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente francs, Jacques Chirac, ha debido
considerar inhspito a Washington, cuando recientemente se dirigi a una
sesin conjunta del Congreso. Pocos senadores y representantes hicieron acto
de presencia, enviando ms bien a sus asistentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aparentemente ignorando el desaire, Chirac procedi a aleccionar al
auditorio sobre las equivocaciones de la poltica exterior de Estados
Unidos. Trat de colocar una pesada culpa sobre nuestros hombros por no
gastar ms en ayuda externa: "No abandonemos a su suerte a los pases ms
pobres de la tierra, especialmente a los pases del Africa. No los dejemos
en el crculo vicioso de la exclusin, permitiendo se agoten las fuentes de
asistencia oficial, ayuda que es indispensable para que avancen hacia la
democracia y el desarrollo".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese argumento ha sido utilizado por los franceses y otros europeos por
aos. Desde la Sptima Sesin especial de las Naciones Unidas en 1975, los
europeos han adoptado el objetivo de la ONU, en cuanto a que las naciones
desarrolladas deben transferir 0,7% de su PIB a los pases en desarrollo. En
conjunto, los pases industrializados derraman ms de $50.000 millones al
ao sobre las naciones pobres. Tales transferencias corresponden a ms o
menos 9% del PIB de esas naciones subdesarrolladas. Dinamarca, Noruega,
Suecia y Holanda sobrepasan la norma de la ONU y Francia casi si la alcanza.
Estados Unidos es el rezagado, al tranferir algo ms del 0,1% de su PIB,
convirtindose en blanco seguro de los fanticos de la ayuda externa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lo que hace ridcula esta situacin es que ninguno de los donantes se ha
molestado en averiguar si su generosidad logra algn bien. Por el contrario,
los benefactores se han opuesto abiertamente a todo anlisis econmico
objetivo sobre la ayuda externa, mientras apoyan los rebuznos de acadmicos
que predican gastadas frases sobre el tema.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Un destacado crtico que no ha sido silenciado es lord Peter Bauer del
London School of Economics. Por dcadas las investigaciones de P.T. Bauer
han revelado con detalle el dao infligido por la ayuda externa. El ao
pasado se le uni otro economista del London School of Economics, Peter
Boone, quien public un esplndido anlisis cuantitativo sobre la
efectividad de la ayuda externa para la Oficina Nacional de Investigaciones
Econmicas. Boone hace picadillo del sermn de Chirac.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Utilizando estadsticas de 97 pases receptores de ayuda exterior, Boone
concluye:
<p> No existe relacin alguna entre los niveles de ayuda y las tasas de
crecimiento de los pases receptores, implicando que falta de capital no es
una causa fundamental de pobreza.
<p> La ayuda externa no tiene impacto alguno en reducir las tasas de impuestos
o eliminando otras polticas distorsionantes que retrasan el crecimiento en
las naciones pobres.
<p> La ayuda externa logra un impacto insignificante en mejorar las mediciones
bsicas de desarrollo humano, tales como la mortalidad infantil y el
porcentaje de nios en las escuelas.
<p> La ayuda externa es muy efectiva aumentando el tamao del gobierno y
llenndole los bolsillos a las elites de los pases receptores. 75% de la
ayuda externa se utiliza para aumentar los gastos gubernamentales, lo cual
aumenta el clientelismo y el poder de funcionarios y polticos. La situacin
de la gente pasa a depender de la poltica gubernamental y de decisiones
oficiales. Esto distrae la energa empresarial de sus actividades privadas
para concentrarlas en la obtencin de favores, privilegios y corrupcin.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quizs porque tambin son polticos, pocos dirigentes de los pases ricos
se han dado cuenta que la ayuda externa hace ms dao que bien. A la fecha
slo un lder ha captado el efecto corrosivo de la ayuda externa y ha tenido
el coraje de denunciarla. Vclav Klaus, primer ministro de la Repblica
Checa dijo: "No slo nos ufanamos de poderlo lograr nosotros mismos, sino
que estamos profundamente convencidos que tal ayuda es negativa y
contraproducente". Esa actitud ayuda a comprender porqu ese es el pas
excomunista ms exitoso.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hasta Francia se est viendo obligada a reducir su ayuda externa para
ceirse a los criterios del Tratado de Maastricht. Eso ser bueno para
Francia y mejor para los pases que estn siendo corrompidos por la ayuda
francesa.&copy; <p>

<H2>Hora de decidir sobre la ONU.
</H2>
Jesse Helms*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En 
base a sus actuales operaciones, la Organizacin de
las Naciones Unidas no merece el apoyo americano. Su burocracia prolifera,
sus costos se disparan, su misin est en permanente expansin y muy por
encima de su capacidad. Peor todava, con la constante ampliacin de sus
actividades, la ONU est siendo transformada de una institucin compuesta
por estados soberanos en una entidad cuasi-soberana. Esa transformacin es
una amenaza a los intereses nacionales y est siendo financiada
principalmente por los contribuyentes de este pas, quienes aportan ms de
$3.500 millones al ao, convirtindonos en el ms generoso benefactor de
esta organizacin sedienta de poder.
<P>
 La situacin es insostenible. La ONU tiene que ser totalmente reformada.
Sin embargo, el secretario general Boutros Boutros-Ghali ha ignorado las
mltiples advertencias, protegiendo su inflada burocracia e insistiendo en
la creacin de un ejrcito propio de las Naciones Unidas y el poder de
recolectar impuestos directamente. Del empeo reformista de su prximo
secretario general depender la supervivencia de la ONU.
 <P>
La ONU fue creada para ayudar a facilitar soluciones pacficas de disputas
internacionales. Pero la lite internacional que maneja la ONU desprecia la
nocin de intereses parroquiales, cuando lo que importa es el inters
mundial. Esa manera de pensar se ajusta al movimiento en favor de una mayor
centralizacin del poder poltico en manos de una lite, a costa de los
individuos y sus representantes locales. Slo ahora se comienza a comprender
el efecto destructivo de las burocracias centralizadas y del control estatal
de las actividades econmicas. Vemos que una vez establecidas, las
burocracias junto con las ddivas que reparten son casi imposibles de
desmantelar.
<P>
 A medida que nos acercamos al nuevo  milenio, el virus de la centralizacin
se extiende a nivel global y la ONU es el portador. Se trata de impedir que
una burocracia que no ha sido electa por nadie siga aumentando su poder a
costa de lderes nacionales electos democrticamente. 
 Cun grande es el problema? Segn los ltimos datos oficiales, la ONU
emplea a 53.744 burcratas. Segn esta inmensa burocracia, no existe
problema internacional, nacional ni local que no sea problema de la ONU. Ah
tenemos la reciente conferencia Habitat II en Estambul, donde la ONU gast
millones de dlares para tratar los problemas de las ciudades, asuntos que
legtimamente deben ser manejados por los gobiernos locales.
<P>
 No slo se trata de que la ONU no debe estar metiendo las narices en todo,
sino que al hacerlo empeora la situacin. En lugar de ayudar a las naciones
a que encaren sus problemas, la ONU hace lo opuesto al crear desincentivos.
Cuando todo problema local y regional se convierte en uno mundial, nadie es
responsable. Al ser la responsabilidad de todos se convierte en la
responsabilidad de nadie.
<P>
La guerra en Bosnia es el ejemplo perfecto. Confrontar el genocidio y la
agresin de Serbia era una responsabilidad europea y de Estados Unidos. Pero
la administracin Clinton y sus aliados europeos pasaron la responsabilidad
a la ONU, la cual acept una misin imposible de cumplir. Las operaciones de
paz de la ONU fueron la excusa para la inaccin, por lo que murieron decenas
de miles de civiles inocentes, mientras la ONU con una combinacin de
impotencia y negligencia no hizo nada para detener el genocidio.
<P> 
La ONU tiende a complicar todo dando excusas para que intervengan naciones
sin inters en determinados problemas. Qu tienen que ver Togo, Zaire,
Panam, Irlanda y China con la paz en el Medio Oriente? Lo que la ONU logra
es darle cabida a muchos pases que nada  contribuyen a las discusiones.
Haciendo de cada asunto un problema mundial, la ONU intenta crear un mundo
que no existe. Vale la pena preservar una ONU consciente de sus
limitaciones, pero una ONU que insista en imponer a naciones soberanas su
visin utpica est pidiendo que la desmantelen.
<P>
 La reforma necesaria incluye reemplazar al secretario general por otro que
comience desde el primer da reduciendo la burocracia, limitando las
misiones y redefiniendo objetivos. Se requiere un recorte de no menos del
50% de la burocracia. Mientras esta permanezca seguir encontrando misiones
para justificar su existencia. Y hay que acabar con conferencias y comits
innecesarios.
<P>
 Por ejemplo, el gran logro del Comit para el Uso Pacfico del Espacio fue
aprobar la resolucin por la cual los estados miembros reportaran todos los
contactos con seres extraterrestres directamente al secretario general.
Adems de masivas y derrochadoras conferencias, como la de Beijing sobre las
mujeres, la ONU est todo el tiempo patrocinando reuniones y paneles de
discusin, 7.000 de estos en Ginebra el ao pasado.
<P> 
Tambin hay que revisar a fondo el presupuesto. El presupuesto que maneja
el secretario general hay que reducirlo de $1.000 millones a $250 millones.
As cada programa tendra que pasar el examen del mercado, al valorar cada
nacin los programas en que participar, diciendo cunto est dispuesta a
pagar. Continuaran los programas vitales, mientras desaparecen aquellos
favorecidos slo por la burocracia interna.
<P>
 El negocio de la paz es el que ms ha crecido, de $230 millones en 1988 a
$3.600 millones en 1996. Ahora "mantener la paz" tiene mltiples
significados, desde instrumentar elecciones y alimentar a los hambrientos
hasta construir naciones.
<P>
 Lleg la hora para un ultimtum de Estados Unidos: o se reforma rpida y
dramticamente a la ONU o nos retiramos. Sin esta amenaza, nada suceder.
Retener parte de las contribuciones no ha funcionado. No podemos llegar al
ao 2000 con la estructura actual. Claro que la ONU se opondr, lo mismo que
muchas de las naciones menos desarrolladas que se benefician del sistema
actual y ganan influencia vendiendo su soberana a la organizacin. Por
ello, la responsabilidad del prximo secretario general ser inmensa. Se
trata de una tarea gigantesca, pero de no lograrse, no vale la pena salvar a
la ONU y yo, entonces, estara a la cabeza del ataque para que Estados
Unidos se retire.

<h2>
EL BANCO MUNDIAL: 50 AOS DE FRACASOS
</h2>

Bryan T. Johnson*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente Clinton recomienda que Estados Unidos
aporte ms dinero a instituciones como el Banco Mundial y su administracin
se comprometi a dar $800 millones a la Agencia para el Desarrollo
Internacional, una de las subsidiarias del Banco. Eso es $100 millones ms
que en el ltimo presupuesto. Darle ms dinero al Banco Mundial es ignorar
la abrumadora evidencia de que sus programas han hecho muy poco en promover
el crecimiento econmico de las naciones menos desarrolladas. Es ms, ignora
las lecciones econmicas sobre las verdaderas causas del desarrollo.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin en 1944, el Banco Mundial ha participado en unas 165
naciones, argumentando que los pases menos desarrollados tienen pocas
posibilidades de prosperar sin substanciales prstamos subsidiados
provenientes del mundo desarrollado. Adems, considera estar en una posicin
nica para enfrentar ese reto, por lo cual debe continuar transfiriendo
capital a las naciones pobres.
<dd>	El Banco Mundial est simplemente equivocado. Las estadsticas muestran que
los ms viejos receptores de dinero del Banco Mundial no estn hoy en
mejores condiciones que cuando recibieron el primer prstamo y muchos estn
peor. 	Aquellas naciones que han salido del subdesarrollo durante los
ltimos 30 aos lo lograron liberando las fuerzas productivas en sus
economas. Los mejores ejemplos son Hong Kong y Singapur.
<dd>	Hoy el Banco Mundial tiene 178 miembros; slo 12 pases no son miembros.
Los aportes de los miembros dependen del tamao de sus economas. Estados
Unidos ha sido el mayor contribuyente, habiendo aportado $53.000 millones
desde 1944. 
<dd>	El propsito original del Banco fue prestar a las naciones desbastadas por
la Segunda Guerra para que reconstruyeran sus infraestructuras. Los bancos
privados no hacan estos prstamos por ser demasiado arriesgados y porque
muchas de esas naciones haban incumplido sus obligaciones despus de la
Primera Guerra. Pero mientras el Banco Mundial prest $543 millones a
naciones de Europa Occidental entre 1945 y 1950, las inversiones privadas de
Estados Unidos alcanzaron $1.760 millones durante el mismo perodo. 
<dd>	Para 1950 era obvio que el Banco Mundial haba servido su propsito y para
mediados de los 60 comenz a transformarse en una agencia de beneficencia
internacional. El cerebro de esta transformacin fue el ex Secretario de
Defensa estadounidense Robert McNamara, bajo quien se formul el concepto de
"desarrollo sostenible". Resumidamente eso significa que los pases menos
desarrollados pueden obtener niveles de desarrollo sostenible slo si
suficientes recursos son transferidos de los pases ricos a los pobres. El
Banco Mundial contina totalmente identificado con esa manera de pensar.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin el Banco ha provisto ms de $356.000 millones,
principalmente a naciones pobres. De 66 naciones menos desarrolladas que han
recibido fondos del Banco durante ms de 25 aos, 37 no estn hoy en mejor
situacin y 20 estn peor. De esas 20, las economas de ocho se han
contrado en 20% o ms.
<dd>	Entre 1965 y 1995, Nicaragua recibi $637 millones de ayuda del Banco
Mundial. En esos 30 aos el ingreso per capita de los nicaragenses se
redujo de $1.752 al ao a $875. Niger recibi del Banco ms de $589 millones
entre 1965 y 1995, mientras que el ingreso per capita de esa nacin africana
cay de $605 a $280. Despus de tres dcadas es evidente que los receptores
de ayuda a largo plazo no alcanzan un "desarrollo sostenible".
<dd>	La principal razn del estancamiento en esas naciones es falta de libertad
econmica y la mayora de los prstamos del Banco van a pases sin libertad
econmica. De los 18 pases receptores de fondos del Banco cuyas economas
han retrocedido 16 son economas "no libres" o "reprimidas" segn el Indice
1996 de Libertad Econmica y se caracterizan por altos impuestos, barreras a
las importaciones, restricciones a las inversiones extranjeras, onerosas
regulaciones, controles de precio y de salarios, infames polticas
monetarias e inmensos mercados negros.
<dd>	Es obvio que el enfoque del Banco Mundial ha fracasado y el retiro del
apoyo de Estados Unidos no slo ahorrara miles de millones a los
contribuyentes sino que le dara la oportunidad a naciones del mundo menos
desarrollado a romper las cadenas que los han mantenido empobrecidos.&copy

INDICE DE LIBERTAD ECONOMICA

<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Hasta Estados Unidos podra aprender de Chile. De hecho,
varios distinguidos economistas estadounidenses estn actualmente estudiando
la manera cmo Chile privatiz su sistema nacional de pensiones. Con el
Seguro Social en este pas deslizndose hacia la insolvencia, podramos
aprender de Chile la mejor manera de proteger a las personas retiradas.
<P>
 Aunque Chile no goza actualmente de una economa idealmente libre (a escala
mundial ocupa el rango 22 entre los 150 pases evaluados), s tiene la
economa ms libre de Amrica Latina. Si incluimos a las naciones del
Caribe, Bahamas est por delante de Chile, en el puesto nmero 9, a nivel
mundial.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, el hemisferio tambin cuenta con tres de las economas ms
reprimidas del mundo: Cuba, en el puesto 148, adems de Surinam y Hait,
empatados en el puesto 133.
<P>
 Esta evaluacin y jerarqua provienen del "Indice de Libertad Econmica
1997", editado conjuntamente por Heritage Foundation y The Wall Street
Journal, libro a publicarse el 16 de diciembre. All Hong Kong sigue
ocupando el primer puesto, como la economa ms libre del mundo. Este
volumen de 520 pginas presenta estadsticas comparativas sobre el nivel de
libertad econmica en 150 naciones.
<P>
 El Indice muestra a otros 13 pases de Amrica Latina y el Caribe con
economas bsicamente libres: Panam (31), El Salvador empatado con Trinidad
y Tobago en el puesto 34, Jamaica (36), Argentina (42), Belice y Uruguay
empatados en el puesto 43, Paraguay (46), Costa Rica empatado con Guatemala
y Barbados en el puesto 50, Bolivia (59) y Per (64).
<P>
 Los pases sin libertad econmica en el hemisferio incluyen al Ecuador
(75), Colombia (78), Honduras (84), Brasil y Mxico empatados en el puesto
94, la Repblica Dominicana (100), Guyana (104) y, a la cola, Nicaragua y
Venezuela en la posicin 108.
<P>
 En cada pas se analizan diez factores determinantes: si tienen una
poltica de intercambio comercial abierta o restrictiva, las tasas del
impuesto personal y empresarial, el grado de intervencin gubernamental en
la economa, si goza de una moneda estable, el grado en que motiva o
desalienta la inversin extranjera, si los salarios y precios son libremente
determinados por el mercado o fijados por el gobierno, cun efectivamente se
protegen los derechos de propiedad, el volumen de regulacin estatal y el
tamao de la economa informal. A cada pas se le asigna una nota en cada
una de estas 10 reas, del uno (mejor) al cinco (peor). Luego se saca un
promedio de estas notas y al pas se le asigna su posicin segn el promedio
obtenido.
<P>
 Adems de presentar un informe anual sobre el grado de libertad econmica,
este libro de Heritage y The Wall Street Journal  explica porqu unos pases
prosperan y otros retroceden. Las naciones econmicamente ms libres son
tambin las ms ricas, con el mayor ingreso per capita.
<P>
Por qu es esta una informacin importante? Tomemos el caso de Bangladesh,
en el puesto 118, un poco peor que Venezuela y Nicaragua. Si Bangladesh
contina con sus actuales polticas econmicas le tomar 102 aos alcanzar
el actual nivel de vida de Estados Unidos y de Europa occidental. Por el
contrario, si Bangladesh aplica polticas similares a Chile, obteniendo un
crecimiento de 6% anual, su gente alcanzara el nivel de vida de Estados
Unidos en 40 aos. La clave es la libertad econmica.
<P>
 Aunque la liberacin econmica no puede transformar a una nacin de la
noche al da, varios pases de nuestro hemisferio estn avanzando por ese
camino: Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Per, Barbados y Jamaica han seguido
progresando sucesivamente en las tres ediciones anuales del Indice. Por el
contrario, Venezuela y Colombia han retrocedido durante el mismo tiempo.
<P>
 El clima, la cultura, la educacin, la geografa, la infraestructura, la
fertilidad de sus tierras, sus riquezas naturales y la innovacin
tecnolgica contribuyen al xito econmico de un pas, pero ninguna nacin,
a largo plazo, tiene xito sin libertad econmica. Esto lo han demostrado
Chile y los "tigres" del Asia (Hong Kong, Singapur, Corea del Sur y Taiwan).
Amrica Latina est cada da ms consciente de ello.

PEMEX EMPOBRECE A MEXICO
</H2>
Isaac Katz*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO 
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
(AIPE).- Gracias a Pemex, el monopolio petrolero estatal,
los mexicanos somos y seremos ms pobres. Los accidentes mortales ocurridos
en las instalaciones de Pemex en Pltano, Cacao, Cactus, Guadalajara, San
Juan Ixhuatepec, etc. son eventos que nos han empobrecido y cuya factura
vamos a pagar todos los mexicanos con un menor ingreso presente y futuro. La
ineptitud con la cual se ha manejado esta empresa a lo largo de los aos,
las prebendas de que gozan los empleados sindicalizados, la corrupcin que
tradicionalmente ha imperado en los contratos de adquisicin de insumos, la
venta de plazas laborales y todos los dems adornos que caracterizan a
Pemex, implican un aprovechamiento muy ineficiente de la riqueza petrolera
mexicana y por lo mismo una generacin de ingresos derivados de la misma muy
inferior al potencial.
<P>
Los diferentes accidentes que recientemente han ocurrido en las
instalaciones de Pemex reflejan, en ltima instancia, la falta de definicin
de los derechos de propiedad que caracterizan a cualquier empresa del
gobierno y que por lo mismo se traducen en una administracin y operacin
ineficiente, cuyo costo todos pagamos. Entre las muchas campaas
publicitarias de Pemex, tratando intilmente de mejorar su deteriorada
imagen, haba una que afirmaba que "Pemex es de todos los mexicanos". 
<P>
Nada
ms falso. Pemex no es de todos los mexicanos, sino solamente de algunos,
particularmente del sindicato petrolero, que con todas las prebendas que
tienen en su contrato colectivo de trabajo obtienen un ingreso superior al
valor de su productividad. Por lo mismo, si el gobierno quisiera que Pemex
fuese de todos los mexicanos, tendra que volver a expropiar el petrleo,
pero esta vez quitndoselo al sindicato y privatizndolo mediante una oferta
pblica de acciones en la cual todos los mexicanos puedan participar.
El gobierno y la propia administracin de Pemex han sealado que no se
cuentan con los recursos requeridos para la modernizacin y ampliacin de
las plantas petroqumicas de la empresa paraestatal, por lo que propusieron
la venta del 49% de las acciones de las plantas. Si antes se perciba como
poco probable que este mecanismo indujera al sector privado a asociarse con
Pemex, sobretodo por la obsolescencia de las plantas y la presencia del
propio sindicato, despus del ltimo accidente, que muestra las
ineficiencias internas y el lamentable estado de la empresa, la
probabilidad de participacin privada es todava menor. 
<P>
Se sigue insistiendo que Pemex es y seguir siendo una empresa del estado.
Para muchos, ser propietarios de chatarra nos hace ser ms soberanos. Por la
forma en que hemos manejado nuestra inmensa riqueza petrolera, los mexicanos
somos ms pobres y tambin lo sern nuestros hijos.

<h2>
EL CAPITALISMO CHECO
</h2>
Vclav Klaus*
<p>
WASHINGON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.-  En 1996, por sexto ao consecutivo, en la Repblica
Checa tenemos un presupuesto equilibrado, lo cual es un logro importante. Y
eso no se trata de inventos econmicos sofisticados sino de la habilidad de
los lderes polticos en decir que no a gastos excesivos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Han pasado casi seis aos desde que colaps el comunismo y estamos entrando
a una nueva era que llamamos postransformacin. Ya las medidas
gubernamentales importantes para la transformacin se tomaron. No prevemos
implementar nuevas medidas extraordinarias. Como suelo decir, la ciruga
termin y estamos en la sala de recuperacin. Los retos que ahora
enfrentamos y las obras por realizar son ms normales, lo que significa que
los libros de texto de economa elemental son de mayor utilidad ahora para
nosotros que hace cinco o seis aos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comenzamos todo el proceso de transformacin con una clara visin de adonde
queramos ir, basado en los principios de "laissez faire", una economa de
mercado sin adjetivos calificativos, propiedad privada, gobierno pequeo, un
estado de derecho, libertad y responsabilidad individual.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Una clara visin es absolutamente crucial, pero no es suficiente. Hay que
contar con una estrategia para instrumentar esa visin. Y no me refiero a
planes constructivistas porque sabemos que no es posible promover la mano
invisible del mercado con la mano visible de polticos o intelectuales
omnipotentes. Sabamos que tenamos que desregular, liberalizar y privatizar
en cada etapa del proceso de transformacin, an ante la realidad de un
mercado dbil y por lo tanto ineficiente. Por ello nuestra estrategia fue
flexible y pragmtica. Se trataba de un proceso evolutivo, del comunismo a
la sociedad libre, que no poda ser dictado desde arriba.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conceptualmente era simple. Hace algunos aos se hablaba de la economa de
la transformacin, pero eso es un disparate. Es suficiente aplicar la
economa, la sociologa y las ciencias polticas normales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La privatizacin fue crucial y comenzamos de cero. Me daba risa cuando
algn banquero occidental me deca de la importancia de privatizar el
correo. Mi respuesta era que primero tenamos que privatizar las bodegas de
comestibles, al peluquero, al cafetn y al taller mecnico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las diferencias con las privatizaciones en Inglaterra son notables. All
privatizaban tres o cuatro empresas cada ao, mientras que nosotros
privatizbamos tres o cuatro empresas cada hora. Y ahora hemos alcanzado la
posicin en donde podemos discutir si vamos a privatizar 100% los
ferrocarriles o slo parcialmente.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En cualquiera de las etapas, la nica manera de proceder es a travs de la
economa de libre mercado, con propiedad privada y precios que reflejen
libremente el valor real de las cosas. Esa es la nica manera de preservar
la humanidad y el medio ambiente. Sabemos que el mayor peligro para el medio
ambiente es la liquidacin de la propiedad privada y el rechazo de los
precios libres, como fuente de informacin para saber sobre la escasez
relativa de los diferentes recursos. Los mayores crmenes contra el medio
ambiente han ocurrido en pases donde no hay propiedad privada, mercados ni
precios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nuestra misin ahora es defender la libertad econmica, evitando la
reaparicin del dirigismo, de intervenciones gubernamentales restrictivas e
improductivas, que ahora se presentan bajo nuevas banderas, pero que son tan
dainas como en el pasado. El peligro yace en la introduccin de nuevas
polticas basadas en los intereses de grupos de presin, en la ideologa del
corporativismo y el sindicalismo, en falsas teoras de justicia social, en
el ecologismo agresivo, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las ltimas cifras del crecimiento de la produccin industrial checa es de
21%, de la construccin 19%, mientras que el desempleo es de 2,8% y aunque
la tasa de inflacin sigue siendo exagerada - 8% -, somos el pas
excomunista con la ms baja inflacin.

Queremos seguir abriendo nuestro pas en todos los campos. En diciembre
fuimos aceptados en la OCDE, el llamado club de los pases ricos, el primer
pas excomunista que se hace miembro. Hace poco eso era apenas un sueo para
mi. Y tenemos la intencin de ser tambin miembros de la OTAN y del proceso
integracionista europeo, a pesar de las objeciones que tenemos sobre la
excesiva regulacin y control ejercido desde Bruselas. Sin embargo, queremos
ser miembros porque estamos empeados en convertirnos en una nacin europea
normal.&copy; <p>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PENSIONADOS POR MELANCOLIA
</h2>
Martin Krause*
<p>
BUENOS AIRES <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- 	Hay descubrimientos  que nos llenan de estupor o
asombro, otros no causan la menor sorpresa. En esta ltima categora se
encuentran los recientes anuncios acerca de la situacin del sistema
jubilatorio estatal argentino. 	
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Afectado por un enorme deficit que lo lleva a mostrar sus cuentas en rojo en
forma permanente, el gobierno decidi contratar a un reconocido
administrador de uno de los grupos empresariales ms importantes del pas
para que evaluara la gestin del sistema y presentara recomendaciones. Ahora
este experto ha dado a conocer su informe en el cual incluye, entre otras
cosas, las siguientes joyas burocrticas:
<p> Cinco personas, en la ciudad de La Plata, fueron jubiladas por estar
afectadas de melancola. 
<p> Hay 28.000 jubilaciones de fallecidos que se siguen pagando. 
<p> Supuestamente hay unos 4.500 ancianos de ms de 100 aos de edad cobrando
sus beneficios previsionales, cuya existencia no ha sido constatada por nadie. 
<p> Hay expedientes de jubilados con domicilios en lugares inexistentes; por
ejemplo, en el cruce de dos calles de la ciudad de Buenos que son paralelas.
<p> La Administracin Nacional de la Seguridad Social (Anses)  tiene 15
edificios en Buenos Aires destinados al archivo de expedientes. 
<p> Todava hay regmenes jubilatorios especiales que cubren a "enlazadores de
perros" y "conductores de perreras" que se retiran a los 55 aos, igual que
los zapateros y las bailarinas del Teatro Coln que son jubilados a los 40
aos de edad, mientras que para el resto de los ciudadanos se aplica el
mnimo de 65 aos. 
<p> Los abogados de Anses no se molestan en presentarse en las audiencias
judiciales u olvidan citaciones, con lo cual no es de extraar que la
institucin suele perder todos los juicios.
<p> Hay 138.056 demandas pendientes en los tribunales por ms de $ 2.400
millones de dlares. 
<p> Se han descubierto jubilaciones otorgadas a personas con apenas 3 o 5 aos
de aportes.
<p> En Tucumn lograron su jubilacin 30 personas presentando el mismo
electrocardiograma.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La razn de todo esto no es que los funcionarios pblicos son ms flojos o
ms brutos que el resto de la humanidad, sino que no tienen ningn incentivo
para llevar a cabo una eficiente administracin de lo recursos. Todos sus
incentivos apuntan hacia no hacer olas, mantener el cargo, ganar puntos con
sus superiores polticos y acumular poder a travs de mayores presupuestos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sin embargo, Argentina ha realizado una reforma del sistema previsional en
la cual se ha creado un nuevo rgimen paralelo y privado de capitalizacin
individual, el cual se desenvuelve con notable xito. Pero a diferencia de
la reforma implementada en Chile, aqu se mantiene el sistema estatal de
reparto como jubilacin mnima, en vez de eliminarlo con el transcurso del
tiempo como estn haciendo los chilenos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mantener  paralelamente el viejo sistema politizado significa mantener
todos los incentivos para que las situaciones ahora denunciadas sigan
generndose. Podr realizarse una limpieza, reformular la estructura,
modificar los procedimientos, pero seguir siendo manejado por gente cuya
eficiencia no es premiada ni su ineficiencia castigada, como sucede en el
sector privado, a travs del simple y claro mecanismo de las ganancias y las
prdidas. Los millones que se gastarn en la reorganizacin del sistema
seran mejor invertidos en su eliminacin total.

<TITLE>Leon: Un Encuentro de Perfectos Idiotas -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>UN ENCUENTRO DE PERFECTOS IDIOTAS</H2>
Roberto Salinas Len*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El encuentro organizado por los zapatistas de
Chiapas contra el "neoliberalismo" es una dramtica demostracin del
subdesarrollado pensamiento que motiv la reciente publicacin del libro
"Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano". Todos los males del orbe se le
atribuyen al "neoliberalismo": el narcotrfico, la pobreza, la marginalidad,
la tirana del dinero, la cartera vencida, la iniquidad fiscal, el
imperialismo cultural Slo se les olvid sealar la impotencia sexual, el
malestar estomacal y la derrota de Mxico por Nigeria.
<dd>	
Una linda causa, oponerse a un fantasma como el "neoliberalismo", descrito
con esa belleza sentimental que caracteriza la retrica del que sabe mucho
de nada, experto en conceptos indefinidos, literatos como Carlos Monsivais
que afirma: "el neoliberalismo, una de las realidades mas oprobiosas del
planeta". 
<dd>	
Fue un encuentro de perfectos idiotas latinoamericanos. Son tres las
caractersticas que  los definen y las tres se ponen de manifiesto en las
declaraciones del encuentro. La primera caracterstica es el
"antigringuismo". Se insiste que Estados Unidos es la fuente de los males de
la regin, desde el mbito comercial hasta el poltico. En Mxico, la
perspectiva del idiota antiliberal impide aprovechar uno de los recursos mas
valiosos del pas: nuestra vasta frontera de 3,000 kilmetros con el mercado
ms grande del mundo. El sentimentalismo nacionalista de  los sermones
contra el neoliberalismo no borran el hecho que la gran mayora de las
exportaciones mexicanas disfrutan del inmenso mercado vecino ni que gran
parte del capital extranjero que necesitamos puede obtenerse en los mercados
financieros al norte de la frontera.
<dd>	
Estados Unidos es un mercado privilegiado, aun con disposiciones tan
nocivas como sus leyes de proteccionismo subrepticio. Nos conviene
aprovechar la geografa con apertura comercial e instrumentar una poltica
sensata de inversin extranjera. No aprovecharlo, acusando a los vecinos del
norte de causar todos nuestros problemas es una verdadera marca de idiotez.
<dd>	
Una segunda caracterstica del idiota antiliberal es su fatalismo; la idea
que los problemas de Mxico son producto de fuerzas exgenas, que el destino
nos ha dictado el subdesarrollo. En  ocasiones se cita la cada de los
precios del petrleo y el peso de la deuda externa; en otras, la
globalizacin financiera, los capitales especulativos, hasta la propia
existencia de mercados financieros. Mxico es un pas joven, cuyos actores
son parte de una generacin devaluada por la cultura antiprogreso. En los
ltimos 25 aos, la economa mexicana ha sufrido mayores desequilibrios
socioeconmicos que en los 150 aos anteriores, aun cuando ocupamos una de
las regiones mejor dotadas en el mundo.
<dd>	
Es curioso que el idiota antiliberal nunca se pregunta por qu pases como
Singapur y Taiwan, sin riquezas naturales, han logrado alcanzar el nivel de
vida de los ingleses y, por el contrario, por qu Mxico, Venezuela y
Brasil, teniendo de todo sufren de tanta pobreza. La razn es la debilidad y
la politizacin de nuestras instituciones. 
<dd>	
Un pas donde se respetan instituciones como el derecho de propiedad y los
contratos, sin permisos ni favoritismo poltico, acumula mayor inversin en
capital humano y as genera  riqueza. Se trata de crear incentivos y
confianza. La postura fcil siempre es culpar al otro, sin reconocer los
errores que tanto le han costado a nuestra devaluada generacin.
<dd>	
La tercera caracterstica del idiota antiliberal, de aquel que todas las
noches antes de dormir hace grgaras con lo "social", es la teora del
pastelito: la idea que la riqueza es un factor preestablecido y lo que se
necesita son buenos planificadores que la distribuyan justamente, como si se
tratara de las porciones de un pastel. A ello se aade tratar de solucionar
la pobreza a travs de una poltica fiscal: ms y ms gasto, sin importar
sus nefastas consecuencias. La distribucin "equitativa" de la riqueza que
propone el idiota latinoamericano implica una injusta transferencia de
recursos del sector productivo al sector burocrtico, generando rentismo e
imposibilitando la formacin de capital, con lo cual ms bien se logra una
masiva distribucin de la pobreza.
<dd>	
El encuentro zapatista en Chiapas fue un encuentro de envidia, la
caracterstica ms perniciosa del idiota latinoamericano. Segn el
periodista e historiador ingls Paul Johnson, la envidia "es la mas
peligrosa de todas las emociones populares el Estado todopoderoso es fuente
de muchos males; pero sobre todo es el mejor custodio de la envidia".

<TITLE>Salinas-Leon: MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO-- 9/04/96</TITLE>

<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO</H2>
Roberto Salinas-Len*<br>
<p>



CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- El llamado del presidente Zedillo a un debate
sobre la poltica econmica ha generado gran polmica sobre si se debe
cambiar el modelo y en cuanto a la participacin del Estado. Hay tres
aspectos del debate que son fundamentales: el crecimiento, la poltica
monetaria y la estructura institucional de la economa. 
No hay inconsistencia entre el llamado a debatir la poltica econmica y las
declaraciones presidenciales de que "no habr cambio en el modelo". Zedillo
tiene toda la razn; no puede haber un retorno al estatismo y al
proteccionismo, por ms que decirlo ofenda sensibilidades de aquellos que
persisten bajo la ilusin que el intervencionismo del Estado es la solucin
a los problemas de Mxico.<p>
	El hecho que la liberalizacin sea el nico camino viable no implica que no
haya elementos de estrategia econmica abiertos a debate. No es el fondo (el
qu), sino la forma (el cmo) lo que se pretende debatir.<p>
	La primera dimensin del debate, el crecimiento, es un caso dramtico por
las grandes diferencias que persisten en cuanto a poltica econmica. Por un
lado se discute si la economa va bien o mal, a la vez de cmo acelerar el
crecimiento vis-a-vis el proceso de abatir la inflacin. Por otro lado, se
contemplan los mecanismos radicales necesarios para lograr un alto
crecimiento de la economa. El gobierno mexicano plantea una tasa de
crecimiento anual de 5%; y si bien tal nivel es apenas suficiente para
generar los empleos que la fuerza laboral requiere, es ciertamente
insuficiente para superar el subdesarrollo. Por lo tanto, el debate debe
contemplar estrategias que permitan alcanzar un crecimiento sostenido de 8%
anual, congruente con la estabilidad de precios.<p>
	Sin embargo, entre los protagonistas de la poltica econmica se escuchan
diferentes versiones. El Banco de Mxico mantiene que la prioridad es bajar
la inflacin, mientras que otros, por la desesperacin de lograr la
reactivacin de la planta productiva, afirman que el crecimiento debe ser la
meta principal del gobierno. Muchos interpretan esa disyuntiva como una
lucha entre los obsesionados con la estabilidad de precios (inflacin baja,
a pesar de bajo crecimiento), y aquellos obsesionados con el crecimiento
(alto crecimiento, a pesar de alta inflacin). <p>
	Pero se trata de una disyuntiva falsa porque los objetivos se pueden
combinar. Tenemos que reducir la inflacin y simultneamente lograr un alto
crecimiento econmico. No se trata de abatir la inflacin a costa del
crecimiento y empleo ni de aumentar estos en perjuicio de la estabilidad de
precios. Hay que aumentar el nivel de vida y ello requiere alto crecimiento,
sano y sostenido.<p>
	La segunda dimensin del debate, la poltica monetaria, surge de la
necesidad de preservar el valor de la moneda. De lo contrario no hay ahorro.
Nos hemos comprometido en un sistema de flotacin, pero no se ha definido la
ruta cambiaria.<p>
	La tercera dimensin del debate es la estructura de incentivos a adoptarse
en la economa. Nuestro subdesarrollo es en gran medida por la ausencia de
un sistema de derechos de propiedad bien definidos. No contamos con
instituciones imparciales que aseguren el cumplimiento de contratos,
derechos de propiedad confiables o que nos permitan derivar todos los
beneficios del intercambio de bienes, debido a los altos costos de
transaccin impuestos por un exagerado intervencionismo del Estado en la
actividad econmica.<p> 
      	En los ltimos 15 aos, la economa mexicana ha crecido al raqutico
promedio anual de 1,9%. Y el nivel de vida ha cado dramticamente, ya que
se trata de un perodo donde aumentos bruscos de la inflacin fueron la
regla, no la excepcin. La explicacin fundamental de este escenario de
"estanflacion" (inflacin combinada con recesin) son nuestras muy poco
confiables instituciones y las psimas polticas econmicas. Por todo ello,
es importante abrir el debate sobre  los detalles de la poltica econmica
nacional. <p>

<h2>
DEFENSA DE LA LEY HELMS-BURTON
</h2>     
     
     

Alvaro Vargas Llosa*
<p>


MADRID <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Durante una reciente gira por varios pases latinoamericanos
para presentar un libro que acabo de perpetrar con Carlos Alberto Montaner y
Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza -"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano"- me han
preguntado hasta la saciedad: quin es el ms idiota de todos?  Siempre
contest que los idiotas son muchos pero que, con toda justicia
entomolgica, debe sealarse contemporneamente a Fidel Castro como la reina
de la especie. Y aad que son idiotas quienes creen que el problema
principal de Cuba es el embargo estadounidense, que su levantamiento
precipitara la cada de Castro y que la "ley Helms-Burton" es una
conspiracin contra la soberana de Canad, Mxico, Espaa, Francia, Japn o
la Cochinchina.
<dd>	Se ha desatado en Espaa una fuerte campaa contra la "ley Helms-Burton" de
una inequvoca ndole nacionalista. Detrs de todos los argumentos respira
el orgullo espaol herido por una legislacin norteamericana supuestamente
imperialista. Un anlisis puramente legal bastara para demostrar que lo
nico que ha hecho Estados Unidos es ejercer su derecho como pas. La ley no
dice que se va a penalizar a quienes inviertan en Cuba sino a quienes
trafiquen con propiedades que fueron de norteamericanos y dejaron de serlo
por un acto, no de derecho, sino de fuerza. Quienes no trafiquen con estas
propiedades pueden seguir comerciando con Cuba, del mismo modo que Cuba
puede seguir montando empresas en el exterior para burlar el embargo, como
lo hizo durante tantos aos desde su famoso Departamento MC que acab en el
juicio estaliniano contra el general Ochoa, De la Guardia y compaa. Como
le dijo recientemente el canciller argentino Di Tella al canciller cubano,
Cuba puede comerciar todo lo que quiera con el mundo, siempre que pague.
<dd>	Pero no es ste argumento legal -basado en que Estados Unidos tiene derecho
a proteger a sus ciudadanos, ejerciendo as la funcin esencial que tiene el
Estado- el que quiero traer a colacin. En Espaa, las razones para apoyar
la ley son ms poderosas que en todos los otros pases del planeta. Se
invoca en estos das, con las venas del cuello hinchadas, los derechos de
las pocas decenas de empresarios espaoles que han decidido -con poco
sentido de sus propios intereses- hacer negocios en la Cuba de hoy. Por qu
tendran estos intereses que ser ms importantes, a la hora de juzgar la ley
Helms-Burton, que los de las decenas de miles de comerciantes espaoles
cuyas propiedades y negocios fueron confiscados por Castro.  El comercio
minorista estaba prcticamente en manos de espaoles en la Cuba de fines de
los 50 y unos 30 mil espaoles expropiados por Castro nunca fueron
compensados por aquel acto de brutalidad.
<dd>	Pero hay ms: si escarbamos un poco en la historia cubana de este siglo
llegaremos a la conclusin de que un porcentaje elevadsimo de la poblacin
es espaola. Entre la poblacin cubana blanca (40% del total), quienes no
tienen ascendencia espaola inmediata son una minora. En 1902 un censo
estableci que la mitad del milln trescientos mil habitantes eran espaoles
(incluyendo, para desgracia de Amrica, a un tal Angel Castro). En los aos
siguientes llegaron a Cuba ochocientos mil nuevos inmigrantes espaoles,
entre asturianos, gallegos y canarios, que inclinaron decisivamente la
balanza demogrfica hacia el lado espaol. Y no era una inmigracin hija o
nieta de espaoles, era espaola y punto. De esa inmigracin son hija y
nieta directas las dos generaciones que hoy constituyen el universo de
vctimas de la dictadura castrista y est en marcha una tercera.
<dd>	Si es vlida la premisa de Palmerston de que la poltica exterior de un
pas debe ser defender los interese de sus ciudadanos, quin puede afirmar
que Espaa debe oponerse a la ley Helms-Burton?
<dd>	Pero hay an ms: est entre los intereses de Espaa, tambin, defender la
democracia en los pases latinoamericanos. Esto significa, en trminos
prcticos, penalizar a las dictaduras. Todava est muy lejos del continente
americano la conciencia de que la libertad es indivisible, que no se puede
separar la libertad poltica de la libertad econmica. Aunque hay muchos
ejemplos americanos de libertad a medias, ningn caso ha contribuido ms a
la confusin ideolgica y moral que el caso cubano. El ltimo episodio de la
larga batalla de Castro en favor de la confusin es la "opcin china": el
intento de crear unos espacios de capitalismo dentro de estructuras de poder
comunistas o simplemente despticos. La piedra de toque de esa operacin es
la inversin extranjera. Se vende la idea de que Cuba al menos va hacia la
libertad econmica, lo que engendrar la libertad poltica. Que este
razonamiento es farisaico lo demuestra el hecho de que Yugoslavia, que tuvo
relaciones econmicas privilegiadas con las democracias desarrolladas,
sigui siendo una dictadura comunista hasta los acontecimientos
cataclsmicos que todos conocemos, y el hecho de que Ceausescu, a quien fue
concedido el trato preferencial por Estados Unidos, se aferr al poder  en
Rumania por 24 aos.
<dd> Aunque es cierto que las sanciones econmicas no bastan para tumbar
gobiernos, no hay duda de que las inyecciones econmicas vitaminizan a las
dictaduras. Y aunque la Cuba de Castro no ofrece ninguna seguridad jurdica
a los inversionistas extranjeros, ni hay all las mnimas condiciones
econmicas para que los capitales hagan buen negocio, la existencia de estas
inversiones provee un sostn al rgimen de Castro y le facilita la siniestra
inculcacin del "sndrome de Estocolmo" entre sus vctimas, psicolgicamente
dependientes de la nica mano que les pone un mendrugo en la boca.
<dd>	Es una buena cosa que Jos Mara Aznar no se haya dejado acorralar por la
histeria antiyanqui durante la visita de Al Gore y que haya mantenido muy
claras las prioridades; incluso si se est formalmente obligado a oponerse a
la "ley Helms-Burton", no debe perderse nunca de vista que la batalla
principal en el caso cubano es contra la tirana y a favor de sus vctimas,
y que Estados Unidos -nico pas del mundo que intenta hacer algo concreto
contra Castro- no es responsable ni de que Cuba sea una inmensa fbrica de
sufrimiento ni de que 10 millones de cubanos no lleguen a producir la
tercera parte de los $30.000 millones que los exiliados cubanos producen
cada ao en el pas libre que les abri las puertas cuando todos los dems
se las cerraban.
<dd>	Desde agosto de 1994, cuando Castro lanz a 30.000 balseros contra las
costas de la Florida (y Washington desperdici la oportunidad de acabar de
una vez por todas con la dictadura), uno tena la impresin de que la nica
prioridad en la poltica exterior hacia Cuba era evitar nuevos inmigrantes.
Gracias a un error poltico monumental -el asesinato de los pilotos de
"Hermanos al Rescate"-, Castro precipit una saludable alteracin de las
prioridades en la poltica exterior norteamericana hacia Cuba. Mantengamos
esas prioridades donde deben estar. &copy;

<H2>LIBERALISMO</H2>
Franklin Lpez B.*<br>
<p>



NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- No cabe duda que el Estado intervencionista,
estabilizador, asistencialista, planificador e igualitario result ser un
fracaso. La cada del muro de Berln y el desmantelamiento de la Unin
Sovitica fueron manifestaciones fehacientes del desencanto de los pueblos
con el modelo estatista y socialista. Ese desencanto no se circunscribe a
los antiguos pases comunistas sino que se extiende a todos los confines de
la tierra.<p>
Pero las reformas poltico-econmicas que se han instrumentado en muchos
pases, aunque con diversos matices conceptuales, lamentablemente se han
aglutinado todas bajo la etiqueta de liberalismo o neoliberalismo.  As se
calific la poltica de Collor de Mello en Brasil, la de Carlos Andrs Prez
en Venezuela, la de Salinas de Gortari en Mxico, la de Fujimori en el Per
y la de Carlos Menem de Argentina. Si bien es cierto que algunas de esas
polticas tienen un corte liberal, no es menos cierto que la praxis
poltico-econmica de estos regmenes no goza de una cohesin conceptual
liberal autntica. Por eso, muchos no saben o confunden lo que es y lo que
propone el liberalismo.  <p>
     	Para algunos, la alternativa frente al fracaso del Estado
intervencionista es el caos, el desorden, la anarqua, la ley de la selva,
en otras palabras el "capitalismo salvaje" que supuestamente resultara de
la aplicacin del liberalismo manchesteriano o anarco-capitalista.  Nada ms
lejos de la realidad. El liberalismo es una doctrina de Estado, cuyo fin
primordial consiste en crear y defender un marco legal e institucional en el
cual florece la libertad individual. Carlos Alberto Montaner escribe: "El
liberalismo es un modo de entender la naturaleza humana y una propuesta para
conseguir que las personas alcancen el ms alto nivel de prosperidad
potencial que posean, dentro del mayor marco de libertad".<p>
     	El liberalismo busca una sociedad en la cual cada individuo tenga la
potestad de elegir los medios que ms le convengan para obtener sus propios
fines, sabiendo que tal esfuerzo conduce a mejorar las condiciones del resto
de la sociedad, siempre y cuando se respeten los derechos de terceros. El
economista espaol Pedro Schwartz afirma: "Nosotros [los liberales] no nos
ocupamos del individuo, que sabe lo que quiere, que lleva su propia vida la
mayor parte de las veces con buen seso; nos preocupamos del Estado, por las
razones de su existencia, por la necesidad de que funcione bien, por el
temor de que se desve de su tarea para convertirse en un mecanismo opresor".<p>
     	Frecuentemente, de buena o mala fe, se confunde al liberalismo con el
mercantilismo, donde los que gozan de poder econmico se asocian a quienes
ejercen el poder poltico para disfrutar de privilegios,  protecciones,
crditos blandos, monopolios y dems ventajas en perjuicio del bolsillo y de
la libertad de seleccin de los consumidores, es decir, del pueblo.
En cualquier caso, el libre mercado es slo un aspecto del pensamiento
liberal. El liberalismo implica libertad poltica y econmica, propiedad
privada e imperio de la ley, estabilidad fiscal y transparente
administracin de la justicia, moneda sana y orden pblico, defensa nacional
y libertad de comercio, tanto en el mbito nacional como internacional. Ser
liberal no es slo amar la libertad para tener la oportunidad de prosperar,
es ser tolerante de los gustos, flaquezas y prioridades de los dems,
defender el individualismo y propugnar la privatizacin de las empresas
pblicas. Es todo eso y mucho ms. Ser liberal es creer en los dems, en la
dignidad y diversidad del hombre.<p>
Estas condiciones no son producto del sentido comn ni son verdades
absolutas o evidentes. Son resultado de la discusin, del debate, de la
experiencia de otras naciones y del estudio. Ningn liberal argumenta ser
dueo de la verdad. Es posible acercarse a ella a travs de la duda,
buscando su confirmacin o su negacin en el quehacer humano y en la
experiencia de la vida diaria. Tal es la esencia del liberalismo verdadero. * <i><center>*Economista ecuatoriano, profesor de la Universidad de Nueva Orleans. </center><i><p>

BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO

November 14

<h2>
BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
</h2>
Franklin Lpez B.*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Se dice que Abdal Bucaram, el nuevo presidente del
Ecuador "tendr un xito absoluto o ser un fracaso rotundo". El problema de
la incertidumbre se basa ms en el fraccionamiento de las fuerzas polticas
ecuatorianas que en la inhabilidad del presidente en especificar un plan
coherente de trabajo. 
<p>
En primer lugar, el sistema poltico ecuatoriano est diseado para la
inercia. Los grupos dominantes tienen capturada a la dirigencia poltica y
civil de tal manera que es prcticamente imposible iniciar cambios
radicales. El Congreso ocupa su tiempo en discusiones intiles; cuando
logran reunir qurum inician juicios polticos con el nico objetivo de
empantanar la accin del Ejecutivo y si a eso sumamos las acciones
obstaculizadoras de un sector judicial politizado es fcil concluir que el
statu quo tiene todas las de ganar.  
<p>
                En segundo lugar, existe en el pas una enorme desconfianza
del "neoliberalismo".  Inclusive la Conferencia Episcopal se ha declarado en
contra del neoliberalismo "salvaje". Los sindicatos, los grupos indgenas,
la Unin Nacional de Educadores, las asociaciones estudiantiles
universitarias, los empleados del gobierno nacional, de las provincias y
municipios tienen un formidable poder de convocatoria; cuando perciben una
amenaza a sus intereses salen a las calles en manifestaciones violentas,
cierran carreteras, crean disturbios o se declaran en huelga, lo que en el
Ecuador significa la toma de las instalaciones y la interrupcin de las
labores ordinarias. Los dirigentes slo necesitan enarbolar la etiqueta
"neoliberalismo" para impedir cualquier cambio que no les convenga. 
Tercero, los partidos polticos, tanto de izquierda como de derecha,
realizan clculos polticos para el siguiente perodo. Cuentan con que el
gobierno de turno se desgaste y as poder llegar al poder.  An ms,
propician el descontento con quejas sobre las partidas presupuestarias o
sobre los nombramientos de gobernadores u otras autoridades y lo hacen desde
el Congreso o mediante paros de ciudades y pueblos. 
<p>
                Frente a esta realidad no es mucho lo pueda hacer un
presidente, inclusive uno con el temperamento de Bucaram.  Adems, Bucaram
se topa con elementos endgenos que van hacer su labor an ms difcil.
Entre sus opositores estn los que han llegado a sus actuales posiciones por
su afiliacin poltica, aquellos que no tienen otra ideologa que la de
disfrutar del cargo pblico, aquellos que creen que "hacer gobierno"
significa "hacer de las suyas", aquellos que dicen defender los intereses
del pueblo sin comprender el alcance de sus propuestas. Y de todos estos
est llena la administracin actual. 
<p>
                Otro elemento endgeno es el folklorismo ecuatoriano, de lo
cual no se escapa ni el mismo presidente: un da se cree Julio Iglesias,
otro da se corta el bigote en subasta, un da regala su salario a los
mendigos, otro da llama "burro" a un ex presidente y luego pide disculpas a
los burros. La caracterstica primordial de lo folklrico es el simbolismo;
es decir, es ms importante la forma que el fondo, valen ms las intenciones
que los resultados.  En lo folklrico dominan las imgenes y los espejos;
los mitos y los espejismos sustituyen a la realidad. Poco importan los
hechos, lo esencial son las emociones. El Ecuador es un pas folklrico por
antonomasia, por eso algunos comentaristas lo han llamado Absurdistn o pas
de Ripley. Un ejemplo basta: el ao pasado, una organizacin llamada Manos
Limpias decidi "limpiar" los tribunales, cmo?, pues con escobas y baldes
de agua. Lo importante, repito, es el simbolismo, las intenciones, "sentirse
bien".  Hoy el folklore ha llegado al poder con todo su colorido, pompa y
esplendor. 
<p>
                El tercer elemento endgeno es la tendencia al
autoritarismo. Se militarizan las aduanas, se cierran los locales que venden
licor, se aprehende a muchachos de pelo largo, se amenaza con la crcel a
los especuladores, se cancela sbitamente un contrato con una empresa de
petrleos; en definitiva, la tnica que va apareciendo es que el "que no
est conmigo est contra m".  Claro que esto es comprensible frente a los
factores antes mencionados, pero me temo que ms que ser producto de la
frustracin es el resultado de una tendencia natural del temperamento del
presidente hacia "hacer lo que le da la gana". 
<p>
  Pero no todo est perdido. Aunque en menor grado, hay factores de cambio
hacia un mundo mejor. Entre stos es importante la actitud de Bucaram hacia
la bsqueda de soluciones prcticas y sus sueos de reeleccin. Aunque no
tiene una ideologa definida, Bucaram es  sincero en su afn de lucha contra
lo que l percibe como "oligarquas", los grupos de poder que se amamantan
de la teta del estado. Intuye el problema sin comprenderlo en su totalidad y
por ello se ha rodeado de individuos que tienen un visin bastante liberal.
En lo econmico el ms conocido es Domingo Cavallo, pero tambin hay
asesores chilenos para reformar el seguro social, bolivianos para la
capitalizacin de las empresas estatales y as algunos cambios se  realizarn. 
En conclusin, la presidencia de Abdal Bucaram no ser ni de grandes
transformaciones ni de grandes desastres.

<title>Mellor: Nueva York Reprime la Iniciativa</title>

<h2>
NUEVA YORK REPRIME LA INICIATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Chip Mellor*
<p>

NUEVA YORK <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Esta ciudad se conoce mundialmente por su historia
empresarial y fue en gran parte creada por generaciones de inmigrantes. Las
nuevas corrientes migratorias provenientes del Caribe, Amrica Latina y
Europa oriental vigorizan los viejos barrios con su empuje e iniciativa.
Nueva York est siendo envuelta por una nueva ola de modestos inmigrantes
con iniciativa individual.
<dd>	Veamos algunos ejemplos de la investigacin hecha para el Instituto para la
Justicia por Howard Husock de la Escuela de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de
Harvard. En los barrios de Brooklyn y Queens, cientos de autobusetes -casi
todos manejados por inmigrantes del Caribe- trasladan pasajeros regularmente
hasta las estaciones del metro. El precio del pasaje es inferior al de los
autobuses pblicos  y, segn los usuarios, el servicio es mejor y ms confiable.
<dd>	En Harlem y otras barriadas negras surgen de la noche a la maana salones
de belleza que se especializan en peinados de mltiples y diminutas
trencillas. En las esquinas y lotes vacos de los barrios surgen
"pulgueros", ferias y mercados de vegetales, donde caribeos y africanos
venden toda clase de productos, desde franelas hasta libros, mientras otros
preparan alimentos de todas partes del mundo. Se estima que los vendedores
callejeros en Nueva York ya suman 25.000.
<dd>	En una ciudad donde el 10% de la poblacin vive de la beneficencia pblica
y decenas de miles estn presos por trfico de drogas, esta explosin de la
iniciativa individual es alentadora, pero las autoridades tratan de
aplastarla, hostigando y hasta arrestando a la gente por el "crimen" de
intentar ganarse la vida productivamente.
<dd>	Los conductores de los autobusetes informales no logran conseguir licencias
de la ciudad para operar y an cuando las obtienen son multados y hasta
confiscados por recoger pasajeros en una parada "oficial" de autobs. A las
peluqueras negras se les niega una licencia a menos que tomen mil horas de
clases de cosmetologa que para nada le sirven en su negocio. Al no tener el
permiso municipal, se les obliga a trabajar en la clandestinidad por el
pecado de ejercer una profesin que el gobierno se empea en regular.
<dd>	Los vendedores callejeros que aplican por un permiso pronto se dan cuenta
que las autoridades aprueban menos de una cuarta parte y se les dificulta
hasta conseguir una planilla de aplicacin. Y si los taxista "piratas" en
lugar de responder a llamadas  telefnicas recogen pasajeros en la calle o
de los aeropuertos tienen que adquirir un "medalln" que en el mercado
cambia de manos por $200.000, cantidad totalmente fuera del alcance de estos
nuevos empresarios que comienzan desde abajo.
<dd>	Las leyes, licencias, permisos y certificaciones ocupacionales cubren 73
pginas del Directorio Oficial de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Se requiere de
una licencia para reparar un videocasete, vender entradas para la lucha
libre, o establecer un estacionamiento.
<dd>	Aunque Nueva York es de lo peor, las manicuristas en Charlotte, los
taxistas en Boston y los vendedores callejeros en San Diego sufren de
similar acoso por parte de las autoridades municipales. El Instituto para la
Justicia adelanta la publicacin de investigaciones sobre las barreras
legales contra la libre iniciativa en Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Detroit,
Nueva York, San Antonio y San Diego. Estamos decididos a llevar adelante en
los tribunales y ante la opinin pblica una campaa para restaurar la total
proteccin constitucional a la libertad econmica. &copy

<h2>
MEXICO: CORRUPCION  DE LAS LEYES 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Agustn Navarro
</a>

<P>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (AIPE).- Se sabe que la corrupcin no es un fenmeno
exclusivamente mexicano, pero en los ltimos tiempos lo que aqu sucede ha
llamado la atencin de los medios de comunicacin de todo el mundo.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Siguiendo el "principio de la causalidad", es decir, respetando la
inexorable relacin entre "causa y efecto", descubrimos que esa corrupcin
es perfectamente consistente con la naturaleza de nuestro sistema poltico,
econmico y jurdico. En efecto, el origen -y por tanto la solucin- de la
corrupcin radica en buena parte en las normas vigentes (leyes, reglamentos,
decretos, etc.), que no slo produce, sino que estimula e inmuniza a la
expoliacin. Se trata del saqueo al amparo de la ley, frase descriptiva de
la corrupcin acuada en 1850 por Federico Bastiat en su magistral obra "La
Ley". Bastiat defini a la ley como "la organizacin colectiva del derecho
individual a defenderse". El punto de partida, por lo tanto, es que el
individuo requiere para su supervivencia preservar su persona, su libertad y
su propiedad, y que cada uno de estos requisitos bsicos son completamente
dependientes de los otros dos. De ah tambin se desprende que la sociedad
tiene el derecho de organizarse y crear una fuerza comn que proteja
permanentemente esos derechos. Por ello, el derecho colectivo -y su propia
legalidad- est basado en los derechos individuales. As como un individuo
no puede usar legalmente la fuerza contra la persona, libertad o propiedad
de otro individuo, la fuerza comn (la ley) no puede ser usada para destruir
la persona, libertad y propiedad de los individuos o grupos.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Bastiat mantena que cuando la ley no se autolimita y no se confina a sus
funciones propias, se pervierte y empieza a actuar en contra de su propsito
original. Al ser manipulada para destruir su objetivo fundamental, aniquila
la justicia que se supona deba mantener y destruye los derechos que deba
respetar, ponindose al servicio de gente sin escrpulos, que prcticamente
sin riesgos explotan a la persona, libertad y propiedad de otros,
convirtiendo la expoliacin, o sea a la corrupcin, en un derecho del
gobernante y de sus allegados. Es entonces cuando la ley manejada a su
antojo por el poder poltico logra su trnsito de corrupcin. As fue como
en Mxico y en otros pases se cre una estructura legal, buscando
garantizar derechos sociales y econmicos que exceden a los fundamentales
derechos individuales, que para ser satisfechos requieren del uso compulsivo
de la ley en transferir y redistribuir la riqueza. As se dise toda esta
ingeniera de pillaje y extorsin socioeconmica de impuestos, regulaciones,
protecciones, subsidios, licencias, permisos, concesiones, transferencias,
etc., plasmada por doquier en nuestra Constitucin y leyes secundarias. Por
el contrario, debiramos entender la ley,  igual que Bastiat, como un
concepto de naturaleza negativa. Esto es, el propsito de la ley es evitar
que reine la  injusticia. La verdadera justicia slo se alcanza mediante la
erradicacin de la injusticia. Cuando la ley impone por la fuerza una
restriccin al trabajo de los individuos o transfiere riqueza sin el acuerdo
o compensacin de los afectados, est actuando positivamente y la sociedad
entonces queda en manos del poltico de turno en el poder, abrindose las
puertas de par en par a la corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por ello, antes de crear una nueva legislacin ineficiente, dirigida
combatir la corrupcin, hay que revisar con honestidad y con precisin
jurdica todo ese cuerpo de leyes que han creado privilegios y de hecho han
concedido licencias para expoliar y saquear a los ciudadanos, bajo un
rgimen de impunidad. Las recientes y escandalosas revelaciones de
corrupcin son emanaciones de un pantano ya bien conocido por todos. Los
polticos y empresarios que han disfrutado por dcadas los rentables frutos
del "me das, te doy", saben perfectamente cmo manejar ese sistema de
infinita complejidad en que se ha constituido la manera de hacer negocios en
Mxico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Podrn rodar las cabezas de prominentes miembros de la lite
polticoempresarial del pas, segn la guillotina desafilada de nuestro
sistema de justicia, si as lo determinan nuestros jueces -lo que falta por
verse-, pero si no se atiende el verdadero origen del saqueo al amparo de la
ley, que permite lucrar desde los puestos pblicos mediante la manipulacin
de leyes y reglamentos, con decretos que crean regmenes de excepcin en
favor de un grupo o sector, con protecciones a la banca, industria y al
comercio, en perjuicio del libre ingreso de nuevos competidores al mercado,
la corrupcin no cesar y la misma sofisticacin de que ya goza el crimen
organizado har que retoe. Conclusin: La corrupcin, como las escaleras,
se barre de arriba hacia abajo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citemos finalmente a Montesquieu, quien en "El espritu de las leyes",
nos dice: "Hay dos gneros de corrupcin: una cuando el pueblo no observa
las leyes, y el otro cuando el pueblo es corrompido por las leyes, mal
incurable ya que radica en el nico remedio que el mal tendra".

<h2>
LA INEFICAZ ESTRATEGIA CONTRA LAS DROGAS 
</h2>     
     
     
Agustn Navarro*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En 1919 fue ratificada la enmienda 18 de la
Constitucin de Estados Unidos, conocida como la "Ley de la Prohibicin" de
licores. La aplicacin de esa ley fue desastrosa en trminos de corrupcin y
florecimiento del crimen organizado hasta su derogacin en 1933. Los
efectos antisociales que tuvo la prohibicin del licor se asemejan a los que
enfrentamos hoy con las drogas. Las autoridades internacionales, encabezadas
y presionadas por el gobierno de Estados Unidos, estn concentradas en su
prohibicin al costo que sea, tanto poltico, econmico o social. El
fundamento conceptual es que ciertas drogas  -arbitrariamente seleccionadas-
son ilegales y sujetas a una persecucin implacable.
<dd>	Se argumenta que las drogas son perjudiciales y por tanto se debe evitar su
uso. Fuera de la consideracin bsica sobre quin tiene derecho a
determinar coercitivamente qu debe o no autoadministrarse un mayor de
edad?, conviene distinguir entre el uso y el abuso. Hasta los alimentos
pueden ser muy perjudiciales si se abusa de ellos. Por tanto, el simple uso
no es una justificacin suficiente para considerar algo ilegal y prohibirlo. 
Para demostrar lo anterior y exponer el grave error conceptual comparo tres
alcaloides (drogas): la nicotina, la cafena y la cocana (dos legales y una
ilegal), que comprueba la arbitrariedad oficial en su clasificacin.
<dd>	La nicotina es un alcaloide lquido muy alcalino que se obtiene de las
hojas del tabaco y es una de las drogas ms txicas que existen. Acta con
una rapidez comparable a la del cianuro de potasio. La dosis letal de
nicotina es de alrededor de 60 mg. y dosis tan pequeas como 4 mg. pueden
producir sntomas alarmantes en individuos no habituados. A pesar de que un
cigarro puede contener hasta 30 mg., la inhalacin de nicotina no resulta
tan txica como se esperara y son las secuelas del tabaquismo las ms
dainas. La nicotina produce al principio efectos estimulantes (disminuye el
aletargamiento y la fatiga) y posteriormente deprime el sistema nervioso,
mediante bloqueo neuromuscular sobre el sistema cardiovascular y
respiratorio. Tiene efectos antidiurticos severos, induce la liberacin de
adrenalina, produciendo excitacin, temblores y convulsiones, hipertensin
arterial, taquicardia, vasoconstriccin y aumento del flujo coronario.
Incrementa la secrecin bronquial y salival. Produce diarrea, nusea y
vmito. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y tolerancia. 
<dd>	La cafena es un alcaloide soluble del grupo de las xantinas que se
encuentra en distintas variedades de los frutos y semillas de las plantas
del caf, t, cacao, mate y en refrescos de cola. Es un poderoso estimulante
del sistema nervioso central. Mejora la asociacin de ideas y el flujo en el
pensamiento. Es un estimulante vasomotor y un potente diurtico, que tambin
contrae al msculo cardiaco y relaja al msculo liso bronquial e intestinal.
En dosis altas de cafena predomina la vasodilatacin perifrica sobre la
vasoconstriccin coronaria y pulmonar. Sin embargo, disminuye el flujo
sanguneo cerebral por el aumento de la resistencia circulatoria. Tambin
acorta el tiempo de coagulacin. La dosis txica fatal humana es de 10 gr.
Sin embargo, los sntomas de toxicidad (insomnio, excitacin, inquietud,
trastornos sensoriales en odo y visin, tensin y temblores musculares,
taquicardia, palpitaciones y aumento en el ritmo respiratorio) ya se
presentan a partir de ingestiones de 1 gr. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y
tolerancia. El t negro tiene un 2% de cafena, una taza de caf tiene entre
100 a 150 mg. de cafena y en individuos no habituados una sola taza puede
producir efectos txicos. 
<dd>	La cocana es un alcaloide que se obtiene de las hojas de la coca, que
contienen entre un 0,6% a 1,8% de este anestsico local que bloquea la
conduccin nerviosa en donde se aplica y que tiene un importante efecto
colateral como estimulante del sistema nervioso central, produciendo
inquietud, excitabilidad y locuacidad. Aumenta la capacidad del trabajo
muscular, disminuyendo la fatiga y acelerando el ritmo respiratorio. A la
estimulacin central le sigue una depresin. Su uso frecuente crea hbito.
Produce taquicardia, vasoconstriccin, aumento de la temperatura, dilatacin
de la pupilas. Se absorbe en todos los sitios de aplicacin, incluso  en las
mucosas. Ingerida, la cocana se hidroliza y es inefectiva. Se destruye
(metaboliza) ms rpidamente que la mayora de los alcaloides. La dosis
fatal es de aproximadamente 1,2 gr. Sin embargo, en individuos no
habituados, dosis desde 20 mg. tienen efectos txicos.
<dd>	An sin entrar a comparar drogas como el alcohol y la marihuana, no son
vlidos los argumentos de toxicidad de unas sustancias o siquiera el de la
letalidad de las dosis para hacer ilegales a unas drogas (cocana) y a otras
no (nicotina y cafena). El abuso del alcohol (droga legal) est ms
asociado a criminalidad, accidentes, destruccin familiar y dao corporal
que consumir marihuana (droga ilegal). Toda esta ingeniera burocrtica
prohibicionista se ha hecho para sustentar ese fundamentalismo
anticientfico que prevalece en la legislacin antidrogas y continuar
justificando que las drogas son un problema legal y criminal, en vez de uno
de salud pblica, de medicina y educacin preventiva, formas mucho ms
adecuadas para disminuir su uso y especialmente su abuso.
<dd>	Se han llenado las crceles de todos nuestros pases de presos por "delitos
contra la salud" (en California ms del 85%) y Estados Unidos ya ha gastado
ms de $150,000 millones en esta guerra santa, pero el narcotrfico y la
corrupcin siguen aumentando. Parecera  que los zares antidrogas y los
nuevos Elliot Ness esperan que se contaminen las fuerzas armadas de nuestros
pases para intervenir en forma directa como ocurri en Panam y que
nuestros sistemas bancarios, financieros y empresariales se vean inundados y
controlados por el dinero lavado No es, acaso, la ayuda tecnolgica y
financiera antidrogas la nueva "zanahoria" y el nuevo "garrote" que
condicionan el otorgamiento unilateral de la "Certificacin"? 
<dd>	Hay muchas formas de lucrar con las drogas. El crimen organizado -tanto en
su versin gangsteril y violenta, como en la de traje y corbata- bien sabe
que las dificultades impuestas slo aumentan sus mrgenes de
comercializacin. Pero hay otros "sepulcros blanqueados" que tambin lucran
desde la burocracia, con un puritanismo anticientfico y un fundamentalismo
casi religioso, combatiendo a las drogas en forma tal que nunca se resuelva
el problema y si se empeora, mejor para sus intereses personales.  
<dd>	Utilizar con propsitos comparativos la nicotina y la cafena no insina su
criminalizacin, sino probar lo discrecional y arbitrario de la
clasificacin actual de las drogas. Uno de los grandes placeres de la vida
es tomarse un buen caf  y  fumarse un buen tabaco. &copy;

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA ETICA Y EL MERCADO</H2>
Agustn Navarro*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A menudo escuchamos crticas al mercado libre con
argumentos de que "la mano invisible" es impulsada por las ms bajas
pasiones de hombres perversos, sin freno tico ni humanitario en la
consecucin de sus aviesos fines de lucro. Tal crtica demuestra una
ignorancia monumental sobre la naturaleza del mercado, pero crea un ambiente
propicio para todo gnero de alternativas fantasiosas y dainas en
regularlo, restringirlo o impedir de plano su funcionamiento.
<dd>
El mercado es simplemente un proceso de intercambio de informacin basado en
los precios como sistema de sealizacin, los cuales concertan y armonizan
ofertas de productores con las demandas de consumidores de bienes y
servicios. En la medida que las seales de los precios sean libres, sin
controles o artificios, la informacin ser fiel y el mercado eficiente.
<dd>
Por tanto, al ser slo un proceso, el mercado es ticamente
neutro. No requiere ni de egosmo o maldad, como tampoco de altruismo y
caridad para funcionar. Lo que requiere la economa para funcionar no son
agentes ticamente calificados sino racionales. 
<dd>
El argumento central de la presunta inmoralidad del mercado
es la famosa "maximizacin de las ganancias" por parte de los participantes,
argumentando que no existira en un mundo ticamente perfecto, donde lo
importante es ayudar al prjimo,  concluyendo que el mercado est
fundamentado en una expoliacin utilitaria e inmoral. Sin embargo, la
realidad es que la maximizacin de las utilidades funciona tan bien en una
sociedad de santos como de diablos. La nica diferencia es que los santos
aplicarn las utilidades a elevados fines filantrpicos y los avaros las
usarn para fines de diversin materialista y egosta. La moralidad,
entonces, no radica en la obtencin de ganancias sino en su uso. Las
ganancias claramente no son el ltimo objetivo.
<dd>
No hay impedimento alguno para la plena convivencia del
mercado y la tica, bajo el funcionamiento del sistema de precios libres,
basado necesariamente en la maximizacin de las ganancias. Lo importante es
aclarar que el mercado es ticamente neutro, ya que promueve eficientemente
el logro de metas de todo tipo y, por tanto, es independiente de los
principios ticos o no de los actores que en l participan.
<dd>                
Al reconocer que en el libre mercado (capitalismo) pueden
coexistir individualidades y conductas inmorales con otras que no lo son
surge el requisito para su buen funcionamiento de un marco de derechos de
propiedad que elimine el dao social derivado de conductas repugnantes.
Cuando se respetan las reglas del sistema, los derechos de propiedad de la
mayora no podrn ser violados como resultado del comportamiento inmoral de
algunos. Por el contrario, el sistema de mercado libre asla y protege a los
participantes del perjuicio directo derivado de la conducta inmoral de algunos. 
<dd>                
No existe otro sistema socio-econmico que ofrezca esta
proteccin y garanta. Adems, el productivo y espontneo "contrato" social
que ofrece el mercado, basado en la divisin del trabajo, especializacin,
descubrimiento de oportunidades de servir a los consumidores y todo ese
proceso coordinado por el sistema de precios, permite que el nivel de vida
de la poblacin se vea beneficiado involuntariamente, an por aquellos que
actan inmoralmente.
<dd> 	
Baste decir que an los vicios privados pueden generar bienes pblicos.
Esto, claro est, no nos exonera de denunciar y repudiar los comportamientos
inmorales, como la corrupcin, el engao y la avaricia. Al final de cuentas
todos somos humanos imperfectos, pero tampoco podemos argumentar que el
mercado y la tica se oponen, o que la inmoralidad es un requisito para que
el mercado funcione. Ms bien, es en el mercado donde la tica tiene mayor
campo de accin y la inmoralidad es ms inofensiva, en razn directa a la
multitud de opciones que el mercado libre le ofrece a la sociedad.

INMIGRACION Y DROGAS: JUSTOS POR PECADORES
</H2>
Agustn Navarro*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La inmigracin en Estados Unidos sigue
experimentando enormes presiones polticas provenientes de posturas
aislacionistas y puritanas tanto de republicanos y demcratas como de la
bala perdida texana, Mr. Perot.  Esto ha provocado que paguen "justos por
pecadores" en lo que se antoja como un "Juicio Final" fronterizo de
indocumentados y en particular de residentes de origen mexicano.
<P>
                Por otra parte, existe gran preocupacin en Mxico respecto
a las reacciones del Congreso y del Ejecutivo de Estados Unidos, al usar
polticas financieras y comerciales hacia Mxico como medidas de presin
para forzar al gobierno mexicano a combatir el narcotrfico, sin ofrecer
acciones recprocas -en calidad y cantidad- por parte y dentro de Estados
Unidos.
<P>
                Desde la posicin norteamericana, el campo de batalla de las
drogas debe permanecer en territorio extranjero: Mxico, Colombia, etc. Los
narcticos -desde la perspectiva migratoria- es ahora el problema ms
preocupante que afecta el cruce ilegal. La contaminacin de la inmigracin
con drogas es extensa. Cada da ms y ms trabajadores indocumentados son
forzados por el crimen organizado de ambos lados de la frontera a llevar
drogas, lo cual ha sustituido las cuotas que antes se pagaban a los coyotes.
<P>
                La operacin de los "Carteles de Inmigracin" -homlogos de
los "Carteles de Drogas"- coordinados desde Centro y Sudamrica es un nuevo
y extremadamente virulento factor en el aumento de la criminalidad en las
ciudades fronterizas de Mxico. El dinero y las drogas involucradas en esta
extensa operacin estn corrompiendo a la polica, a los funcionarios
aduanales y a oficiales de migracin de ambos pases. Slo basta para
confirmar todo esto darle un vistazo a los testimonios que han salido a
relucir en el juicio del narcotraficante Garca Abrego.
<P>
                Un creciente nmero de otrora inocentes trabajadores
indocumentados estn siendo encarcelados en prisiones federales
estadounidenses y cumplen largas sentencias por delitos de narcotrfico.
Evidentemente, la inmigracin ya no es tan solo un problema interno del pas
recipiente.  No es materia slo de suprimir servicios pblicos a los
inmigrantes. No es cuestin de negar educacin, salud y asistencia a los
hijos de inmigrantes. Se ha convertido en tema de gran importancia en la
poltica local de ambas naciones. Es un problema que concierne a los
intereses de seguridad nacional tanto de Mxico como de Estados Unidos.
<P>
                El crimen organizado se meti en el nuevo negocio del
trfico de seres humanos y tiene que ser despojado de los incentivos que
ofrece el mercado de drogas ms grande del mundo.  Las drogas llegan a
Estados Unidos por invitacin (por la demanda interna), igual como los
trabajadores forneos.
<P>
	La respuesta efectiva a la inmigracin ilegal es una combinacin de mercados
ms libres y flujos legales de personas altamente motivadas. As se evitar
que nuestros trabajadores migratorios caigan en las manos del crimen
organizado, pagando justos por pecadores.
<P>
                Es evidente que la regulacin y los acuerdos internacionales
en materia de narcticos estn creando inmensos mercados y privilegios
monoplicos al crimen organizado. No hay nada ms daino y atentatorio a los
intereses nacionales que la contaminacin criminal de la que son vctimas
los esforzados compatriotas que van en busca de oportunidades que Mxico, su
patria, todava les niega.

<h2>
SUICIDIO ELECTORAL REPUBLICANO
</h2>
Grover G. Norquist*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Imagnese por un momento ser el candidato a la cabeza en
la carrera por la nominacin de su partido a la presidencia de Estados
Unidos. Entonces, un colega suyo, miembro de su propio partido, quien ha
anunciado su retiro del Congreso, introduce un proyecto legislativo que, sin
duda alguna, enemistar profundamente a 2,5 millones de votantes. Adems,
esa misma legislacin contiene aspectos extremadamente ofensivos para grupos
de fieles partidarios. Y, como si fuera poco, 1996 es el primer ao de
elecciones desde tiempos de Eisenhower en que su partido tiene la
oportunidad de alcanzar la Casa Blanca y mantener la mayora en el Congreso.
Pero, a la vez, necesita todo el apoyo posible para ganar la nominacin y
luego las elecciones nacionales. Por qu entonces permitirle a este colega
que ponga todo esto en peligro?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese es el dilema que enfrenta Bob Dole con su colega, el senador Alan
Simpson, quien ha introducido un proyecto legislativo sobre inmigracin que
es un desastre en potencia para el Partido Republicano. Permitir que se
discuta en el Congreso es una psima idea por multitud de razones.
Cualquiera que sea el resultado, se ofender a un grupo importante de
partidarios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El proyecto de Simpson le dice a 2,5 millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses
que se olviden de las peticiones para traer a sus familiares a este pas.
Toda esa gente que ha cumplido con las leyes y ha estado esperando hasta 10
aos veran que, gracias a los republicanos, el gobierno cambi las reglas.
Gran parte de estos 2,5 millones de votantes, quienes adems viven en los
estados con ms votos electorales (Nueva York, California, Illinois,
Florida, Massachusetts y Michigan), van a votar nicamente en razn de este
asunto en particular.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Visas para familiares no es un asunto que concierne a la gran mayora de
los votantes. Se trata de un escenario nico: si se aprueba la ley, los
republicanos perdern 2,5 millones de votos. Si no se aprueba, no perdern
ningn voto. Estn oyendo esto los candidatos republicanos?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este proyecto de ley contiene cosas aborrecidas por diferentes grupos de
republicanos. El Partido Republicano es el partido de quienes quieren bajar
impuestos, sin embargo esta ley le aumenta los impuestos a la clase media,
impone nuevos impuestos al cruzar la frontera y a las empresas que emplean
extranjeros. Tales aumentos se reflejarn en los precios que pagan los
consumidores.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adems, se planea darle a cada ciudadano estadounidense una tarjeta
nacional de identidad, con algn tipo de "identificador biomtrico", tales
como huellas digitales o registro de la retina que tendra que ser revisado
por los empleadores. Por primera vez, en la historia de este pas, nadie
podra conseguir empleo sin el visto bueno del gobierno federal. Todo
norteamericano que aprecie su libertad debe sentirse ofendido por tal
legislacin, especialmente aquellos grupos que sufren de persecucin oficial
y que tienden por ello a ser republicanos, como los dueos de armas y
quienes dan clases particulares a sus hijos por no gustarles las escuelas
pblicas. Segn el Servicio de Inmigracin (INS), la instrumentacin de una
tarjeta de identidad o registro nacional de trabajadores costara no menos
de $6.000 millones.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Y, sencillamente, no funcionar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quienes quieran contratar a indocumentados lo seguirn haciendo. Slo
servir para estorbar a los ciudadanos que legalmente buscan trabajo. El INS
calcula que alrededor de 27% de su documentacin est errada. Si
milagrosamente lograran que slo 2% de sus datos estuvieran equivocados, a
1,3 millones de estadounidenses se les negara arbitrariamente el empleo y
tendran que introducir peticiones al gobierno. Cualquiera que haya tenido
tratos con el gobierno federal sabe cunto tarda cualquier trmite y el
problema que ello representara para quien tiene que pagar la hipoteca y
alimentar a la familia.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lanzarse a una eleccin habiendo apoyado el proyecto de ley Simpson
equivaldra a que Bob Dole le pidiera a James McDougal (el socio de Clinton
en Whitewater) que le financiara la campaa presidencial.

<H2>EL DEPORTE COMO MAESTRO</H2>
Michael Novak*<br>
<p>



WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  No es fcil ser buena gente. Honestidad, lealtad,
auto-control, disciplina y consistencia son atributos que tienen que
aprenderse para tener una buena y exitosa vida. Son tambin las cosas que
distinguen a los buenos atletas. Por eso las historias de dedicacin al
trabajo, determinacin, saber aguantar derrotas y no perder la cabeza con el
xito son parte del buen camino.<p>
	Los atletas tienen que aprender a aceptar derrotas. Hay que aguantar el
calambre en la pierna y sobreponerse a las preocupaciones. El campen
triunfa sobre las presiones. De esa manera los deportes nos ensean a vivir.
Nos entrenan a cumplir con nuestras obligaciones y a obedecer rdenes. Pero
hay ms en la vida moral que eso y el deporte nos da la visin grande. El
deporte nos entrena a dominarnos. Aprendemos a fomentar nuestras habilidades
y a controlar nuestros hbitos, a darle la cara a retos difciles y a
convertirnos en mejores personas.<p>
	Lo esencial para convertirnos en personas morales es hacer el bien en forma
natural. Hacer las cosas bien, como parte de nuestra propia naturaleza. Eso
implica esfuerzo y dedicacin. A menudo se comienza cambiando nuestra
actitud y buscando motivacin. Uno debe querer cambiar y estar dispuesto a
trabajar por conseguir pequeas mejoras constantemente, a travs de mucho
tiempo.<p>
	En cierta forma, los deportes ensean mejor la moral que las leyes. Con
demarcaciones, las leyes definen lo que no se puede hacer y, en ciertas
ocasiones, tambin definen lo que s se puede hacer, al prescribir las
reglas. En el deporte tambin se tienen que aprender las reglas. Pero un
buen deportista tiene que ir mucho ms lejos, tiene que aadir fortaleza,
exactitud y gracia.<p>
	Y hay otros aspectos morales en el deporte. El deporte es esencialmente
competitivo y el deportista con suerte es el que se enfrenta a otros grandes
atletas que lo empujarn a alcanzar lo ms alto, de otra forma nunca
averiguara cun grande hubiera podido ser. Cuando no hay necesidad de
herosmo, no surgen hroes.<p>
	Algo parecido sucede en la vida moral. Hasta que no confrontamos un grave
problema no se prueban nuestras virtudes. Entonces es que nos enteramos de
lo que la fuerza moral significa y si la tenemos o no.<p>
	Las olimpadas nos recuerdan la tradicin moral del deporte. Los griegos no
las concibieron simplemente como un gran espectculo de entretenimiento.
Estaban ms bien calibrando virtudes, hbitos productivos, logros; eran ms
una exhibicin de la belleza del espritu humano que alguna distorsin
muscular del cuerpo. An hoy en da las olimpadas siguen siendo una
celebracin del espritu y de los valores clsicos.<p>
	Me pregunto qu haramos por la educacin moral de nuestros nios si no
existieran los deportes. En qu otra actividad los jvenes de hoy aprenden
a resistir el dolor y la derrota? Dnde ms se esfuerzan por alcanzar
perfeccin? Algunas veces se fajan a trabajar en sus estudios, pero a menudo
hacen el mnimo posible. Y en cuanto a las obligaciones y trabajos en la
casa, en la vida moderna no tienen la urgencia de antes y es realmente poco
lo que ayudan. Pero en los deportes aoran hacerlo bien. Es bello verlo.
Nunca vi a mis hijos con caras ms serias que cuando estaban compitiendo en
algn deporte.<p>
	Vale la pena tomar el deporte en serio. Cualquier labor que busca alcanzar
la excelencia ofrece un estupendo objetivo. No es fcil mantener presentes
las lecciones aprendidas en el deporte durante el resto de nuestras vidas,
pero cunto ms pobres seramos si no tuviramos al deporte como maestro. <p>

<h2>
UNA AGENDA PARA DESTRUIR A VENEZUELA
</h2>     
     
     
Jorge Olavarra*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En los dos primeros aos de la segunda presidencia de
Rafael Caldera se formularon siete planes econmicos de nombres llamativos,
presentados todos con una fanfarria publicitaria que prometa corregir el
dficit fiscal, estabilizar la moneda, reducir tanto la deuda interna como
la externa y abatir la inflacin.  En cada caso, se nos dijo que tras un
sacrificio inicial, la prosperidad y la bonanza estaban a la vuelta de la
esquina.
<dd>	En dos aos, el presidente Caldera ha acumulado el mayor dficit fiscal de
la historia venezolana, aumentado la deuda y producido las mayores y ms
brutales devaluaciones. Ahora sus ministros anuncian que tendremos que
sufrir una inflacin superior al 100%; le "cambiarn el perfil" a la deuda
externa, pero la seguirn aumentando para pagar con ms deuda los "programas
sociales". En la historia mundial de la planificacin no hay absurdo
semejante y en Venezuela no hay precedente para un fracaso de esta magnitud.
Como barco a la deriva en mar tormentoso, el gobierno de Caldera pasa de un
plan a otro. Sus objetivos se anuncian en cada caso con trompetas solemnes,
pero al poco tiempo los planes y objetivos se hunden en el olvido y nadie se
molesta en recordar las promesas ni contrastarlas con los resultados. No
hubo nunca una razn, una excusa o una explicacin. Simplemente, cada  Plan
se enterr en silencio y al poco tiempo se produjo... otro plan. El ltimo
es la "Agenda Venezuela". 
<dd>No podemos olvidar que seguimos gobernados por un presidente que en 1994 se
vio enfrentado a problemas econmicos que no entenda y que hoy sigue sin
entender. Por fuerza de sus errores y omisiones, el gobierno ha sido llevado
a hacer en 1996 lo que en 1993 Rafael Caldera dijo que jams hara. Y la
actual campaa publicitaria para vender la "Agenda Venezuela" es un insulto
a la inteligencia de los venezolanos, utilizando actores de la televisin
para mentirle al pas acerca de su presente y su futuro. 
<dd>Especialmente irritante es la publicidad que empieza afirmando que un pas
con $18 mil millones en ingresos anuales no es pobre y termina diciendo que
no es cobarde el pas que libert a medio continente. Es inslito que un
gobierno que ha tenido que acudir de rodillas ante el prestamista
internacional de ltima instancia, porque no puede pagar lo que debe, alegue
por boca de un actor en un mensaje pagado que no es pobre porque recibe una
enorme renta petrolera. La verdad de la magnitud de su ingreso petrolero es
precisamente lo que incrimina al presidente Caldera como incompetente para
administrarla. Hacer una propaganda falsa para generar un optimismo
mentiroso contradice los sacrificios que sus ministros anuncian. Apelar a
una emocin patritica es comparar nuestro lamentable presente con nuestro
pasado heroico. 
<dd>Slo un gobierno encerrado en el laberinto de su soledad es capaz de hacer
una campaa publicitaria que implcitamente presenta el ltimo plan de
poltica econmica como genial correctivo de los errores del mismo gobierno. 
Si en vez de los cmicos locutores y actores contratados se hicieran
anuncios con los ex ministros y dems responsables del caos, quiz los
venezolanos empezaran a creer en la Agenda Venezuela. Pues slo la
sumatoria de tales talentos sera capaz de explicar cmo es bueno y porqu
est en buen camino un plan econmico que le exprime a una economa
deprimida los recursos que necesita para volcarlos en mantener un aparato
burocrtico parasitario, estril, inepto y corrupto. Slo ellos son capaces
de explicar la maravilla de devaluar la moneda para producir una "utilidad
cambiaria", con la cual nivelar este ao el dficit fiscal y, al mismo
tiempo, garantizar que el ao entrante se lograr acabar con la inflacin. 
Ahora bien, cuando la "Agenda Venezuela" desemboque en inevitable
catstrofe, que no  vengan a decirnos que su fracaso se debi a las voces
agoreras, a los profetas del desastre que sembraron rumores y minaron la
confianza.
<dd>El "caso Venezuela" es la madre de todas las paradojas. La ms importante es
que la economa venezolana ha logrado acopiar todos los vicios y pecados del
capitalismo sin obtener ninguna de sus ventajas, al igual que todos los
vicios y pecados del estatismo socializante sin  ninguno de sus logros. Como
lo han constatado los economistas extranjeros, las reformas tropiezan con
problemas similares a los que enfrentan los pases del ex bloque sovitico.
Aquella parte de su economa que podra llamarse "privada" o "capitalista"
tiene la moral flaca y los msculos fofos por proteccionismos, subsidios y
toda clase de malos hbitos que no la recomiendan para competir exitosamente
fuera de su invernadero, dentro del cual actan con un mercado insincero e
imperfecto que anula las ventajas del capitalismo, mientras exagera sus
defectos. La economa privada venezolana es un muestrario vivo de los peores
vicios del mercantilismo inmoral y del socialismo inepto.
Winston Churchill deca que el vicio inherente del capitalismo es el reparto
desigual de la riqueza que genera y el vicio inherente del socialismo es el
reparto igualitario de la miseria que produce. Los venezolanos hemos logrado
llevar el defecto corregible del capitalismo a extremos obscenos y el vicio
del socialismo a magnitudes monstruosas. &copy;

EL 'COMERCIALISMO' OLIMPICO DE ATLANTA
</h2>     
<P>
Filip Palda*
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).
-- Algunos de los burcratas que controlan losjuegos internacionales acusaron de "vulgar" y de "comercializada" las
recientes olimpadas de Atlanta, prometiendo impedir su repeticin.
Samaranch y su grupo prefieren el fuete gubernamental antes que la mano
invisible del mercado. Pero veamos lo que en realidad sucedi en Atlanta.<P>
 Los juegos fueron organizados por gente que se puso de acuerdo entre s. La
belleza de los acuerdos y de los contratos es que obliga a la gente a pensar
y a hacer el mejor uso de la informacin. Si los organizadores quieren
construir un parque no emiten, simplemente, un cheque con cargo a los
contribuyentes de impuestos, sino que tienen que convencer a patrocinantes
como la IBM para que aporten el dinero. Entonces, esa empresa se pregunta si
el despliegue de su logotipo en ese parque justifica la inversin que los
organizadores exigen. Los ejecutivos tratarn de calcular si ello
representar un beneficio para los accionistas de la empresa, de manera
similar a como beneficiar a los espectadores y usuarios del parque. Slo
cuando las dos partes resultan beneficiadas funciona el mercado. Por eso las
olimpadas organizadas conforme al libre mercado, como la de Atlanta, son
democrticas y eficientes.
<P> Cuando el gobierno financia los juegos, los acuerdos sensatos son
reemplazados por imposiciones y tcticas de fuerza. Los contribuyentes
tienen que aportar el dinero, les guste o no. Ese tipo de financiamiento
produce una olimpada tipo Montreal, donde se cometieron equivocaciones por
mil millones de dlares a costa del pblico cautivo.
<P> El financiamiento a travs de impuestos impide que los organizadores hagan
uso de sus cerebros en inventar y desarrollar mejores maneras de servir a
los atletas. A qu burcrata con una bolsa de dinero proveniente de los
impuestos se le hubiera ocurrido el concepto del Aro Reebok? El Aro Reebok
era el sitio en Atlanta donde los atletas rusos participantes en las
olimpadas podan escoger equipos deportivos Reebok, por cortesa de la
empresa. En una olimpada de libre mercado, las naciones que hasta hace poco
estaban dispuestas a destruirse mutuamente buscaban maneras de ayudar a sus
atletas.
<P> La prensa ignor todo lo bueno que surgi al organizar los juegos con la
ayuda del comercio. Los periodistas ms bien se quejaban de la lentitud de
los autobuses en el trfico, de desperfectos en las computadoras y de los
agresivos vendedores de camisetas. Los reporteros no supieron detectar la
noticia ms importante: cmo los atletas, los empresarios y los espectadores
obtuvieron algo sin obligar al distante contribuyente de impuestos para que
pagara la cuenta por su entretenimiento y disfrute.

CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En un reciente viaje a Europa cruc por carretera
las fronteras de varios pases y lo nico que vi fueron instalaciones
abandonadas, donde antes detenan a los vehculos para pedir pasaportes y
revisar las maletas de los pasajeros. Ahora, esas garitas estn polvorientas
y desoladas. Los autos y la gente circulan libremente.
El extranjero que llega a Europa solamente tiene que presentar su pasaporte
y visa cuando entra a alguna nacin de la Comunidad Europea, pero una vez
dentro, se mueve libremente por todos los pases integrantes de la unin.
En una de las obsoletas instalaciones fronterizas me detuve, tom fotos y
pens sobre todos los aos que innecesariamente y sin ningn beneficio al
bien comn los gobiernos de los diversos pases que ahora integran la
Comunidad Europea obstaculizaron el libre paso de personas y mercancas en
nombre de la soberana, el nacionalismo, la seguridad interna, la proteccin
al empleo, a las empresas nacionales, etc.<p>
	El camino para abolir las innecesarias y antieconmicas fronteras fue
largo, azaroso y controvertido, pero es un triunfo de la razn, el sentido
comn y los principios econmicos sobre el egosmo, los intereses de ciertos
grupos y los mal entendidos conceptos de nacionalismo y de soberana.<p>
	La ausencia de fronteras entre Espaa y Francia no ha desdibujado la
nacionalidad francesa ni daado la soberana espaola. Los espaoles siguen
siendo espaoles, los franceses, franceses y los portugueses, portugueses.<p>
	Desgraciadamente, en Mxico y el resto de Centro y Sudamrica todava se
escuchan voces arcaicas que identifican los valores patrios y nacionales con
una burocracia que, con aires de perdonavidas, deciden quin entra o no
entra en un pas y qu mercancas pasan.<p>
Las aduanas y las fronteras no nacen como consecuencia de una necesidad
social ni mucho menos para mejorar la convivencia entre los pueblos, sino
como un medio de recaudar dinero para hacer frente a los gastos de los
gobernantes, proteger a empresarios amigos en perjuicio de los niveles de
vida de los habitantes.<p>
	Actualmente se mencionan los ms diversos argumentos para mantener las
fronteras entre los pases de Latinoamrica o con Estados Unidos:
diferencias de ingresos, migraciones masivas, asimetras de los mercados,
etc. Todas esas razones y argumentos tambin obstaculizaron durante muchos
aos la integracin Europea, pero al final se impuso la sensatez y el
sentido comn ante el miedo, los intereses mezquinos y los burcratas que
buscan reglamentaciones, obstculos y aduanas como una fuente de poder y
enriquecimiento.<p>
Despus de dos guerras y de millones de muertos, los europeos se dieron
cuenta que la nica forma de evitar una nueva confrontacin es la
integracin econmica.<p>
Aparecern lderes y estadistas en Iberoamrica que recojan la experiencia
europea y luchen porque en un futuro, lo ms cercano posible, las fronteras
entre nuestros pases se conviertan en similares vestigios de la
irracionalidad econmica?  Fronteras que durante tres cuartos de siglo nos
han mantenido divididos y que han sido un factor determinante de nuestro
atraso y pobreza.  <p>

<H2>GASTO SOCIAL O DERROCHE FISCAL?</H2>
Luis Pazos*<br>
<p>
CUIDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Una crtica frecuente de los partidos de izquierda
al gobierno es el insuficiente nivel de gasto social. Constantemente se
exige el aument del gasto pblico en obras sociales. 
<P>
El presidente Ernesto Zedillo, en referencia a la importancia del gasto
social en su administracin, seal en su segundo informe anual que "de cada
cien pesos que el gobierno programa gastar, ms de la mitad, 54 pesos, se
destinan a mejorar las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y
las comunidades". Ese porcentaje, ms de la mitad del gasto total del
estado, es similar a lo que tericamente ha sido destinado por casi todos
los gobiernos mexicanos en los ltimos 25 aos a lo que llaman gasto social.
Las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y las comunidades,
tericamente destinatarias de ese gasto social, lejos de mejorar en el
ltimo cuarto de siglo han empeorado su situacin. Aritmticamente podemos
concluir que los 54 pesos de cada cien de gasto social han sido casi en su
totalidad derrochados y desperdiciados.
<P>
Sobre el nmero de familias beneficiadas por los subsidios, el presidente
seal en su ltimo informe: "A travs del sistema de abasto popular se
atiende a cerca de 30 millones de personas, principalmente del medio rural.
Se apoya a 2,8 millones de familias de bajos ingresos para el consumo de
tortilla y a 5,2 millones de nios para el de leche". El abasto popular que,
segn dijo el presidente atiende a 30 millones de personas, se instrumenta
principalmente a travs de la Confederacin Nacional de Subsistencias
Populares (CONASUPO). Es un hecho conocido por el pblico que ese organismo,
representativo del gasto social, ha sido una de las principales fuentes de
enriquecimiento de la alta burocracia. Gran parte de lo subsidios al maz y
a la leche han ido a parar realmente a cuentas en el extranjero de
familiares de funcionarios, no slo bajo Salinas de Gortari, sino desde que
fue creada esa empresa estatal. 
<P>
Una cosa es ayudar a los ms pobres y otra sostener que esa ayuda se d a
travs de la burocracia gubernamental que, como lo demuestra la experiencia
en todo el mundo, en poco beneficia a los marginados. La solucin no es
cambiar los directivos de los organismos estatales de asistencia social cada
seis aos ni encarcelar a aquellos que circunstancialmente se les descubren
manejos fraudulentos, sino buscar nuevas formas para que los recursos ahora
destinados al gasto social no se queden en el camino, principalmente en
manos de quienes los administran.
<P>
Si el gobierno dejara de gastar los 54 pesos por cada 100 pesos que destina
al llamado gasto social, que a la fecha en muy poco ha beneficiado a los
mexicanos pobres y recorta, a la vez, en 54% sus gastos, podra reducir, sin
crear un dficit, tanto el tope del impuesto sobre la renta a la mitad (a
17%),  como el IVA tambin a la mitad (a 7,5% ) y rebajar al mismo tiempo el
impuesto de la gasolina tambin en 50%. Esos cambios provocaran tal
actividad y bienestar econmico, que los tericos destinatarios del gasto
social encontraran de inmediato oportunidades de elevar su nivel de vida. 
Por qu es difcil instrumentar tan favorables cambios?  Porque cientos de
miles de burcratas han sido por mucho tiempo los verdaderos beneficiarios
de gran parte del llamado gasto social y se oponen a perder sus prebendas.
La mayor parte del gasto social se queda en sueldos, prestaciones,
desviaciones, negocios y gastos de operacin de la burocracia encargada de
manejarlo. Y aun lo poco que llega a los pobres es distribuido con criterio
de clientelismo poltico ms que de acuerdo a verdaderas necesidades
econmicas. 
<P>
Existe una clara contradiccin entre quienes por un lado sealan la
inoperancia y corrupcin del gasto social, pero al mismo tiempo exigen que
el gobierno incremente ese mismo gasto social.

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA
</H2>
Sylvia Pasquier*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA YORK
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La creciente preocupacin por el manejo de la basura y
los desperdicios tom auge en 1987, cuando una gran barcaza, la Mobro 4000,
naveg miles de kilmetros tratando de encontrar un lugar donde le
permitieran descargar la basuras producida por los habitantes de Long
Island, en Estados Unidos. A partir de entonces, Nueva York y otras grandes
ciudades tratan de determinar la mejor manera de manejar la basura.
 El "reciclaje" de la basura ha tenido gran aceptacin como proceso para
obtener beneficios econmicos y proteger el medio ambiente. Pero una
revisin de los resultados obtenidos en Nueva York nos deja ver el gran
trecho que existe entre la propaganda oficial y los verdaderos resultados.
<P>
                La ciudad de Nueva York fue pionera en 1988 en promover el
reciclaje como el mejor mtodo de disponer de los desechos, ejemplo seguido
luego por varias ciudades europeas, principalmente en Alemania. Winston
Porter fue administrador asistente de la EPA (Agencia de Proteccin
Ambiental de Estados Unidos), dependencia gubernamental que fij una meta de
25% como cantidad a reciclar de la basura. Hoy Porter es asesor de varias
ciudades, a las cuales aconseja que abandonen tales metas tan poco realistas.
<P>
                Cada vez que un vehculo recolector de basura completa su
carga de botellas y de latas recogidas de las aceras de Nueva York, la
ciudad pierde dinero. El programa de reciclaje consume recursos, requiere
una administracin especial y una campaa continua para ensear a la gente
lo que debe hacer con docenas de diferentes productos: reciclar botellas de
leche pero no cartones de leche; peridicos s pero no el papel utilizado en
la construccin, etc.
<P>
                A pesar de que el programa de reciclaje lleva varios aos,
la mayora de los habitantes de Nueva York no comprenden todas las reglas
vigentes. El programa tambin requiere de agentes que inspeccionen los
desperdicios y distribuyan notificaciones de multas. Sobre todo, obliga a
utilizar muchos ms vehculos y mucho ms personal que antes, cuando no se
reciclaba.
<P>
                Recolectar una tonelada de desperdicios y basura reciclable
en la ciudad de Nueva York es tres veces ms caro que recolectar una
tonelada de basura no reciclable. Por cada tonelada de vidrio, plsticos y
metales que el vehculo entrega a una empresa privada de reciclaje, la
ciudad de Nueva York gasta actualmente $200 ms de lo que gastara
transportando basura a una zona de relleno municipal.
<P>
                Los directores del proyecto esperaban recuperar este costo
adicional vendiendo los materiales obtenidos, pero su precio jams se acerc
siquiera al costo del manejo. Las empresas privadas de reciclaje exigen,
adems, honorarios por su trabajo, ya que sus costos de procesamiento de la
basura son mayores que los eventuales precios de venta de los materiales
reciclados. Por este motivo, la ciudad habiendo ya invertido $200 por cada
tonelada de material recogido debe pagar otros $40 para deshacerse de ste.
<P>
                El programa de reciclaje le cuesta a la ciudad de Nueva York
unos $100 millones al ao y esta cifra solamente incluye el dinero
proveniente del presupuesto municipal. Hay que agregar el costo escondido de
todo el trabajo efectuado gratis por los habitantes de la ciudad en
cooperacin con el programa de reciclaje. Recientemente, un estudiante de la
Universidad de Columbia sum el trabajo de una semana, siguiendo al pie de
la letra los reglamentos municipales. Le tomaron 8 minutos a la semana
escoger y llevar al stano del edificio donde vive dos kilos de latas y
botellas. Si la ciudad tuviera que pagar personal para que realizara ese
trabajo, costara otros $800 por cada tonelada de reciclaje.
<P>
                Si calculamos tambin el costo del espacio asignado para
guardar todo el material reciclable hasta tanto pasen a recogerlo, segn los
precios actuales de la vivienda y asignando slo un metro cuadrado por
familia, este costo alcanza otros $2.000 por tonelada. Por lo tanto, el
costo verdadero de una tonelada de material reciclable es ms de $3.000.
Cuando los burcratas y expertos ambientales hablan maravillas de los
programas de reciclaje, no toman en cuenta sus horribles costos. Si
ignoramos la relacin costo/beneficio de los programas gubernamentales, todo
suena lindo, bueno y deseable.

<P>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (AIPE).- Desde el tiempo de los conquistadores espaoles,
la bsqueda de riqueza en Chile se dirigi hacia el suelo. Para algunos esto
signific la exploracin en busca de minerales valiosos escondidos bajo
tierra: oro y plata, despus salitre y finalmente cobre. Para otros fue el
cultivo de la tierra frtil que produce trigo, frutas y madera. Siglos ms
tarde, las principales exportaciones de Chile todava provienen del suelo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero si la importancia econmica de la tierra es un asunto en que existe
pleno acuerdo, la interrogante acerca de "cmo" debe generarse la riqueza en
Chile ha sido el campo de batalla de  doctrinas econmicas opuestas. Ese
debate, que adopt especial fuerza en los aos 60, degener en un violento y
agudo conflicto que produjo una enorme crisis econmica y la quiebra del
sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La doctrina socialista, ya sea en su variante comunitaria o marxista, no
comprendi que el verdadero capital productivo es aquel que deriva su valor
a travs de la creatividad y diligencia de su propietario operando en
mercados libres. Por el contrario, erigieron al Estado como gran
redistribuidor de riqueza.	La esencia de esa visin estatista se encarn en
la gran Reforma Agraria de 1966. El gobierno democratacristiano de la poca
intent demostrar que la riqueza se poda redistribuir tan fcilmente como
la tierra.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Agraria se extendera
luego a la expropiacin de la minera del cobre y a un ataque generalizado
al derecho de propiedad. Los estatistas creen que la propiedad no necesita
realmente un dueo y son firmes partidarios de la propiedad pblica, pues
ella efectivamente significa que nadie es dueo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero no slo debe tener la propiedad un claro dueo; el dueo debe tener
la suficiente seguridad para que se interese por mantener e invertir en su
propiedad. Si el Estado puede disponer de la propiedad privada, quitndole a
unos y entregndole a otros, ni los ganadores ni los perdedores de ese
ejercicio del poder poltico se sentirn protegidos y seguros de su
propiedad, como para asumir riesgos e invertir capitales para incrementar su
valor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1981, la Reforma Minera chilena enfrent a la visin socialista que
haba generado la Reforma Agraria y gener la ocasin para un claro y
dramtico contraste. Al crear verdaderos derechos de propiedad en el sector
econmico de mayor tamao y de mayor sensibilidad poltica, el mensaje a los
inversionistas nacionales y extranjeros fue que la propiedad privada en
Chile era, desde ese momento, un derecho absolutamente seguro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As fue como, en 15 aos, se llevaron a cabo en Chile dos reformas de gran
importancia y conceptualmente antagnicas, cada una ofreciendo su definicin
del tipo de economa que sera preferible para el pas. Un gobierno
demuestra coherencia en su poltica econmica segn cmo contesta una
pregunta bsica: Cul es la llave del tesoro? La Reforma Agraria y la
Reforma Minera fueron dos respuestas distintas y contrapuestas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La Reforma Agraria produjo una crisis de la produccin agrcola y la
quiebra de la fbrica social del pas, mientras que la Reforma Minera ha
significado inversiones extranjeras por $7,153 millones, destinados a
desarrollar riqueza, crear trabajos productivos, transferir tecnologa y
recursos sustanciales para invertir en capital humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Minera de 1981 consolid
una visin nueva acerca de cmo crear riqueza.  Aunque en Chile tal visin
gan el debate de los 80, esta visin fundamental no ha sido todava
aceptada ni adoptada en temas que sern de la mayor importancia en el siglo
XXI. En efecto, la contestacin a cul debe ser el motor del progreso
nacional?, permanece indefinida en la ambigua respuesta de la economa mixta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La economa mixta que postulan los estatistas es la que exprime con toda
clase de impuestos al sector privado moderno y eficiente para apoyar al
sector pblico anacrnico, ineficaz, politizado y crecientemente corrupto.
La doctrina de la economa mixta es la que condena a los nios pobres a
educarse en escuelas pblicas mediocres, en vez de darles acceso a las
escuelas privadas que escoge, casi sin excepcin, cualquier familia con
recursos suficientes, independientemente de su inclinacin poltica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero est ocurriendo un cambio trascendental. Si histricamente la riqueza
fue creada poniendo los recursos naturales al servicio del hombre, en el
futuro la llave de la creacin de riqueza -la llave del tesoro- ser el
cultivo de la inteligencia y el conocimiento humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hoy la extraccin de minerales o productos agrcolas del suelo se apoya
ms en el uso de inteligencia que en fuerza humana. Pero aunque Chile ha
modernizado importantes sectores de su economa y de su sociedad, el sistema
estatal de educacin se encuentra en una profunda crisis porque est basado
en la misma estructura conceptual que origin la Reforma Agraria y que
mantiene a  la mayor empresa  de cobre, Codelco, en poder del Estado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es un trgico error postular que la preocupacin especial por los pobres
exige que el Estado produzca cobre y educacin. Todo lo contrario. No
podemos permitir que la mala calidad de la educacin estatal los condene a
una pobreza perpetua, cuando existe una alternativa.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El meollo del asunto es que la definicin de lo que es riqueza cambi y la
poltica moderna debe reconocerlo as. Hoy en da la riqueza fundamental es
el capital humano y el insumo bsico es el conocimiento. Es probable que sea
menos perjudicial para un pas tener empresas estatales produciendo acero o
explotando minas que escuelas administradas por la burocracia estatal. Una
profunda reforma educacional es la tarea ms urgente e importante de nuestra
sociedad.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es absurdo seguir considerando a las escuelas como parte del gasto social
asignado para mitigar los efectos de la pobreza. Por el contrario, las
escuelas deben estar en manos de los ms capaces en llevar adelante los
mejores proyectos educacionales -programas, metodologas, infraestructura-
que compiten entre s, para ofrecer a los jvenes las mejores alternativas.
Esto slo pueden hacerlo empresarios privados dispuestos a desarrollar su
iniciativa y arriesgar sus capitales a cambio de una legtima ganancia. Los
profesores deben dejar de ser funcionarios pblicos regidos por un estatuto
que uniforma la mediocridad, pasando a ser actores activos de los proyectos
educacionales y recibiendo mejor ingreso, ya sea por la prestacin de sus
servicios o como dueos de las escuelas. El rol del Estado debe centrarse en
subsidiar la educacin de los ms pobres y asegurar la transparencia y
competitividad del sistema.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As las escuelas podrn transformarse en los centros productivos
estratgicos del pas porque all se jugar la ventaja competitiva de las
naciones en el siglo XXI. La educacin no slo reemplazar al suelo frtil y
a los yacimientos de minerales como el recurso clave para el desarrollo y la
creacin de riqueza, sino que tambin ser el ms significativo determinante
de la eliminacin de la pobreza.

<h2>
EXITOSA REFORMA DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>

Jos Piera*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Est ocurriendo en el mundo una verdadera
revolucin social ante el fracaso de los sistemas estatales de pensiones. La
crisis de la seguridad social sobreviene an en naciones tan prsperas como
Estados Unidos, Alemania y Japn.
<dd>	La buena noticia es que Amrica Latina ha sido pionera en lograr la
solucin. Hace 15  aos en Chile se instaur un sistema privado de cuentas
de ahorro individuales que conduce a una verdadera seguridad social. En
Per, Argentina y Colombia se han creado sistemas similares y es posible que
tambin lo hagan Mxico, Bolivia y El Salvador. Apostara que casi todos los
pases de Amrica Latina ingresarn al siglo XXI con la ventaja competitiva
de un sistema de pensiones privado de capitalizacin individual.
<dd>	Es conveniente mantener lo esencial del modelo chileno, adaptndolo a la
realidad nacional, especialmente en la definicin de la transicin desde el
sistema de reparto al de capitalizacin. Siempre surge la siguiente
pregunta: cules son las claves del xito del modelo chileno de pensiones,
aquellos factores esenciales que deben preservarse en toda reforma?
<dd>	Al celebrar 15 aos de funcionamiento del sistema de Administradores de
Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) es oportuno enumerar 20 factores esenciales:
<dd>                1. El sistema tradicional de reparto tiene una falla
estructural al basarse en una visin errada de la conducta humana. Al romper
la relacin que debe existir entre esfuerzo y recompensa, el sistema de
reparto origina conductas que producen, tarde o temprano, graves
consecuencias econmicas y sociales. El problema slo se corrige cuando se
crea un sistema donde la pensin de cada persona resulta de su esfuerzo de
ahorro durante la vida de trabajo. Esto adems permite ampliar la cobertura
del sistema a trabajadores independientes que quieran participar.
<dd>                2. El sistema de capitalizacin individual reemplaza
completamente al sistema de reparto. Siempre existe la tentacin de
soluciones mixtas, pues algunos suponen que al introducir elementos de dos
concepciones diferentes obtienen lo mejor de ambas. Eso es un error.
Generalmente la solucin mixta es un engendro que al carecer de coherencia
interna alimenta contradicciones que ocasionan daos graves. Si la
capitalizacin es mejor que el reparto, por qu mantener un beneficio
universal entregado por el Estado y financiado con un impuesto a la
contratacin de mano de obra?  La coexistencia entre el reparto y la
capitalizacin tiende a no ser posible, pues le permite a sucesivos
gobiernos mostrar preferencia por un sistema u otro.
<dd>                3. El sistema es administrado por el sector privado. En
Singapur hay un sistema de capitalizacin individual nico administrado por
el "Central Provident Fund" del Estado. Ello tiende al mal uso de los
recursos y es contradictorio con una sociedad libre. 
<dd>                4. Las empresas privadas que operan el sistema de pensiones
-las AFP- son de giro nico. No conviene confundir el producto del sistema,
que es una pensin al final de la vida, con los otros productos que ofrece
el sistema financiero. No debe mezclarse la administracin de un ahorro
obligatorio y de largo plazo con la inversin de recursos que toleran
niveles de riesgos superiores. En muchos pases los sistemas bancarios son
oligoplicos y no es conveniente reproducir esa estructura en el manejo del
sistema de pensiones. Entre las AFP y otras instituciones financieras pueden
haber relaciones contractuales, como convenios de servicios que reduzcan los
costos del sistema, pero se debe mantener la naturaleza nica de su giro.
<dd>	5. Los ahorros de los trabajadores reciben la rentabilidad de las
inversiones. Esto es necesario tanto por razones de seguridad como de
estabilidad poltica del sistema. En efecto, si las AFP pactaran de antemano
una tasa de retorno, podran quebrar al realizar malas inversiones, poniendo
en peligro los ahorros. Al distinguir entre Administradora (la cual se
financia con una comisin) y Fondo se logra el objetivo. El Fondo de
Pensiones puede tener oscilaciones de rentabilidad, pero en la medida que
est bien diversificado, esa variacin tiene los lmites propios de lo que
son las rentabilidades nacionales o mundiales. As un Fondo de Pensiones no
puede quebrar, aunque s la Administradora, involucrando en este caso slo
el capital del empresario. Y al comprender los trabajadores que el valor de
su cuenta de ahorro previsional depende de la buena marcha de las empresas y
de la economa, se logra su adhesin al sistema de pensiones y se estimula
un comportamiento responsable.
<dd>                6. Hay libre entrada de empresas del sector. Las condiciones
competitivas permiten optimizar la eficiencia en la oferta de cualquier bien
o servicio. Adems, el sistema de capitalizacin individual es intensivo en
el procesamiento de informacin, rea en la cual estn ocurriendo
vertiginosos avances tecnolgicos. La competencia de inversionistas tanto
nacionales como extranjeros asegura que estos avances sean incorporados y
que la reduccin de costos sea traspasada a los trabajadores a travs de
menores comisiones y mejor servicio.
<dd>	7. El tamao de cada AFP lo determina el mercado y no lmites arbitrarios
impuestos por el gobierno sobre el xito de cada AFP. Si hay una AFP que
logre una fraccin importante del mercado es porque es favorecida por los
propios trabajadores y no porque la autoridad as lo dispuso. Las
deseconomas de escala han impedido la monopolizacin del mercado.
<dd>	8. No hay AFP estatal, para lo cual no hay justificacin. De existir se
produce una competencia desleal con las AFP privadas.
<dd>	9. El trabajador tiene libertad para elegir su AFP. El sistema est basado
en la capacidad de los trabajadores para tomar decisiones sobre la AFP que
le manejar su cuenta de ahorro individual. Australia tiene un sistema
privado, pero  las personas deben afiliarse segn el gremio al que
pertenecen, crendose clientes cautivos que no reciben ni el mejor servicio
ni la mejor rentabilidad.
<dd>	10. Las comisiones que cobran las AFP son libres. Los precios son seales
fundamentales en una economa libre. Por lo tanto, las comisiones -el precio
de los servicios que dan las AFP- deben ser determinadas por el mercado
competitivo. En Chile se fortaleci la ley antimonopolio para impedir la
colusin entre empresas en fijar comisiones. Las autoridades deben asegurar
condiciones competitivas, pero no caer en la tentacin de fijar los precios,
con todas las distorsiones y presiones que ello genera.
<dd>	11. La transicin contempl la libertad para quedarse en el sistema de
reparto o trasladarse al sistema de capitalizacin. Ello hace ms difcil
cuantificar los aspectos fiscales de la transicin, pero tiene un gran valor
para las personas y crea confianza.
<dd>	12. Se les reconocen aportes hechos al sistema de reparto a los que optan
por el nuevo sistema. En Chile se aplic una frmula transparente y eficaz,
el Bono Reconocimiento que reflej los beneficios ya ganados por el
trabajador en el sistema de reparto. Esta compensacin debe existir para no
penalizar a las personas que ya han hecho aportes sustanciales en el sistema
estatal y prefieren que sus contribuciones futuras vayan a su cuenta de
ahorro individual.
<dd>	13. Los nuevos trabajadores entran al sistema de capitalizacin porque no
es responsable mantener abierta la puerta de un sistema de reparto que no es
viable en el largo plazo.
<dd>	14. Creacin de un organismo fiscalizador tecnificado con los recursos
necesarios, tanto humanos como financieros, para cumplir su funcin. En
Chile tenemos un organismo altamente profesional y despolitizado, la
Superintendencia de AFP.
<dd>	15. La regulacin del sistema ha sido crecientemente liberal. Nuestro
enfoque fue radical pero con una ejecucin conservadora. Una vez establecida
la capitalizacin es prudente enfatizar  la seguridad del nuevo sistema,
mientras se adquiere experiencia. Se impusieron estrictas reglas de
elegibilidad y diversificacin de las inversiones que se van liberalizando a
medida que el sistema madura.
<dd>	16. La transparencia es total. La confianza se gana con informacin plena.
Los trabajadores tienen derecho a saber quines son los dueos de las AFP,
en qu invierten los recursos, los niveles de comisiones, etc. Es importante
esta transparencia y posibilita a los dirigentes sindicales asesorar a sus
afiliados y a los analistas, consultores, clasificadores de riesgos e
instituciones financieras emitir opiniones sobre la calidad de los
portafolios de inversin. En Chile, la Superintendencia de AFP publica un
informe mensual que contiene toda la informacin relevante del sistema.
Adems, las AFP estn obligadas a proporcionar informacin peridica a sus
afiliados acerca del estado de sus cuentas.
<dd>	17. La reforma de las pensiones fue parte de un esfuerzo integral de
liberalizacin de la economa y la sociedad. La capitalizacin individual
funciona muchsimo mejor si opera en una economa abierta y con mercados
libres. La apertura del mercado de capitales permite a las AFP aprovechar
oportunidades de inversin en el exterior. 
<dd>	18. La reforma fue precedida por un gran esfuerzo comunicacional. Una
reforma de esta naturaleza afecta la vida de los trabajadores. La inquietud
e incertidumbre son inevitables por lo que las autoridades tienen que
explicar el sistema en trminos simples pero veraces. Una vez operando, la
funcin informativa es asumida por las AFP, sus asociaciones y los medios de
comunicacin.
<dd>	19. La meta fue lograr el sistema ptimo. Para ello se requiere liderazgo.
No se puede disear una reforma de este tipo basndose en encuestas y en un
consenso artificial que diluyen la reforma ptima. El verdadero lder es
aquel que acta segn lo que conviene al pas, aun cuando sea impopular en
el corto plazo.
<dd>	20. Estado de "eterna vigilancia": siempre habrn personas, partidos,
corrientes de opinin, grupos de inters que aspiran torcer el sistema en su
beneficio y en desmedro del resto. Hay que defender los principios centrales
del sistema, rechazando cualquier propuesta que vaya en direccin contraria,
manteniendo el esfuerzo educativo y comunicacional.
<dd>	El sistema chileno de pensiones es mucho ms que una manera de generar
buenos ingresos para los jubilados, crear ahorro para la economa y
estimular el crecimiento econmico. En ltimo trmino, es un acto de fe en
la libertad de los individuos y en las maravillas que los individuos pueden
hacer cuando son libres.&copy

<H2>ESTADOS UNIDOS Y EL FUTURO DE COLOMBIA</H2>
Miguel Posada S.*<p>
BOGOTA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- 	El ingreso de dineros del narcotrfico a la pasada campaa
electoral en Colombia desat una crisis poltica interna en el pas y gener
un deterioro notable en las relaciones del gobierno colombiano con Estados
Unidos. El gobierno norteamericano ha sido actor importante en el proceso
desatado, aplicando presin sobre el gobierno del presidente Samper en
varias formas.
<dd>
Primero vino la descertificacin de Colombia como pas comprometido con la
lucha antidrogas. Esta descertificacin deja el camino abierto al ejecutivo
de Estados Unidos para aplicar las sanciones que estime conveniente contra
el pas. Despus del proceso en la Cmara de Representantes que absolvi al
presidente Samper, el gobierno norteamericano le retir al mandatario
colombiano su visa de ingreso a Estados Unidos. Esta sancin, aplicada
adems a otros personajes de la vida poltica nacional, es la ltima
actuacin hasta el momento. Queda encima del gobierno colombiano y del pas
la espada de Damocles de las sanciones comerciales. 
<dd>	
En la batalla contra el llamado Cartel de Cali, la polica y las fuerzas
armadas han sido exitosas. Con la excepcin de Helmer Herrera, la cpula del
Cartel est en la crcel o fue dada de baja. Obviamente quedan muchos narcos
de menor jerarqua por detectar y capturar. Fue precisamente informacin
contenida en los documentos hallados en los muchos allanamientos realizados
la que aceler la crisis al revelar la profundidad de la penetracin que
haba logrado el Cartel en la clase poltica colombiana. La presin
norteamericana, odiosa por ser externa, ha sido importante para mantener en
marcha este proceso de limpieza, vital para Colombia ms que para los mismos
Estados Unidos. 
<dd>	
Indudablemente la incertidumbre causada por la crisis poltica ha tenido un
costo importante para la economa colombiana. Por otra parte, el dao a las
relaciones bilaterales que se ha producido, no slo por las actuaciones
concretas, sino por las declaraciones imprudentes de funcionarios de los dos
gobiernos, especialmente las del ministro del Interior Horacio Serpa,
probablemente ser subsanable en el mediano plazo. Pero queda el tema de las
sanciones. Aplicarlas sera un grave error por parte del gobierno
norteamericano. El retiro de preferencias arancelarias u otras sanciones de
tipo econmico ocasionaran graves daos a la economa colombiana.
Afectaran precisamente a las exportaciones sanas del pas. En el campo
poltico debilitara a quienes apoyan la limpieza y se abrira el campo a
quienes, apelando a un nacionalismo malsano, conviven y apoyan a los
narcotraficantes y a la guerrilla, esta ltima convertida hoy en el Tercer
Cartel del narcotrfico.
<dd>	
Es probable que desde Washington sea difcil apreciar la realidad de la
situacin poltica colombiana. El proceso de limpieza, como es apenas
natural, ha generado una polarizacin y un fraccionamiento poltico. Hoy no
se ven candidatos serios y competentes dentro de los partidos tradicionales
que tengan buenas probabilidades de tener xito electoral. Es posible que en
los dos aos que faltan para las elecciones presidenciales algunos
candidatos aceptables se puedan perfilar con ms claridad, pero una actitud
arrogante y falta de tacto de parte del gobierno de Estados Unidos trabajar
en contra de los buenos candidatos y a favor de otros, populistas o de
ideologa de izquierda, cuyo triunfo sera desastroso para el pas. La
embajada norteamericana en Colombia tiene la gran responsabilidad de
asesorar bien al Departamento de Estado en la materia. En estos momentos se
requiere firmeza pero tambin discrecin y paciencia de parte de Washington
para no generar una animadversin hacia Estados Unidos que hara difcil la
necesaria colaboracin de dos pases enfrentados a un enemigo comn.

<h2>
CHILE: POLITICOS QUIEREN MONOPOLIOS
</h2>
Ciro Quintana*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los empresarios estn pendientes de las encuestas
y estudios de mercado por la informacin que ofrecen sobre las orientaciones
y el comportamiento de los consumidores. No ocurre los mismo en el mundo
poltico, donde se reacciona frente a los sondeos de opinin pblica segn
sus resultados. Cuando stos favorecen, las encuestas son un bocado. Por el
contrario, cuando dan en las narices, se acusan los trabajos de sesgados,
muestras mal estructuradas, encuestas no rigurosas o simplemente las ignoran.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Esto ltimo est ocurriendo en Chile. Los polticos sistemticamente han
venido ignorando los diversos sondeos pblicos que reiteradamente reflejan
un creciente desprestigio de la actividad partidaria y desvalorizacin de
las tareas parlamentarias. La suma de pequeos factores han causado la
brecha, cada vez mayor, que separa a los polticos de la ciudadana, de lo
cual ningn partido se escapa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El elemento que quiz ha ayudado ms a construir la mala imagen poltica a
nivel de opinin pblica es la tendencia de los dirigentes de tratar de
aprovechar la infraestructura del Estado para obtener ventajas ms en
beneficio propio que en el de sus representados.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dentro de tal lnea se inscribe el nuevo intento, esta vez propiciado desde
las propias filas del Poder Ejecutivo, de sacar adelante un proyecto de ley
que permita al Estado entregar recursos para que los partidos polticos
financien sus campaas electorales. Es cierto que la cantidad propuesta -12
millones de dlares- parece insignificante, pero ante la opinin pblica
surge como un nuevo intento de escamotear fondos que deben ser destinados a
tareas socialmente ms importantes, como por ejemplo mejorar la situacin de
los pensionados del viejo sistema estatal (unas 500.000 personas reciben
menos de $100 mensuales) y ampliar las oportunidades de educacin y de salud
para los sectores ms desposedos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El argumento de los partidarios del financiamiento pblico de las campaas
electorales es que hay que terminar "con el maridaje obsceno entre el dinero
y la poltica", es decir, la obtencin de financiamiento por vas "oscuras",
ya que en la actualidad la militancia de los partidos es incapaz de
suministrar los fondos necesarios ni siquiera para el mantenimiento del
aparataje mnimo de estos. Otro argumento es que hay que transparentar el
financiamiento de las colectividades polticas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ninguna de esas justificaciones aguantan el ms mnimo anlisis. Para que
los partidos se independicen totalmente del apoyo financiero de sectores
privados, o bien de los organismo oficiales, tendran que recibir del Estado
un aporte financiero superior a los $100 millones. Y tal cantidad generara
un proceso corruptivo al interior de los partidos que los conducira al
descalabro moral y tico, como ocurre en otros pases donde el Estado
financia la poltica. En cuanto a la transparencia, alguien cree
ingenuamente que los partidos polticos van a dar a conocer todas las ayudas
recibidas?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hay que tomar tambin en consideracin otras consecuencias derivadas de
encauzar recursos del Estado a los partidos polticos. La ms relevante es
la monopolizacin de la representacin popular por parte de las actuales
entidades. Qu posibilidades tendran candidaturas independientes en ese
escenario?  Incluso, qu oportunidades encontraran los movimientos nuevos
de insertarse en la poltica?  Sin exagerar, se trata de un camino que
demuestra que los grupos polticos no son amigos de la competencia ni del
libre mercado y prefieren mil veces un esquema oligoplico, donde solamente
puedan participar los ya conocidos o los apadrinados, aun cuando para
obtenerlo deban incurrir en gastos abusivos, financiados a la fuerza por
todos los contribuyentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Es sorprendente la actitud del gobierno de Eduardo Frei, la cual seala que
an no ha comprendido la preocupacin general respecto a que el Estado debe
reducir su nivel de gastos, factor que ha impedido que Chile pueda vivir con
tasas de inflacin bajas, al nivel de las naciones desarrolladas. <&copy;p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Uno de los aspectos ms destacados de los dos
gobiernos de la concertacin centroizquierda que ha tenido Chile en aos
recientes ha sido su reiterada accin en beneficio de los sectores ms
desposedos del pas. Ante estudios que sostenan, a comienzos de los 90,
que el 40% de la poblacin sufra de pobreza, las administraciones de
Patricio Aylwin, primero, y ahora Eduardo Frei (hijo) han desplegado una
importante batera de medidas en todos los campos tras la meta de reducir al
mnimo este problema. Ello ha tenido, como contrapartida un incremento
sustancial de impuestos para financiar programas sociales, lo cual ha
catapultado a Chile a alcanzar uno de los primeros puestos en cuanto a carga
impositiva en Amrica Latina (17% del PIB).<p>
Para sorpresa del gobierno, pese a los grandes esfuerzos redistributivos
desplegados, la distribucin del ingreso en el pas no ha mejorado ni
siquiera una dcima en relacin al panorama advertido al trmino del rgimen
militar, segn el informe de la Comisin Nacional de Justicia y Paz de la
Conferencia Episcopal de Chile. El quintil ms rico de la poblacin sigue
recibiendo 58,1% del ingreso, mientras que el ms pobre apenas recibe 4,6%.
El gobierno chileno no sabe dnde ha fallado ni conoce el monto de las
filtraciones que impiden que los recursos lleguen efectivamente a quienes
estn destinados, los ms pobres.<p>
	En todo caso, la denuncia episcopal sirvi de base para reanimar a los
grupos que reclaman mayores impuestos. Para estos, la realidad demuestra la
injusticia de la actual estructura impositiva del pas y, por lo tanto,
segn ellos se debe acrecentar an ms el aporte de los sectores ms
pudientes y lograr as una ms justa distribucin. Lo que no esperaban estos
sectores es que un estudio efectuado por dos importantes funcionarios de
gobierno, uno de ellos el Subsecretario de Desarrollo Social, revel que no
haba relacin alguna entre la ms pareja distribucin del ingreso y la
proporcin de poblacin en situacin de pobreza. El estudio se aboc a
investigar la situacin de las diversas regiones del pas y determin que en
aquellas regiones donde la distribucin es ms desigual hay un cuadro de
pobreza menor que la detectada donde el panoramas es ms igualitario. Toda
una paradoja que est obligando a replantear el problema de la pobreza y a
comprender que en aquellos lugares donde es permitido que un creciente
nmero de personas se hagan muy ricas, los pobres se vuelven menos pobres.
Como sostiene el Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo, fundacin privada chilena
de estudios pblicos, no se combate la pobreza imponiendo una distribucin
ms igualitaria de los ingresos, con lo cual slo se logra redistribuir
pobreza, lo que por generaciones ha sucedido bajo todos los regmenes
socialistas de la historia, desde Europa oriental hasta Cuba.<p>
	Lo que se espera es que este segundo gobierno de la Concertacin revise sus
mtodos, rechace los viejos mitos socialistas y reconozca lo importante que
es construir un camino que motive y facilite la generacin de riqueza, nico
medio capaz de proporcionar nuevas oportunidades y expectativas a la
poblacin que hoy vive en situacin de pobreza. La experiencia demuestra que
aquellos gobiernos que han colocado en primer plano la erradicacin de la
pobreza a travs de programas del sector pblico siempre acaban con un
balance deplorable en este campo. <p>

<H2>UN NUEVO UNIVERSO MONETARIO</H2>
Richard Rahn*<br>
<p>

WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--Movilizar dinero annimamente, a la velocidad de la luz
y a cualquier sitio del mundo va pronto a ser tan fcil como oprimir algunas
teclas en su computadora. Las autoridades fiscales se sienten retadas y
amenazadas por esa nueva tecnologa y, como era de esperarse, algunos
funcionarios de los departamentos del Tesoro y de Justicia de Estados Unidos
estn proponiendo regulaciones que en esencia obligaran a cada ciudadano o
empresa estadounidense a reportar al gobierno cada ingreso y gasto efectuado
electrnicamente. Ni los nazis ni los soviticos alcanzaron tal nivel de
entremetimiento. Felizmente, muchos en el Congreso estn opuestos a tal
intento de negarnos lo que nos queda de privacidad financiera.<p>
	Estamos en una encrucijada. Mientras los gobiernos ms traten de imponernos
impuestos, regularnos, controlarnos y confiscarnos, mayor es el incentivo
del empresario y del inversionista para marcharse. Las nuevas tecnologas
permitirn hacerlo electrnicamente.<p>
	Las transferencias electrnicas reducen drsticamente el costo de
transacciones y la posibilidad de prdidas. Se adelantan varios
experimentos, uno de ellos en Amsterdam es operado por DigiCash y se llama
E-cash. Individuos podrn mover sus fondos de banco a banco, sin que los
bancos mismos se enteren sobre quin hizo el depsito o de qu pas provino.<p>
	Claro que a la oficina de impuestos no le gusta eso, pero el asunto est
fuera de su control. La gente podr escoger entre dos versiones del futuro.
La primera es la sociedad donde todas sus transacciones pueden ser
monitoreadas por el gobierno. La segunda le permitir escoger cules de sus
transacciones estarn al alcance de ojos curiosos y cules se mantendrn en
el anonimato.<p>
	Funcionarios gubernamentales argumentarn que sistemas annimos benefician
principalmente a los narcotraficantes, lavadores de dinero, terroristas y a
los que no pagan sus impuestos. Los libertarios, por su parte, alertarn del
peligro que presentan los gobiernos con total escrutinio sobre el ciudadano.
Los temores legtimos del gobierno se pueden apaciguar substituyendo el
impuesto sobre la renta con tasas bajas de impuestos a las ventas y
retenciones. De todas maneras, no hay duda que las actuales regulaciones
para acabar con el lavado de dinero estn fracasando y ello no justifica la
imposicin de restricciones adicionales a legtimas transferencias
efectuadas por ciudadanos honestos, en detrimento de nuestras libertades
civiles.<p>
	Esta revolucin electrnica significa que los bancos y otras organizaciones
podrn crear su propio dinero. La definicin de dinero como moneda de curso
legal creado por los gobiernos se volver menos y menos relevante. La
distincin actual entre dinero, bienes, servicios y activos desaparecer a
medida que se hagan intercambiables.<p>
	Los gobiernos no podrn detener esta revolucin porque es mundial y
demasiada gente tiene los conocimientos necesarios. La censura y la
regulacin no funcionarn porque el desarrollo de maneras de evadirlas se
mantendr muy por delante de quienes intentan las restricciones. Por las
mismas razones, los gobiernos totalitarios han dejado de controlar la
informacin porque la nueva tecnologa lo hace imposible de lograr. Los
gobiernos tendrn que admitir que el monopolio de su banco central en la
emisin de monedas desaparecer de la misma manera que los coches tirados
por caballos.<p>
	La batalla por la libertad financiera no est perdida. Para ganarla hay que
involucrarse en la reforma del sistema impositivo, la abolicin del impuesto
sobre la renta y su reemplazo por un sistema que no requiera del constante
escrutinio gubernamental. En la era de pagos cibernrticos no es posible
mantener el actual rgimen de impuestos. <p>

<H2>SER NUEVAMENTE REELECTO</H2>
William Ratliff*<br>
<p>
 

LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- El jefe maoista del norte del Per, Pedro Snchez Flores, fue
recientemente capturado mientras trataba de revivir la "guerra popular" de
Sendero Luminoso, el grupo guerrillero ms sanguinario de la historia
latinoamericana.<p>
	Pero ese movimiento est moribundo y los grupos que sobreviven estn ms
interesados en el narcotrfico que en el trfico de ideas. Esa ha sido una
de las victorias del presidente Alberto Fujimori, capaz de recuperar la
esperanza de la gente a travs de cambios revolucionarios. Hablar hoy del
Per es hablar de Fujimori. Desde que tom las riendas del pas en 1990, ha
acumulado poder en sus propias manos, retando a las lites tradicionales con
una democracia autcrata que es controversial tanto dentro como fuera del pas.<p>
	En 1990, Fujimori hered un pas paralizado no slo por la guerrilla sino
por una total ineptitud en el manejo de la economa, un narcotrfico en auge
y la generalizada desesperacin de la gente. Durante su mandato, la
inflacin se redujo de 7.500% a 10% anual y el crecimiento econmico de los
ltimos tres aos le ha ganado al Per el apodo de "jaguar suramericano" de
parte de un importante banquero internacional.<p>
	En una entrevista en el palacio de gobierno, el presidente me dijo que la
mayora de los estadounidenses no entendan esta revolucin, su efectividad,
durabilidad ni el sustento popular. "Profundas diferencias" surgieron entre
Estados Unidos y el Per luego de 1992 -dijo-, cuando disolvi a un Congreso
elitista que se opona al cambio. Fujimori insiste en que "la gente hoy
quiere accin, no retrica". La mayora es "ms realista, prctica y honesta
que los polticos" que prometen sin cumplir, ganndose el desprecio general.
Fujimori mantiene que el anterior Congreso haba sido elegido bajo un
proceso tan fuertemente controlado por los privilegiados que difcilmente se
poda considerar democrtico. Un nuevo Congreso fue electo en 1995,
controlado por quienes apoyan a Fujimori.<p>
	Las encuestas en junio colocaban la aprobacin de Fujimori en 65% y muchos
quieren que busque de nuevo la reeleccin en el ao 2000. Pero sus crticos
argumentan que al socavar las instituciones tradicionales, el populismo de
Fujimori ha despojado al pas de su base institucional. Para el presidente,
fue ms la obra de polticas discriminatorias y rentistas de las lites
polticas, econmicas, sociales y religiosas -an ms que el evidente
fracaso del gobierno de Alan Garca- lo que en 1990 le entreg un pas ruinas.<p>
	Como segunda generacin de inmigrantes japoneses, Fujimori se identifica
con la ignorada mayora indgena, la cual responde a su mensaje y liderazgo.
El mismo se senta excluido "por razones tnicas", concluyendo que la nica
manera de hacer que el gobierno sirva a la mayora de la gente fue
"conscientemente enfrentando a la mayora marginada contra esa lite". Para
ello, viaja incansablemente a todos los rincones del pas. Los resultados
electorales y las encuestas muestran que sus ms decididos partidarios son
los ms pobres de Lima y del interior del pas. Un reciente informe de Banco
Mundial muestra que esos son exactamente los que ms se han beneficiado bajo.<p>

<h2>
COMO AYUDAR A LOS NIOS 
</h2>

Robert Rector*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Recientemente, el capitolio federal fue el escenario de
la manifestacin organizada por el Fondo de Defensa de los Nios. El
objetivo anunciado era llamar la atencin sobre la situacin de los nios en
este pas, mientras que el propsito no anunciado era lograr el continuo
crecimiento del Estado de Bienestar y criticar a los congresistas reformistas.
<dd>	Mientras que la manifestacin tena toda la razn en llamar la atencin
sobre la situacin de muchos nios estadounidenses, es irnico que los nios
estn sufriendo debido a las polticas apoyadas por los organizadores de la
protesta. Los nios sufren porque el Estado de Bienestar izquierdista ha
destrozado los fundamentos morales de los barrios pobres, derrumbando el
matrimonio, destruyendo la tica de trabajo y dejando una estela de
patologa social.
<dd>	El fracaso de la Guerra contra la Pobreza surge de su premisa falsa, la
creencia de que la pobreza material es el meollo del problema de los nios
de los barrios. Segn este punto de vista, al reducir la pobreza se aumenta
automticamente el bienestar de los nios, logrando su desarrollo. De igual
manera, como la pobreza es la "causa" del crimen, del fracaso escolar, de la
ilegitimidad, de las drogas y de la erosin de la tica del trabajo, el
aumento de la beneficencia pblica reduce no slo la pobreza sino al mismo
tiempo todos los dems problemas sociales. De tal lgica simplista surgi el
esfuerzo durante 30 aos en aumentar los beneficios, expandir la
elegibilidad, crear nuevos programas y aumentar el presupuesto. La
manifestacin del Fondo de Defensa de los Nios repiti toda esta vieja
cantaleta.
<dd>	Pero la historia impugna esa ingenua creencia. En 1950, casi una tercera
parte de la poblacin de Estados Unidos era pobre (el doble de la tasa
actual). En 1920, ms o menos la mitad de la poblacin era pobre segn el
estndar actual. Si fuera verdad que la pobreza material es la causa de los
problemas sociales, debiramos haber tenido problemas muchos ms graves en
esas pocas que ahora, cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario: el crimen,
la disolucin de la familia y la mayora de los dems problemas sociales no
eran la sombra de los que confrontamos hoy.
<dd>	Tanto la historia como el sentido comn indican que los valores y las
habilidades existentes en las familias y no sus ingresos son los que
determinan el rendimiento de los nios. Las familias exitosas tienden a
tener valores slidos en cuanto al autocontrol, postergar placeres, trabajo,
educacin y matrimonio, todo lo cual traspasan a sus hijos. El intento de
aumentar artificialmente el ingreso familiar beneficia muy poco a los nios,
pero va lejos en su destruccin de los mismos valores que son claves para el
xito. El punto que la izquierda rehusa reconocer es que la beneficencia
pblica tiene efectos secundarios: engendra dependencia e ilegitimidad que
son nefastos para el desarrollo de los nios. Por ejemplo, entre las casi 5
millones de familias que reciben beneficios, el tiempo que estn bajo esos
programas promedia casi 13 aos. Segn el informe en 1994 de June O'Neill,
la directora de la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, aumentar el lapso en
que un nio recibe beneficencia pblica puede reducir su inteligencia en
20%. O'Neill deja muy claro que es la dependencia de la beneficencia y no la
pobreza lo que realmente hace dao a los nios.
<dd>	Al pagar ms a las mujeres para que tengan ms hijos fuera del matrimonio,
la beneficencia pblica juega un papel importante en la promocin de la
ilegitimidad. Nacer fuera del matrimonio y crecer en un hogar con una madre
soltera triplica los problemas emocionales y de comportamiento entre los
nios, a la vez que tambin triplica su actividad sexual, dobla la
probabilidad de que las nias tengan hijos fuera del matrimonio y que los
nios incurran en actividades delictivas que los har terminar en la crcel.
<dd>	No es posible ayudar a los nios persistiendo en polticas equivocadas. El
sistema actual de beneficencia pblica tiene que ser reemplazado y hay que
terminar con el crecimiento automtico de los gastos en beneficencia. La
beneficencia no puede continuar siendo una calle de una sola va; los
beneficiarios tienen que trabajar para recibir la ayuda. Hay que reducir la
ilegitimidad restringiendo las ddivas en efectivo a las muchachas solteras
con hijos.
<dd>	Las instituciones religiosas han sido dramticamente exitosas en reducir la
actividad sexual de los jvenes, el delito, las drogas y dems problemas.
Una manera de darle acceso a los pobres a tales fuentes de esperanza es a
travs de vales que puedan ser utilizados por las familias pobres para
mandar a sus hijos a escuelas privadas, incluyendo escuelas religiosas.
<dd>	Pero la ciudadana debe recordar que el bien intencionado gobierno grande
que quiere mantener una izquierda que apoda a los reformistas como
"anti-nios" est promocionando justamente todo aquello que daa a nuestra
juventud: la beneficencia pblica.&copy

<h2>
LA CRISIS DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>     
     
     
Paul Craig Roberts*
<p>

WASHINTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Si los ciudadanos y sus representantes en el gobierno no
encaran la situacin del Seguro Social, no habr futuro para los
pensionados. El Seguro Social siempre ha sido una pirmide fraudulenta y se
est desmoronando.
<dd>	El Seguro Social "funcion" durante medio siglo por dos razones bsicas: el
programa se origin cuando la poblacin trabajadora era muy grande en
proporcin al nmero de retirados cobrando beneficios y los impuestos a la
nmina necesarios para financiar esos beneficios eran bajos.
<dd>	Al pasar el tiempo, la longevidad ha aumentado y la tasa de nacimiento se
ha reducido. La poblacin en general se torn ms vieja y la proporcin de
trabajadores a pensionados se ha reducido. Para compensar todo esto, el
impuesto a la nmina ha ido aumentando hasta alcanzar 15,3%. Y para mantener
la pirmide ese impuesto tendra que ser doblado para el ao 2040. Varios
factores hacen eso imposible.
<dd>	Sera un peso impositivo imposible de aguantar y aadido al impuesto sobre
la renta y a otros impuestos no le dejaran gran cosa a las familias para
vivir. Otro factor es el impacto sobre el nivel de empleo. Los impuestos a
la nmina son impuestos al empleo. En el pasado, la combinacin de alta
productividad, falta de competencia extranjera e impuestos a la nmina
relativamente bajos impidi que muchos estadounidenses perdieran sus
trabajos, pero la situacin de hoy es diferente. Los impuestos ahora son
altos, la productividad ya no es tan superior a la de otros pases y la
competencia extranjera ha crecido con la desaparicin del socialismo.
<dd>	A partir del ao 2012, el Seguro Social no podr pagar los beneficios
prometidos a menos que el gobierno cubra el dficit pidiendo prestado. Pero
igual como hay un lmite a los impuestos a la nmina, existe tambin un
lmite a la habilidad del gobierno para endeudarse y pagar as los
beneficios del Seguro Social. El dficit se disparara y prestarle
crecientes cantidades al gobierno sera visto como una mala y arriesgada
inversin.
<dd>	Pero la mayor barrera contra la continuacin del actual sistema piramidal
del Seguro Social es la necesidad que tiene la economa de Estados Unidos de
nuevas inversiones para mantener su posicin competitiva en el mundo. Un
verdadero sistema de pensiones aporta los fondos que le permiten a la
economa crecer, pero nuestro Seguro Social es un sistema de transferencias
diseado para cubrir los gastos de vida y hospitalizacin de los mayores.
<dd>	Hay una sola manera de prevenir el colapso del Seguro Social y esa es
convertirlo en un verdadero sistema de jubilacin. El monto proveniente del
impuesto a la nmina sera invertido en un fondo de pensiones a nombre de
cada trabajador. Esto le dara seguridad al trabajador y aportara a la
economa los fondos requeridos para inversin.
<dd>	La transicin sera difcil, pero se puede hacer si comenzamos ahora. La
transicin tendra que ser financiada con un supervit fiscal para pagar los
beneficios de aquellos que se acercan a la edad de jubilacin y cuyo dinero
fue utilizado para pagar a otros que se retiraron antes.
<dd>	El gobierno nos ha venido engaando. Nos promete una jubilacin a cambio de
un impuesto de 15,3% a la nmina, pero no puede cumplir. A menos que se
privatice el sistema, la poblacin va a quedarse con altos impuestos y sin
ningn beneficio. &copy;

TELARAAS MINISTERIALES
</H2>
Paul Craig Roberts*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Las renuncias masivas en el gabinete del presidente
Clinton nos permiten pensar que las polticas de su segunda administracin
pueden ser ms equilibradas, pero para que ello se logre tendrn que haber
tambin muchos cambios burocrticos por debajo del nivel ministerial.
<P>
 Los ministros reciben toda la atencin pblica, pero el poder operativo
est en manos de sus asistentes, entre quienes han proliferado los
extremistas que piensan que los valores e instituciones de Estados Unidos
son discriminatorios y deben ser reformados.
<P>
 Los burcratas nombrados por Clinton ven discriminacin racial y sexual en
todos los rincones de nuestra sociedad. La encuentran en la institucin del
matrimonio, en los valores religiosos tradicionales, en primas de seguros y
en las tasas de intereses hipotecarios basadas en  los riesgos, en academias
militares fundadas hace 157 aos y en el comportamiento normal de los nios.
<P>
 Recuerda el caso del nio de seis aos que fue suspendido por "acoso
sexual" al haber besado en la mejilla a una niita? Fue el resultado de
regulaciones emitidas por Norma Cantu, vice ministra de Educacin para
derechos civiles. Otro logro de la Sra. Cantu es la imposicin de "equidad
sexual" para destruir muchos programas de atletismo masculino en las
universidades. La Sra. Cantu exige un "equilibrio de gnero" en los
programas deportivos y como las mujeres no juegan ftbol americano, otros
deportes han tenido que ser eliminados para mantener la representacin
proporcional entre varones y hembras.
<P>
 La Sra. Nan Hunter, consultora jurdica asistente del Departamento de Salud
y Servicios Humanos, antes diriga el programa de Derechos de Lesbianas y
'Gays' de la Unin Americana de Libertades Civiles. Ella considera al
matrimonio como otra institucin discriminatoria ms y busca eliminar "la
estructura de gnero en todo matrimonio".
<P>
 Deval Patrick, vice ministro de Justicia para derechos humanos, ha abusado
de su cargo en tal forma que fue denunciado por la senadora demcrata de
Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, por sus "tcnicas tipo Gestapo", aplastando a
ciudadanos y comunidades. Patrick inici una demanda de discriminacin
contra un banco en Chevy Chase, Maryland, obligando al banco a travs de una
campaa de prensa, protestas y manifestaciones de grupos interesados a
conceder prstamos con intereses por debajo de sus costos a "minoras" y a
establecer sucursales segn criterios raciales.
<P>
 Cuando los ciudadanos del pueblo de Bakersfield, California, se opusieron a
la instalacin de una casa para enfermos mentales en su barrio residencial,
Patrick los denunci por discriminacin e inici un juicio federal contra
ellos, sabiendo perfectamente que el bolsillo del gobierno federal es mucho
ms profundo que el de esa pobre gente que defiende su barrio. La alcalde de
San Diego declar ante una comisin del Senado que sufrir los ataques de
Patrick es como vivir en la antigua Unin Sovitica. 
<P>
 Fue Patrick quien logr destruir la tradicin de las academias militares
Citadel y Virginia Military Institute, fundadas en 1842 y 1839, obligndolas
a cambiar su cultura y a aceptar mujeres. Patrick predica a abogados tanto
dentro como fuera del gobierno que los derechos de "las minoras preferidas"
estn por encima de los derechos constitucionales de los que no han sido
designados como minoras.
<P>
 Patrick renunci y busca un trabajo mejor remunerado. Buena suerte. Pero el
Senado republicano tiene que hacer un mejor trabajo esta vez, rechazando
nombramientos de payasos estrafalarios a cargos claves de la administracin.

<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El nuevo gobierno espaol, elegido en marzo en reemplazo
de los socialistas que ocuparon el poder por 14 aos y dejaron la economa
en estado catico, se apresura a cumplir con las estipulaciones de la moneda
nica europea. Estos requisitos, que los pases de la Unin Europea deben
cumplir para finales de 1997 para poder ingresar como miembros fundadores de
la Unin Monetaria Europea (UME), exigen que la deuda pblica no sobrepase
el 60% del PIB, que el dficit fiscal no pase del 3% del PIB y que la tasa
de inflacin no sea ms que punto y medio superior a las tasas ms bajas de
los pases miembros.
<P>Con una deuda pblica equivalente al 65% del PIB, un dficit fiscal
estimado este ao en 4% del PIB y una tasa de inflacin de medio punto por
encima del objetivo, las posibilidades son buenas de que Espaa cumpla. Sin
embargo, tratar simplemente de remendar el Estado de Bienestar no es una
alternativa viable, ya que dejara a Espaa en desventaja competitiva frente
a sus socios europeos. Por el contrario, el nuevo gobierno debe instrumentar
reformas de mercado que fomenten el crecimiento econmico, aumenten la tasa
de empleo y atraigan de nuevo la inversin extranjera.
<P>Lamentablemente, los polticos espaoles estn poniendo demasiado nfasis
en alcanzar los requisitos de la UME, en vez de enfrentar los defectos
estructurales de la economa que condujeron a una tasa de desempleo del
22,4%.  Por ejemplo, en vez de eliminar programas pblicos costosos e
innecesarios, el gobierno est tratando de reducir el dficit a 3%
congelando los salarios de los funcionarios pblicos. Tales "soluciones"
pueden lograr que Espaa entre precariamente en la UME a finales de 1997,
pero el nuevo presidente del gobierno, Jos Mara Aznar, debera ms bien
reducir substancialmente el papel del Estado en la economa.
<P>Algunos pasos se han dado, incluyendo gestiones para privatizar algunas
empresas estatales. Pero hay que ir ms lejos porque el Estado de Bienestar
espaol ha fracasado miserablemente. Aznar deber afrontar con coraje la
crisis antes que ese Estado de Bienestar colapse por su propio peso. 
<P>Hay que reformar el sistema pblico de pensiones, liberalizar el mercado
laboral y simplificar el cdigo fiscal. El actual sistema de pensiones
consume cerca del 10% del PIB y va camino a la quiebra. Si las pensiones se
mantienen a los actuales niveles, ellas de por s producirn un dficit
equivalente al 4% del PIB para el ao 2025. Y, dadas las tendencias
demogrficas de Espaa, reducir los beneficios de los actuales o futuros
pensionistas o aumentar las cotizaciones de los trabajadores (actualmente
28% de la nmina) no evitar la quiebra. Esta es la conclusin de un estudio
recientemente publicado por el Crculo de Empresarios.  
<P>Ese estudio muestra que tanto los trabajadores como los empresarios se
beneficiaran con la instrumentacin de un sistema de capitalizacin
individual, fiscalmente viable y similar al exitoso sistema chileno.  Pero
el Sr. Aznar ha declarado que cualquier reforma de las pensiones se har
dentro del marco del actual sistema pblico de reparto.
<P>Si la crisis del sistema de pensiones comienza ahora a hacerse evidente, la
crisis en el mercado laboral ha plagado a Espaa durante aos.  Espaa tiene
la tasa de desempleo ms alta del mundo industrializado. Las amplias
regulaciones estatales diseadas para ayudar a los trabajadores y a los que
buscan empleos han resultado contraproducentes. Costosas leyes sobre
despidos y vacaciones han aumentado exageradamente el costo de la mano de
obra y disminuido la tasa de empleo fijo.
<P>Tambin falta que la nueva administracin fije una poltica fiscal clara.
El reemplazo de la tasa mxima del impuesto sobre ganancias de capital de
56% por una nica del 20% fue seguida por aumentos de impuestos al tabaco y
bebidas alcohlicas, y  se esperan aumentos al agua y las medicinas.
<P>No se ha adelantado en las promesas electorales de reformar el cdigo
fiscal. Ms bien, el gobierno ha tratado de extraer ms fondos del sector
privado combatiendo la evasin de impuestos. Habra mayor cumplimiento si la
estructura del cdigo fiscal, que tiene 17 tramos, se simplificase y si la
tasa marginal del 56% fuera reducida.
<P>Si bien es cierto que la UME ofrece beneficios, hoy la economa espaola no
est en posicin de disfrutarlos y probablemente tampoco lo estar a finales
de 1997. El nuevo gobierno servir mejor al pueblo espaol si adopta
reformas de mercado, en lugar de tratar de salvar a un sistema
socioeconmico fracasado. Los espaoles eligieron a Aznar porque estaban
cansados de la corrupcin causada por la poltica estatista e
intervencionista del gobierno de Felipe Gonzlez. Solamente un golpe de
timn permitir a Espaa satisfacer las aspiraciones de sus ciudadanos.

EL NUEVO PROTECCIONISMO DE ESTADOS UNIDOS

<p>
WAHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- En la cumbre de la Organizacin Mundial del Comercio
(OMC) que se celebra actualmente en Singapur, los Estados Unidos y otras
naciones industrializadas estn insistiendo en la "armonizacin" de
regulaciones laborales con los pases en desarrollo, como condicin para
cualquier futuro acuerdo de libre comercio. Los pases en vas de
desarrollo, incluyendo los Tigres Asiticos, se oponen.
<P>
 El establecimiento de normas laborales mnimas a nivel mundial es parte del
esfuerzo por crear una serie de preceptos comerciales supuestamente justos,
con el fin de "nivelar el campo de juego". Con tales normas, los lderes
sindicales y otros grupos de presin de las naciones industrializadas
intentan que los trabajadores de los pases ricos sean menos vulnerables a
la competencia de la mano de obra barata extranjera.
<P>
 Pero, en el fondo, esto no es ms que una nueva forma de proteccionismo. Y
el proteccionismo, al igual que el mono, aunque se vista de seda,
proteccionismo se queda. La vulnerabilidad de los trabajadores en los pases
industrializados no se debe al mayor volumen de comercio con los pases en
vas de desarrollo sino a polticas macroeconmicas errneas. Por ejemplo,
en Europa Occidental el seguro de desempleo es demasiado generoso,
aumentando los costos laborales de tal manera que la tasa de contratacin
permanente es muy baja.
<P>
 La nocin del comercio "justo" implica una igualdad de resultados, es
decir, una balanza comercial equilibrada. Pero son los individuos, no las
naciones, los que comercian entre s. Y la razn por la que intercambian
bienes y servicios es que esperan beneficiarse del intercambio. Un criterio
ms apropiado sera determinar si las reglas comerciales (que no es lo mismo
que las regulaciones laborales) se pueden aplicar con igualdad y de manera
general a todos aquellos que comercian.  Es ms, ste sera un rol legtimo
de la OMC.
<P>
 La famosa clusula social, que impondra unos derechos laborales mnimos,
elevara el costo laboral de los trabajadores en los pases en desarrollo
muy por encima del rendimiento de su trabajo, creando automticamente un
desempleo generalizado. Como explica la economista guatemalteca Lucy
Martnez-Mont: "El privar a los pases en vas de desarrollo, incluso con
las mejores intenciones, del capital y del empleo necesarios para erradicar
las condiciones de pobreza que nos afligen desde hace siglos solamente
asegurar la perpetuacin indefinida de dicha miseria."
<P>
 Una de las claves para salir de la pobreza es la apertura de los mercados y
a medida que el nivel de vida sube, los trabajadores son capaces de
satisfacer otros deseos menos importantes que el mnimo sustento, como son
mejores condiciones de trabajo y un medio ambiente ms limpio. Nada de eso
se logra por medio de decretos supranacionales.
<P>
 La agenda estadounidense en la OMC es especialmente peligrosa para los
pases en vas de desarrollo porque de lograr imponer la clusula social en
las reglas multilaterales del comercio se paralizaran los avances de los
pases pobres, adems de perjudicar gravemente a los consumidores de todo el
mundo.
<P>
 La libertad de los individuos de disponer de su propiedad como les plazca y
de participar en intercambios voluntarios con otros individuos -ya sean
estos de la misma ciudad o de otro pas- es una caracterstica fundamental
del sistema de libre empresa. Los excesos regulatorios que han conducido al
estancamiento econmico y a una mayor dependencia del Estado en muchas
naciones industrializadas son una restriccin de esa libertad y una
imposicin que los pases en vas de desarrollo no necesitan para nada.

<h2>
VENEZUELA: CRONICA DE DOS AJUSTES
</h2>
Carlos Sabino*
<p>
CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los llamados "paquetes de ajuste" en Venezuela tienden a
parecerse mucho, como dos gotas de agua. Ello ocurre por motivos bastante
definidos. Los dos programas de ajuste econmico -el que comenz Carlos
Andrs Prez en febrero de 1989 y tuvo que detener tres aos despus, y el
que se inici hace un mes bajo la presidencia de Rafael Caldera- se han
encaminado a resolver problemas fiscales y cambiarios apremiantes, que ya no
admitan dilacin. Prez se encontr con un rgimen cambiario controlado que
generaba una disparidad enorme entre el precio del dlar oficial y el que se
transaba libremente, en tanto que Caldera volvi a imponer el control de
cambios para darse cuenta, ao y medio despus, que le resultaba imposible
sostenerlo; tanto en 1989 como en 1996 las arcas fiscales estaban
prcticamente agotadas y no haba recursos para cumplir con los compromisos
ms inmediatos del estado. En ambas ocasiones se han presentado amplios
"programas sociales" que, bien mirados, no son sino simples transferencias
indiscriminadas de dinero para reducir los costos polticos de quienes toman
las medidas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No extraar por ello que ambos liberaran el mercado cambiario y que se
hayan levantado algunos subsidios que resultaba imposible mantener, como el
de la gasolina, por ejemplo. No hay en esto ninguna propuesta ideolgica de
fondo, ningn modelo de sociedad que se trate de desarrollar. Cuando las
cuentas no salen es preciso reducir los gastos, aumentar los ingresos o
combinar de alguna manera ambas cosas. Se trata de una vieja receta conocida
desde el tiempo de los fenicios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este tipo de ajustes, importantes y necesarios como puedan ser, no bastan
sin embargo para definir una poltica econmica de largo plazo, pues se
dirigen simplemente a resolver el problema coyuntural. Detrs de ste,
escondidas a la vista del observador superficial, se encuentran las
verdaderas causas que llevan a los pases a situaciones de "desajuste" que
luego se hace imperioso remediar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En Venezuela, estas causas tienen directa relacin con el papel asfixiante
que tiene el estado frente a la sociedad civil. Este no slo posee el
petrleo y otras industrias fundamentales (acero, aluminio, electricidad,
etc.), as como una buena proporcin de todos los terrenos existentes, sino
que emplea al 20% de la poblacin activa total, regula y controla toda
actividad imaginable y se caracteriza por una ineficiencia descomunal.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Modificar esta maquinaria poderosa, pero incapaz de una accin efectiva, es
la tarea central que tiene la sociedad venezolana. No se trata entonces de
aumentar los impuestos, pues si bien con ello se mejoran las cuentas
fiscales se siguen ahogando y contrayendo las actividades productivas, ni de
vender algunas empresas pblicas que estn quebradas o dan prdidas. Se
trata de emprender un verdadero cambio estructural, de privatizar todo
aquello que puede ser gestionado eficientemente por los particulares, de
modificar la arbitraria legislacin que tenemos, de reducir drsticamente el
tamao de la burocracia pblica.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Si esto no se realiza volveremos, en poco tiempo, a una situacin parecida
a la que tenamos hace un mes: el estado gastar los nuevos recursos que
reciba, volver a endeudarse y sus cuentas, finalmente, se desequilibrarn
otra vez. De nuevo habr que emprender un ajuste, devaluar, subir los
precios de los servicios pblicos y aumentar los impuestos, empobreciendo
an ms a la sufrida sociedad venezolana.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Venezuela, otra vez, como hace siete aos, est soportando la inflacin y
la recesin que producen estos ajustes. El sacrificio de nada servir, como
no sirvi en la ocasin anterior, si no se avanza una modificacin
estructural de la economa del pas. <p>&copy;

<h2>
SE CAE LA PRIVATIZACIN EN MEXICO
</h2>     
     
     
Roberto Salinas-Len*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- La polmica sobre la privatizacin de la
petroqumica mexicana se ha polarizado entre aquellos que celebran el
monopolio estatal de la industria petrolera como smbolo de soberana
nacional y los que reclaman nuevas estrategias para capitalizar y modernizar
uno de los sectores ms atrasados, pero con mayor potencial de crecimiento
en la economa mexicana.
<dd>	Este es otro de tantos dramas que ha sufrido nuestra economa desde el
estallido de la crisis financiera. La privatizacin es una forma de aumentar
la productividad de las empresas, de permitir que el gobierno elimine
derroches presupuestales y se logren atraer nuevas inversiones de capital
productivo. Sin embargo, la mayora de los mexicanos ven la privatizacin
con malos ojos, ms como un instrumento de amiguismo para privilegiar a unos
pocos a costa de un pueblo desesperado y empobrecido.
<dd>	Por otra parte, la ciudadana percibe que la llamada soberana nacional se
manipula a conveniencia,  para que lderes corporativistas y sindicales
mantengan su poder personal, ya que lo que se anuncia como propiedad de "la
Nacin" no es en realidad propiedad de nadie. Los grupos de oposicin
(sindicatos, intelectuales de izquierda, representantes de la burocracia
mexicana) proponen realizar un referndum sobre si se debe privatizar o no
las plantas petroqumicas. Pero ms que un referndum lo que se necesita es
ampliar la propiedad de esas empresas entre numerosas personas y grupos. As
se ha hecho con xito en pases como Chile, Inglaterra y la Repblica Checa,
donde la venta de empresas a los trabajadores y entre las clases ms
humildes produjo un fuerte apoyo a la iniciativa privatizadora.
<dd>	Es desafortunado que el debate se haya centrado sobre si se debe privatizar
la petroqumica o no, en vez de cmo se debe realizar una necesaria
privatizacin. La realidad es que las empresas llamadas "privadas" tienden a
ser ms pblicas que las empresas "pblicas", las cuales tienden a estar
bajo el frreo control y funcionar para beneficio de burcratas y polticos.
La industria petrolera mexicana es un triste ejemplo de todo esto.
<dd>	Claro que si la privatizacin se concibe como PRI-vatizacin, es decir,
como medio para fortalecer el esquema mercantilista mexicano, donde el
precio y los ingresos para el fisco son las principales prioridades, como
sucedi con la privatizacin de la banca, entonces el referndum debera dar
un voto negativo. Pero sera muy diferente si la privatizacin abarca un fin
popular, de privatizar la propiedad de la petroqumica entre el ms amplio
sector posible.
<dd>	En realidad, el fiel cumplimiento de una privatizacin bien estructurada es
ms importante que el precio en s de la venta. Es fundamental usar la
privatizacin como medio de acceso universal a la propiedad, preferiblemente
por un nmero significativo de nuevos accionistas. En Mxico, la motivacindel proceso no es popular ni mucho menos de aumentar la tenencia de
propiedad entre un creciente sector ajeno a los corredores del poder
gubernamental. Se habla, ms bien, de la "reestructuracin" del sector
pblico y de la "racionalizacin de la participacin estatal en la economa".
<dd>	El esquema que se pretende usar en el caso de la petroqumica no respeta la
necesidad de diversificar la estructura accionaria de las empresas entre la
poblacin y la falta de apoyo oblig al gobierno zedillista a revocar la
participacin de empresas extranjeras, aun cuando estas son las que podran
contribuir ms a la modernizacin del sector petroqumico. Ello signific un
triunfo parcial para los antagonistas jursicos del falso nacionalismo que
tanto dao le han hecho a Mxico. &copy;

<h2>
GUERRILLA COLOMBIANA JUEGA AL ANTISAMPERISMO
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Enrique Santos Caldern
</a>

<P>
BOGOTA (AIPE).- La guerrilla colombiana haba estado sospechosamente
quieta. A lo mejor pensaba que atacar a Samper era hacerle el juego a los
gringos. O que si cayera este Gobierno se subiran los militares.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero ya no parece tener esas dudas. La masacre de los 11 policas en el
pueblo de Chaln mediante la utilizacin de un "burro-bomba" (lo nico que
faltaba), marc el inicio de una ofensiva que continu el "paro armado", con
su trgico saldo de 25 muertos, buses y camiones incendiados, oleoductos
volados, puentes destruidos... 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Segn un panfleto del ELN, el objetivo es presionar la salida del
presidente Samper, lo que indica que la guerrilla ya reconoce el acelerado
desprestigio del Gobierno y procura sacar dividendos polticos enarbolando
tambin la bandera del antisamperismo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero, no gracias. El pas deliberante, que entiende la necesidad del
retiro del presidente, no acepta estos mtodos, ni requiere a estos aliados.
Entre otras cosas porque el antisamperismo de la subversin es producto del
oportunismo de pescar en ro revuelto, y no de una conviccin sobre las
razones de ndole tica y poltica que precipitaron esta crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla se encontr con una coyuntura que ahora piensa puede
resultarle favorable. No la busc, ni la propici, y casi ni la entiende. Le
peg tan de frente, a pesar de ella. Otra muestra de como no logra
conectarse con el pas real. Para la subversin todos los gobiernos son
iguales. No diferencia, ni matiza. No le interesa la reforma, sino la
destruccin del sistema. Por eso no puede contribuir a la solucin de la
crisis ni aprovechar siquiera una coyuntura que debera serles muy propicia
a quienes invocan la lucha contra la corrupcin, la opresin y la injusticia
para justificar actos violentos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;En efecto, con un gobierno desprestigiado y acorralado, sin credibilidad
interna ni externa, y sin recursos ya para el populismo social; sin una
oposicin que est en condiciones de movilizar a la gente o convertirse en
alternativa creble, era de suponer que quienes llevan 30 aos luchando con
las armas dizque por un pas mejor fueran por lo menos capaces de formular
una propuesta realista.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pero, qu va. La crisis no ha sido sino nueva oportunidad para reafirmar su
vocacin violenta y su naturaleza destructiva; para comprobar su grado de
despolitizacin y bandolerizacin; para seguir haciendo, en fin, lo que
mejor hacen: matar, secuestrar, dinamitar. Ya no parece interesarles nada
ms: ni el poder, ni el bienestar popular, ni los intereses nacionales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla sigue manejando, claro, un discurso poltico. Ejerce control
sobre amplias zonas del territorio nacional donde el Estado brilla por su
ausencia. Y tiene la base social que le ofrecen la marginalidad y pobreza de
una poblacin que nada tiene que perder. Y es que para un jornalero del
campo o un marginado urbano ingresar a la subversin puede significar
incluso una mejora en sus condiciones de vida.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Mientras no cambien estas circunstancias objetivas, la guerrilla tendr
siempre carne de can para alimentar sus filas. Y podr camuflar la
impresionante perversin de sus ideales invocando motivos sociales y causas
patriticas. Lo grave es que la situacin del pas, la parlisis del
Gobierno el agotamiento del presupuesto social, el deterioro de la economa
y dems signos de la crisis, indican que, lejos de mejorar, estas
condiciones pueden empeorar.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla ya lo sabe y por eso promovi un "paro armado". Que fue una
forma de medir su fuerza y la del gobierno. Y si bien su poder de
convocatoria result escaso, porque carece de credibilidad poltica, si
demostr su poder de intimidacin en muchas regiones del pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo del paro representa un audaz paso en su estrategia de confrontacin
total. Consciente de la debilidad del Gobierno, la subversin quiere ampliar
el escenario de la guerra. Y todo indica que es lo que puede suceder. Basta
ver cmo los grupos de autodefensa tambin se multiplican y anuncian que van
a incrementar sus acciones contra la guerrilla.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin capacidad de liderazgo en la cpula del Estado; sin estrategia de
guerra ni poltica de paz, y con unas Fuerzas Armadas afectadas tambin por
el recorte presupuestal, no es nada halagador el panorama que se vislumbra
en materia de orden pblico en Colombia.

<H2>EL GRAN GOBIERNO EN RETROCESO</H2>
Chris Sarlo*<br>
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Se nota la tendencia hacia menos regulaciones y
gobiernos ms pequeos. Aunque el tamao y alcance del gobierno tienden a
subir y bajar, lo que Robert Nozick llama "el zigzagueo de la poltica",
podemos decir que una contraccin gubernamental permanente se lleva adelante
en Canad, Estados Unidos, partes de Europa, en el sur de Asia, Nueva
Zelanda y, ms recientemente, en Israel.<p>
	Parecen haber tres razones fundamentales en la reduccin del tamao del
estado: filosfica, econmica y pragmtica. Filosficamente se puede
argumentar que una vez dejado atrs los eufemismos, el estado es bsicamente
un instrumento coercitivo que restringe la libertad individual y la
creatividad. En trminos econmicos, el caso es que la intervencin
gubernamental reduce la eficiencia de la economa, lo cual resulta en menos
empleos y un nivel de vida ms bajo. La razn pragmtica es sencilla: una
inmensa deuda pblica y la inconveniencia poltica de aumentar los impuestos
significa que el gobierno tiene que recortar sus gastos. En Canad predomina
esta ltima razn. La deuda obliga a reducir el tamao del estado.<p>0
	Cualquiera que sea la motivacin, la contraccin del estado se puede hacer
bien o mal. Un ejemplo de lo ltimo es la llamada poltica de "contrato
social", donde se tratan de reducir gastos sin reducir el nmero de
funcionarios pblicos. Ese camino confronta graves problemas. Primero, parte
de la causa de la deuda pblica es que el gobierno es demasiado grande, hay
demasiada gente trabajando en el sector pblico. Se llega a esa situacin
por creer que no hay problema que no pueda ser resuelto con la creacin de
una nueva agencia, comisin o superintendencia.<p>
	En estos asuntos hay que preguntarse si lo que queremos que el gobierno
haga por nosotros lo podemos nosotros mismos hacer mejor. Acaso en este o
aquel campo el mercado y los arreglos particulares de la gente pueden
producir mejores resultados que la accin estatal? De ser as, tenemos que
resistir la tentacin de pedir que el gobierno lo haga. Todas las sociedades
deben hacerse peridicamente esta pregunta clave.<p>
	Probablemente habr un consenso sobre las principales funciones del estado,
respecto a las funciones de la polica, justicia y defensa nacional. Habr
tambin consenso sobre exclusiones. En Canad, por ejemplo, cada da hay ms
oposicin a que el gobierno confiera subsidios a empresas privadas,
incluyendo la agricultura. Y el financiamiento gubernamental de grupos de
presin es cada da ms criticado. Tambin es ahora polticamente posible la
privatizacin de servicios pblicos como el correo y el sistema de pensiones
del Seguro Social.<p>
	El verdadero debate surge en las reas de salud, beneficencia, regulacin y
ayuda extranjera. Mientras no est clara la necesidad de tener monopolios
estatales en esas reas, no ser fcil combatir los argumentos en favor de
la intervencin estatal. Lo que s sabemos es que los adelantos tecnolgicos
hacen cada da ms viable la privatizacin y la eliminacin de regulaciones.<p>
	Una vez que hayamos decidido cul es el papel apropiado para el gobierno,
hay que eliminar todas las dems funciones que no se justifican. Claro que
hay que proceder con compasin y ello incluye campaas de entrenamiento de
empleados pblicos para que se puedan ganar la vida en otras actividades.<p>
	La reconsideracin peridica del papel del estado, con el propsito de ir
pasando funciones al sector privado que ste pueda llevar a cabo con mayor
eficiencia, es algo esencial para todas las naciones que quieran evitar los
costosos errores del pasado. <p>

<h2>
UN DEPARTAMENTO DE ESTADO VERDE
</h2>     
     
     
James H. Sheehan*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El secretario de Estado Warren Christopher ha declarado
la proteccin mundial del medio ambiente como principio fundamental de la
poltica exterior de Estados Unidos. En discursos recientes, el Sr.
Christopher anunci la "Iniciativa Ambiental para el siglo XXI", como agenda
ambiciosa de las iniciativas diplomticas verdes que tiene la intencin de
promover con renovado vigor por todo el mundo.
<dd>	Esta poltica ha sido "considerablemente influenciada" por el
vicepresidente Al Gore, de donde provienen muchas de las iniciativas
ambientales de la administracin Clinton. Tal influencia comenz con el
nombramiento de Tim Wirth al cargo de subsecretario de Estado para asuntos
mundiales. Ms recientemente, Christopher orden el comienzo de la promocin
de una ideologa amistosa hacia la Tierra por parte del Departamento de
Estado. Y en marzo hizo un peregrinaje a Brasil para demostrar su compromiso
con los bosques tropicales.
<dd>	La administracin Clinton est usando el medio ambiente como tema para
atacar al Congreso Republicano y sus abortados planes de reformar la
poltica ambiental y de recortar el presupuesto en esta rea. Creyendo que
el ambientalismo es un buen tema electoral, Christopher ha propuesto
restricciones internacionales a los bosques, ocanos y al uso de materias
qumicas. Los activistas ambientales aplauden estas propuestas como un muy
esperado adelanto. Pero no van a ser muy populares entre el pblico. Muchos
estadounidenses se voltearon contra Clinton en las ltimas elecciones
parlamentarias porque medidas excesivas de este tipo daan la economa y
devalan sus propiedades. La terca insistencia en este tema muestra la
inconexin del gobierno con el votante comn.
<dd>	Mientras los estadounidenses han sealado sus deseos de menores impuestos y
un gobierno ms pequeo, el Departamento de Estado exige ms dinero para ser
gastado en programas burocrticos de las Naciones Unidas y del Banco
Mundial. Los estadounidenses no quieren gastar el dinero de sus impuestos
para sostener a gobiernos extranjeros ni para subsidiar a las grandes
corporaciones.
<dd>	Luego de un invierno congelado, el Departamento de Estado apoya
restricciones a la utilizacin de energa a travs del Tratado de las
Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climtico. Se estima que las propuestas del
Departamento de Estado para regular el uso de combustibles como el petrleo
y el carbn costarn 600.000 puestos de trabajo y aadirn un dlar al
precio de cada galn de gasolina. La protesta pblica por el costo de la
gasolina recientemente llev al Congreso a tratar de rebajar los impuestos
aumentados por Clinton. Si la utilizacin de combustibles contribuye al
efecto invernadero, entonces el viento polar que sopla sobre Estados Unidos
durante el invierno debiera ser menos fro en vez de ms fro.
<dd>	El Departamento de Estado quiere que el Senado ratifique el Tratado de
Biodiversidad, que contiene clusulas sobre inventarios nacionales de la
flora y la fauna, reviviendo viejas propuestas de planificacin central por
parte de los gobiernos sobre el uso de la tierra. Adems de imponer onerosas
regulaciones a la biotecnologa, la ratificacin del Senado obligara a los
contribuyentes a subsidiar restricciones similares en pases extranjeros.
<dd>	La agenda verde del secretario Christopher incluye la participacin de
Estados Unidos en la reciente Cumbre de la Ciudad, Habitat II, llevada a
cabo en Estambul. Esta fue otra de una serie de conferencias de las Naciones
Unidas sobre el ambiente, la poblacin, la pobreza y los derechos de las
mujeres. En Estambul se trat de conseguir el consenso de que el "desarrollo
sostenible" se convierta en principio fundamental en el desarrollo de las
ciudades y, al igual que en las anteriores conferencias, las discusiones
tuvieron que ver con la redistribucin mundial del ingreso y mayor
intervencin de los gobiernos en la economa.
<dd>	El intento de la administracin Clinton de mezclar cuestiones ambientales
con relaciones diplomticas est destinado al fracaso. Los estadounidenses
no favorecen mayores gastos en programas internacionales. Aunque algunos
gobiernos extranjeros sern tentados a colaborar con el presidente Clinton,
con la esperanza de recibir asistencia financiera, otros se darn cuenta que
las consecuencias de tales imposiciones ambientales conllevan costosas
restricciones al crecimiento econmico y al desarrollo. A fin de cuentas,
todo eso representa niveles inaceptables de intervencin extranjera en los
asuntos internos de naciones soberanas e independientes. &copy;

<h2>
UNIVERSIDADES QUE ENGAAN A LOS ESTUDIANTES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio

William E. Simon
</a>

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- Actualmente hay casi 15 millones de estudiantes en las
universidades de Estados Unidos. Como nacin gastamos anualmente casi
$170.000 millones en estudios superiores. El costo de una educacin
universitaria de cuatro aos flucta, segn la universidad seleccionada,
entre $50.000 y $100.000 y los costos siguen en aumento.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A pesar del financiamiento de fuentes privadas y pblicas, una buena
educacin universitaria es una inversin considerable para la clase media y
conseguir el dinero requerido es una fuente de angustia para muchos padres.
Pero, qu estn recibiendo los estudiantes, los padres y el pblico a
cambio de esa inversin? La triste verdad es que mientras ms jvenes creen
que es esencial tener un ttulo universitario, aunque signifique una pesada
deuda, ms y ms instituciones superiores ofrecen cursos de estudios que la
mayora de los estadounidenses que viven en el mundo real encuentran sin
sentido y sin contenido prctico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Recientemente la National Association of Scholars (NAS), un grupo de
profesores que laboran en reforzar las normas acadmicas, presentaron un
informe desbastador, mostrando hasta donde las principales universidades han
desmantelado rigurosos requisitos que los estudiantes tenan antes que
cumplir para graduarse.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En su investigacin sobre los programas de estudios de 50 universidades,
NAS reporta una disminucin constante desde los aos 60 en requisitos
especficos que antes introducan a los estudiantes a conocimientos bsicos
en reas claves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En lugar de los requisitos bsicos en los primeros dos aos exigidos hace
una generacin, que se fundamentaban en estudios de literatura inglesa,
historia de la civilizacin occidental, idiomas extranjeros, ciencias,
matemticas y religin, a los estudiantes de hoy en las ms famosas
universidades se les da entera libertad para que ocupen su tiempo asistiendo
a una variedad de cursos que estn de moda y cuyo contenido consternara a
estudiantes y profesores de una generacin atrs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El requisito de un idioma extranjero ha sido abolido por muchas de nuestras
mejores universidades. En 1964, por ejemplo, 90% de las universidades
exigan cursos en ciencias naturales, pero para 1994 el nmero se haba
reducido a 34% y en matemticas la obligatoriedad se redujo durante el mismo
perodo de 36% a 12%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La duracin del ao escolar se ha reducido de 191 das de clases en 1964 a
156 en 1993. La proporcin de universidades con clases los sbados cay de
79% a 6% y hasta las clases los viernes son hoy poco frecuentes en algunas
universidades. La duracin de las clases tambin se ha reducido.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Los profesores se han dado cuenta que a medida que se reducen los
requisitos, ellos tienen que dedicarle menos tiempo a los estudiantes,
dedicndolo ms bien a investigacin especializada. Al reducir normas
difciles, los administradores mejoran la retencin de estudiantes, lo cual
es importante a medida que aumenta la competencia entre universidades.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No hay duda de que todo este proceso comenz durante las rebeliones
estudiantiles de los aos 60, cuando los activistas se burlaban de los
programas tradicionales de estudios, tachndolos de irrelevantes en sus
grandiosos proyectos de cambio revolucionario.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Es irnico que cuando necesitamos de una educacin rigurosa para competir
en un exigente mercado mundial, nuestras universidades estn eliminando
requisitos y aadiendo cursos sin valor alguno. Tambin es irnico que ha
medida que el resto del mundo adopta los ideales polticos y econmicos de
la cultura occidental, nuestras instituciones acadmicas se ocupan de
repudiarlos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Afortunadamente contamos con la ayuda de grupos como NAS, a la vez que
padres, estudiantes y funcionarios pblicos comienzan a exigir un adecuado
retorno sobre la inversin en estudios superiores, rechazando cursos tontos
que no sirven para nada. Como siempre sucede en el libre mercado, el mal
servicio ser rechazado y la gente votar con su dinero a favor de una
educacin que prepara a la juventud para una vida productiva de ciudadanos
educados.

FALSEDADES AMBIENTALES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

S. Fred Singer
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Cinco temas ambientales demuestran las
distorsiones y el mal uso de la ciencia en el diseo de polticas
gubernamentales, durante el ltimo ao:
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Recalentamiento de la Tierra: Durante 1995, cuentos de terror predecan
catstrofes por el "efecto invernadero", mientras que la evidencia sobre el
supuesto recalentamiento era cada vez ms dbil. En la primera Conferencia
del Tratado Climtico Mundial, en abril del ao pasado en Berln,
descubrimientos cientficos fueron ignorados, se procedi a establecer un
Secretariado Permanente y a preparar una megaconferencia. En septiembre, por
iniciativa del vicepresidente Al Gore, otra reunin en Washington promovi
un nuevo temor ligado al recalentamiento: la propagacin de enfermedades
tropicales que afectaran a 3.000 millones de personas. En noviembre en
Madrid y en diciembre en Roma, el Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambios
Climticas, auspiciados por las Naciones Unidas, se las ingeni para aprobar
dos informes preliminares en borrador, ambos muy econmicos con la verdad.
Presentaron los hechos en forma selectiva, mientras se abstuvieron de
incluir datos que indican cero recalentamiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante una burocracia desbocada a la que no le importa la evidencia
cientfica, Estados Unidos debe retirarse del Tratado antes de que las
Naciones Unidas nos lleven a la ruina econmica.
<li>Ozono estratosfrico y el cncer de la piel: Desde el 31 de diciembre
est prohibida la fabricacin de gases tipo fren y otras substancias
qumicas bajo la errada creencia que es la manera de evitar una epidemia de
cncer de la piel. La evidencia cientfica no existe y todo se bas en una
conferencia de prensa en 1992, donde se habl de un inminente "agujero de
ozono rtico" que nunca sucedi. No hay evidencia de que las radiaciones
ultravioletas que alcanzan la superficie terrestre estn incrementndose y
mediciones en laboratorios muestran que el melanoma mortal del cncer de la
piel no es afectado por el nivel del ozono atmosfrico.
<li>Humo de segunda mano: En noviembre el Servicio de Investigacin del
Congreso encontr que no hay respaldo cientfico en la teora que el humo de
fumadores causa cncer entre los no fumadores, ya que hubo manipulacin de
las cifras presentadas en las investigaciones de la Agencia de Proteccin
Ambiental (EPA).		
<li>La falsa alarma del gas radn: Antes de la Segunda Guerra, pequeas
dosis radioactivas eran consideradas saludables. Los ricos disfrutaban de
baos termales con agua ligeramente radioactiva. Inclusive nuestros cuerpos
contienen radioactividad natural. Se sabe que dosis radioactivas por debajo
de cierto nivel no son dainas. Sin embargo, la EPA insiste en que el radn
es "la principal amenaza ambiental contra la salud", causando que familias
gasten miles de dlares en detectar y erradicar el radn de sus casas.
<li>El ruinoso afn por "cero riesgo": La ms costosa de todas las
regulaciones es la Clusula Delaney de 1958 que impone el concepto de cero
riesgo. Cuando inmensas dosis de substancias como PCB, dioxn, ETS, alar,
etc. resultan fatales para ratones, se prohibe su inclusin en alimentos,
aunque el contenido sea nfimo. Esto cobra significacin cuando se toma en
cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales estn costando $150.000 millones al
ao, o sea $1.500 por cada familia estadounidense. 
</ol>
<blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La misin principal del Proyecto Ciencia y Medio Ambiente es estudiar el
uso y el mal uso de la ciencia en referencia a leyes ambientales, poniendo
al descubierto fraudes y mitos, como los del asbesto, la lluvia cida y el
alar, para mencionar slo unos pocos que han causado el derroche de miles de
millones de dlares.

<h2>
SEGURO SOCIAL CONTRA LA FAMILIA
</h2>     
     
     
Robert A. Sirico*
<p>

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los votos que he tomado como sacerdote,
incluyendo el de pobreza y castidad, no son para todo el mundo. Otros tienen
la vocacin de ser padres y madres, de proveer para su familia y sus
comunidades. Cuando el gobierno los despoja de su dinero, los est
desanimando de tener hijos y se les coarta artificialmente tal vocacin.
<dd>	Sabemos que los gobiernos reducen la riqueza de la gente a travs de
impuestos y de inflacin. Gracias a programas como el del Seguro Social, los
hijos y las familias extensas han perdido su valor econmico. Antes haba un
contrato implcito de que los padres se ocuparan de sus hijos, quienes a su
vez se ocuparan de los padres cuando estos no pudieran seguirse ganando la
vida. Cada uno sera as protegido durante los aos vulnerables. Hoy en da
a muchos padres les horroriza tener que depender de sus hijos y los hijos
-aun en tiempos malos- resienten tener que ocuparse de sus padres. Que lo
haga el gobierno.
<dd>	Mientras muchos jvenes se lavan las manos en cuanto a la responsabilidad
que tienen con respecto a sus padres, tambin ponen en duda que van a
recibir un centavo en pensiones del Seguro Social. Y tienen razn. Para la
primera dcada del nuevo siglo, los impuestos a la nmina no sern
suficientes para cubrir los beneficios de los pensionados.
<dd>	Ha llegado el momento de dejar de hablar slo de economa e introducir el
elemento moral al debate. Por falta de fuertes argumentos morales del lado
reformista, el intento de reformar la beneficencia pblica fracas el ao
pasado. Una reforma econmica radical necesita de respaldo moral. De otra
forma, la victoria siempre ser de los demagogos.
<dd>	Hay argumentos morales contra el actual sistema de Seguridad Social? Claro
que s. El Seguro Social fue originalmente establecido como una forma de
ahorro. El trabajador aportaba una parte de sus ingresos a cambio de
seguridad econmica en la vejez. Esa es la promesa que el gobierno
cnicamente rompe. Y all mismo est el poderoso argumento moral a favor de
la privatizacin del Seguro Social.
<dd>	Cuando el mercado aporta los servicios, la gente est en libertad de
participar o de retirarse del programa. Los administradores  de los fondos
tienen el incentivo de cumplir con sus obligaciones y con la palabra
empeada. Los que no lo hacen, desaparecen. Pero no es as con el gobierno,
el cual se basa en un intercambio coercitivo, no voluntario. Desaparecen,
entonces, los incentivos para cumplir con lo ofrecido. Por eso es que el
gobierno utiliza los fondos del Seguro Social en gastos corrientes,
reemplazndolos con promesas de pago. Por eso es que se acusa al Seguro
Social de ser una pirmide fraudulenta.
<dd>	Los trabajadores no tienen manera de salirse aunque saben que se trata de
un fraude. La "promesa" ha dejado de parecerse a un contrato, convirtindose
en un sistema basado en el saqueo intergeneracional, con el botn
disminuyendo progresivamente a travs del tiempo. Las nuevas generaciones no
slo dejarn de percibir los intereses sino que ni siquiera recuperarn el
capital. Tampoco contarn con la ayuda de sus hijos cuando estn viejos. A
menos que hagamos algo se incrementarn las peleas y las recriminaciones
entre las generaciones
<dd>	Sin el Seguro Social, los jvenes estaran nuevamente conscientes de su
obligacin de pagar la deuda que tienen con sus padres. Cada uno planeara
su futuro, en lugar de depender de programas coercitivos del gobierno. Las
distintas generaciones comenzaran a redescubrir el valor de cada una de ellas.
<dd>	La moralidad del mercado es que los contratos son honestos y las promesas
se cumplen. Los gobiernos no estn atados a tales valores morales.

LA VERDADERA MORAL

<p>
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los dirigentes empresariales tienen un
inters personal en promover la comprensin pblica de la economa de
mercado. Sin embargo, ellos pronto se rinden cuando la oposicin
izquierdista se envuelve a s misma en un manto religioso.
<P>
 No tiene que ser as. Veamos el caso de la firma Briggs & Stratton (B&S) de
Milwaukee, fabricante de pequeos motores. En diciembre de 1994 fue atacada
editorialmente por los medios izquierdistas catlicos por despedir a
trabajadores. La empresa respondi con una demanda de difamacin y una
campaa en defensa de la economa de mercado.
<P>
 Thomas Fox, director del National Catholic Reporter, identific a tres
altos ejecutivos de B&S como catlicos, acusndolos de "haberse desviado de
las enseanzas sociales de la Iglesia". El peridico acus a los tres de
"ceguera moral" ante la maldad de los despidos.
<P>
 El artculo asuma que es inmoral que una empresa mude sus operaciones a
otra parte, aunque ello sea necesario para su supervivencia. Segn el cdigo
moral de este peridico catlico, los patronos deben garantizarle a la
fuerza laboral actual sus altos salarios de por vida, se estn ellos ganando
o no los sueldos.
<P>
 Veamos lo que pas en B&S. En 1983 sus motores eran manufacturados en
Milwaukee por miembros del sindicato. Con una penetracin de 65% en el
mercado de cortadoras de grama en Estados Unidos, B&S pagaba un promedio de
salarios 30% ms altos que la competencia. Las relaciones con el sindicato
eran amistosas.
<P>
 Con una posicin privilegiada en el mercado, la empresa poda complacer la
mayora de las exigencias del sindicato, lo cual se financiaba con precios
ms altos de sus motores. Pero esto eventualmente atrajo la competencia de
otros fabricantes y de empresas japonesas. La gerencia se dio cuenta que
tena que realizar cambios para mantener sus ventas.
<P>
 Fred Stratton, el presidente de la empresa, explic al sindicato la
necesidad de congelar salarios y de pagar menos a los nuevos empleados, a la
vez de mayor flexibilidad en las operaciones de la planta. El sindicato
declar una huelga que dur tres meses, provocando una crisis, al no poder
la empresa cumplir con los pedidos de sus clientes, quienes comenzaron a
cambiarse a otros proveedores.
<P>
 B&S respondi mudando parte de la produccin a Murray, Kentucky y a Poplar
Bluff, Missouri, empleando mano de obra ms barata. No se trataba de
"avaricia empresarial" sino de intransigencia sindical y el grueso de la
produccin permaneci en Milwaukee.
<P>
 Las cosas empeoraron. En 1989 B&S sufri prdidas por $20 millones, pero
todava insista en quedarse en Milwaukee. La gerencia convenci a los
lderes sindicales de aceptar una congelacin salarial de cuatro aos,
prometiendo no mudar las operaciones en tres aos y medio. El sindicato
procedi a violar sistemticamente el espritu del acuerdo, rehus aportar
trabajadores para nuevos departamentos e instrumentaron una "operacin
tortuga" ilegal.
<P>
 Ante la creciente competencia y mayores aumentos en sus costos, B&S dio un
preaviso de un ao a dos mil de sus trabajadores y comenz a utilizar
crecientemente sus instalaciones en reas donde pagaba menores sueldos. Si
el peridico catlico hubiese realmente querido ayudar a los trabajadores,
no ha debido culpar a los gerentes sino decirle a los trabajadores que
aceptaran las realidades econmicas y colaboraran con su empresa en reducir
costos. Ha debido recordarle a los trabajadores que tambin ellos tienen una
obligacin moral: dar un da de trabajo por el salario recibido y no
perjudicar a la empresa donde trabajan.
<P>
 Pero gente como Thomas Fox y el resto de la izquierda religiosa les
interesa menos ayudar a los trabajadores que hacer propaganda
antiempresarial. Dada las dificultades, los ejecutivos de B&S, actuaron como
buenos catlicos, satisfaciendo a sus clientes y creando puestos de trabajo.
Fue el sindicato y el peridico catlico los que violaron la justicia social
y los preceptos morales.

<TITLE>Smith: Sea Bueno, Produzca Utilidades -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>SEA BUENO, PRODUZCA UTILIDADES</H2>
Fred L. Smith*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El fracaso del socialismo ha obligado a muchos de sus
partidarios a buscar nuevas maneras de alcanzar viejos objetivos. Ahora una
variante popular es la "responsabilidad social de la empresa". Los ex
socialistas ahora admiten que el capitalismo juega un papel importante, pero
ese papel debe ser limitado porque omite valores importantes, tales como la
"equidad" en el trabajo, las ramificaciones ecolgicas de actividades
empresariales, el impacto sobre los nios y las minoras, las virtudes de un
trabajo seguro, etc. Alegan que si juntamos la eficiencia capitalista con la
justicia social, el mundo sera mejor. Es eso verdad?
<dd>	
Es cierto que el capitalismo tiene sus problemas, aquellos que el
economista Schumpeter llam "elementos destructivos creativos". Cuando una
gran empresa quiebra, causa el caos entre miles de vidas. Si un producto
est mal diseado o se utiliza de manera no anticipada el resultado puede
ser desastroso. Una industria puede manejar mal sus residuos y desechos,
tirndolos a un ro o al aire que respiran sus vecinos. A menudo la frialdad
impersonal del mercado amenaza los clidos valores de una sociedad tradicional.
<dd>	
No sera maravilloso si los ciudadanos-trabajadores, motivados por una
cvica filantropa y laborando en empresas conscientes de sus
responsabilidades sociales se unieran todos para eliminar la pobreza, el
racismo, la contaminacin y dems prejuicios e iniquidades del mundo? 
<dd>	
Cuidado. El resultado podra ser mucho peor que la realidad de hoy. El
movimiento en pro de la "responsabilidad empresarial" no comprende los retos
de la sociedad moderna: la necesidad de la especializacin y de
interacciones annimas. El altruismo es un atributo demasiado raro para ser
la base de una sociedad moderna porque no hay suficiente cantidad de Madres
Teresas para lograrlo. Como lo expres Adam Smith, una larga vida apenas
genera un reducido grupo de amigos ntimos, pero todos los das tratamos
pacficamente, a travs del mercado, con un inmenso mundo compuesto de
extraos. El comunitarismo no es suficiente para organizar a una sociedad
moderna. Confiar en los ms diversos intereses personales para organizar
tales relaciones no es el resultado de la maldad sino, ms bien, de la
necesidad.
<dd>	
Una empresa junto con sus accionistas debe ocuparse de su "familia"
corporativa inmediata: sus empleados y vecinos, sus suplidores y sus
clientes. Esos grupos tienen un inters en la prosperidad a largo plazo de
la firma. Extender esa relacin al resto del mundo es permitir que se
entrometa gente que no tiene ninguna razn para averiguar el valor de la
empresa ni importarle su supervivencia. La sociedad moderna es posible
porque la mayora de la gente est excluida de la mayora de las
actividades. Las instituciones del mercado -propiedad privada, contratos, la
compaa annima- son dispositivos de exclusin. Estos crean esferas
circunscritas de responsabilidad y poder, en las cuales cada uno de nosotros
juega papeles especializados para mutuo beneficio.
<dd>	
Una empresa no se funda para resolver los problemas del mundo. Su formato
distingue a un grupo de personas como accionistas -los que aportan capital-
de todas los dems. La empresa contrata gerentes para administrar el capital
en beneficio de los accionistas. Inclusive, el inters de los accionistas
tiende a limitarse a si la empresa es lucrativa o no; a si su dinero estara
mejor invertido en otra parte. No tomar eso en cuenta y pretender que "su
empresa" es "mi empresa" nos conduce al colectivismo, lo cual socava las
bases de la sociedad moderna y amenaza con devolvernos a un pasado tribal.

<h2>GUERRA CONTRA FABRICAS LATINOAMERICANAS</h2><br>
Irwin Stelzer*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columinsits/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los altos ejecutivos estadounidenses estn descontentos.
Primero fueron el blanco de crticas por sus altos salarios, enfrentan
incertidumbre en la Bolsa de Valores y, adems, estn siendo acusados de
explotar a mujeres y nios en los pases en desarrollo.<dd>
	Las empresas estadounidenses dependen de contratistas y subcontratistas
extranjeros que manufacturan de todo, desde franelas para Gap hasta zapatos
Nike. Esto fue llevado a la atencin del pblico cuando denunciantes
revelaron que la ropa vendida con el nombre de una conocida presentadora de
televisin estaba siendo producida tanto en Honduras como en la ciudad de
Nueva York bajo malas condiciones de trabajo.<dd>
	En el escndalo que sigui, Kathie Lee Gifford, la presentadora de
televisin, casada con un conocido atleta, pidi perdn con lgrimas en los
ojos ante una Comisin del Congreso, mientras su marido distribua billetes
entre los oprimidos trabajadores en Nueva York y todo ello era filmado por
las cmaras de televisin.<dd>
	Simultneamente, Michael Jordan, la estrella del baloncesto firmaba un
contrato por $25 millones, una cantidad que fcilmente doblar con su
patrocinio de Nike. Los denunciantes lo acusaron, entonces, de ganancias
inmorales, mientras los trabajadores que manufacturan los Nike ganan unos
pocos dlares al da.<dd>
	Peor todava, algunas de las fbricas que producen marcas americanas
mantienen condiciones indeseables, por lo menos segn el estndar de este
pas, acostumbrado al aire acondicionado en las factoras. As que adems de
acusaciones de trasladar la manufactura de sus productos a otros pases y
despedir empleados estadounidenses, a los ejecutivos ahora se les acusa de
explotar a nios del Tercer Mundo para aumentar sus ya groseras ganancias.<dd>
	Las acusaciones provienen no slo de reformistas bien intencionados sino de
sindicatos empeados en reducirle la competencia al obrero estadounidense.
Se trata de una guerra de los sindicatos en contra de la globalizacin de la
economa.<dd>
	Lamentablemente, los argumentos sobre la responsabilidad de las empresas
norteamericanas hacia los trabajadores extranjeros estn dominados por
emociones ms que razones. Una activista me inform haber logrado convencer
a una cadena de tiendas a dejar de utilizar muchachas para elaborar la ropa
que venden. Cuando le pregunt qu estaban haciendo ahora esas jvenes
salvadoreas desempleadas, me contest que asuma habran regresado a la
escuela. Es mucho ms probable que estn ahora trabajando por salarios ms
bajos y en peores condiciones.<dd>
	Es cierto que Nike se ha convertido en un gigante, pero que est obligado a
hacer ms que obedecer la ley de los pases donde opera es una propuesta
dudosa. No es probable que los trabajadores de las naciones en desarrollo
estaran mejor si Estados Unidos restringe la fabricacin en el extranjero.
Un ejecutivo me cuenta que l paga $25 mensuales a trabajadores chinos,
quienes se han convertido en los ricos del pueblo. En Honduras, los
trabajadores que cosen pantalones Levi's ganan $5,40 al da, el doble del
salario mnimo.<dd>
	Los que se la dan de protectores de los trabajadores mexicanos y
centroamericanos estn tratando de acabar con puestos de trabajo que ofrecen
oportunidades escasas en esos pases, sin aumentar los precios que los
consumidores pagan por tales productos. <p>

<TITLE>COSTA RICA:  ESTAFA LEGALIZADA -- 10/09/96</TITLE>

<H2>COSTA RICA: ESTAFA LEGALIZADA</H2>
Rigoberto Stewart*<br>
<p>
SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
La deuda pblica se ha convertido
mundialmente en un grave problema que amenaza destruir economas y los
sistemas democrticos. Sin embargo, pocos pases encaran con seriedad el
problema y Costa Rica no es uno de ellos. 
<P>El problema es que los gobiernos gastan mucho ms de lo que recaudan y
prefieren financiar el dficit con crditos y con emisiones monetarias, que
es un impuesto indirecto. As, cada administracin deja en herencia a la
siguiente una deuda mayor. Por tal razn, la deuda pblica costarricense
crece como una bola de nieve.
<P>Entre 1993 y 1996, la deuda interna en Costa Rica se triplic. En
1996 crece 26% sobre 1995 y en 1997 aumentar 27%. A finales de 1995, la
deuda pblica total -interna, externa y no documentada a algunas
instituciones pblicas, como el Seguro Social- era de $6.943 millones,
equivalente a 77% del PIB. Y en 1997 se espera que llegue a US$7.937. La
deuda total por habitante crece ms rpido que la produccin econmica
(PIB). Esto indica que el pas no se est endeudando para realizar
inversiones productivas, y que pronto un sector grande de la poblacin
trabajar slo para pagar la deuda.
<P>Es sostenible tal situacin? El ministro de Hacienda dice que no hay
parmetros internacionales que indiquen el nivel ptimo de la deuda pblica.
No obstante, el PIB es un buen indicador de la capacidad de pago. Los
estadounidenses han estado alarmados porque su deuda pblica ha oscilado
entre 24% y 42% del PIB desde 1933, y porque el pago de intereses ha
representado entre 7% y 14% del presupuesto fiscal, y entre 1,5% y 3% del
PIB. En Costa Rica, la deuda alcanzar 86% del PIB en 1997, mientras que el
pago de intereses ya representa un tercio del gasto pblico anual y ms del
5% del PIB. Adems de alarmante, esta situacin es totalmente insostenible.
Pero las autoridades, que siguen gastando a manos llenas, apenas dan
muestras de preocupacin.
<P>Aparte de otros daos, la deuda pblica frena el desarrollo. Al recurrir a
los mercados financieros en busca de recursos, el gobierno impide que muchas
empresas obtengan financiamiento, a la vez que hace subir las tasas de
inters. Esto conduce a menos inversin, menos produccin, menos empleo
productivo y menos creacin de riqueza. Y al tomar dinero de instituciones
pblicas, como  la  Caja de Seguro Social y de telecomunicaciones, deja a la
ciudadana con menos servicios pblicos.
<P>En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes suelen ejercer el poder
endeudando a la poblacin sin ningn lmite, y cuatro aos despus se van,
sin responder por sus actos. Adems, casi todo el crdito pblico va a
gastos, no a inversin, lo que implica que los gobernantes se estn comiendo
hoy la produccin de generaciones futuras. Algo realmente inmoral.  
<P>En Costa Rica, adems, la deuda pblica ha sido un instrumento de estafa.
El 58% de la deuda interna es contrada con instituciones del Estado, o sea,
el Estado se endeuda consigo mismo; pero le cobra la factura a los
contribuyentes. En realidad, esta deuda tambin representa impuestos futuros
dilapidados hoy. Por otra parte, 42% de la deuda es con el sector privado.
En este caso, el Estado le pide prestado a los ricos para concederles
privilegios, pero recurre a los pobres para cancelar la deuda. Este esquema
es un mecanismo de transferencia de pobres a ricos. Una estafa legalizada.
<P>Hoy sabemos que no hay ningn servicio que no pueda ser
brindado por una entidad diferente al Estado. De ah que, los libertarios
costarricenses han propuesto las siguientes tres acciones, para solucionar
definitivamente el problema de la deuda: Primero, vender los activos del
Estado y, con el dinero, cancelar la deuda. Para lograr el mayor precio
posible, los activos seran vendidos mediante subastas abiertas a todo el
mundo. Se ha estimado que la venta del Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (electricidad y telecomunicaciones) podra generar unos $1.500
millones, la mitad de la deuda externa. Segundo, retirar al Estado de todas
las actividades que no le competen. Tercero, prohibir, por medio de la
Constitucin, el endeudamiento futuro del Estado. Esto ltimo es esencial
para que la solucin del problema sea permanente.

<h2>
SOCIALISMO VENEZOLANO SOCORRIDO POR EL FMI
</h2>     
     
     
Alejandro J. Sucre
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Con la ceremonia de la firma del prstamo de $1.400
millones, el Fondo Monetario Internacional est oficialmente de vuelta en
Venezuela desde el 3 de junio. El director gerente del FMI, Michael
Camdessus, nos record -lleno de orgullo- que a raz del anterior acuerdo en
1989 el gasto social y la inversin gubernamental aumentaron. Los polticos
venezolanos respiran ahora aliviados por el auxilio del FMI y los
inversionistas extranjeros estn alertas a oportunidades de negocios.
Irnicamente, el venezolano comn fue quien sali perdiendo.
Se han dado algunos pasos positivos. En enero, el gobierno venezolano
reabri el sector petrolero a inversionistas extranjeros. El nombramiento de
Teodoro Petkoff -un ex guerrillero comunista- como ministro de Planificacin
ha sido bien recibido por su nueva retrica pro mercado.  El gobierno acept
las condiciones del FMI sobre la eliminacin del control de precios y de
cambios, terminando tambin con el inmenso subsidio al precio de la gasolina.
Pero tales medidas en realidad significan muy poco. El FMI nos impuso sus
tpicas medidas de austeridad e incremento de impuestos.  Peor todava, el
prstamo del FMI slo sirve para  financiar la crisis de balanza de pagos,
la cual debi haber sido resuelta a travs de los mecanismos de mercado. Y
la apertura petrolera a inversionistas extranjeros lejos de significar la
privatizacin de la industria petrolera la aleja porque las utilidades
compartidas y los ingresos impositivos del nuevo esquema de explotacin irn
directamente a engrosar el estado. Esos nuevos ingresos lejos de ser
herramientas de desarrollo sern el nuevo sustento de las corruptas
instituciones polticas.  
<dd>Venezuela sigue dndole la espalda a la solucin a sus problemas: el
traspaso a manos privadas de los inmensos activos que el estado derrocha.
Por este camino seguimos avanzando hacia la desintegracin econmica,
mientras que los nuevos recursos petroleros y el acuerdo con el FMI
facilitan y financian esa fatal trayectoria.
<dd>Durante los ltimos 20 aos, el estamento poltico venezolano ha acumulado
control sobre los activos del pas a una velocidad vertiginosa. Se estima
que 70% de los activos productivos pertenecen al estado, contra 25% en 1970.
Las propiedades del estado incluyen todas las minas, el petrleo, fbricas
petroqumicas, las industrias de aluminio y acero, playas, puertos, gran
parte de las tierras agrcolas, inmuebles, hoteles, 60% del sistema
bancario, compaas manufactureras, estaciones de radio y televisin, etc. Y
todas esas empresas estatales, a excepcin de las petroleras, pierden dinero
a manos llenas. Sin el esquema de apertura petrolera y el financiamiento del
FMI, el estado venezolano se vera obligado a privatizar.
<dd>A pesar de los inmensos ingresos petroleros (ms de $350.000 millones desde
1976), estos ya resultan insuficientes para los polticos, drenando su poder
de comprar elecciones. Segn las ltimas encuestas, ningn poltico ni
partido goza de ms del 8% de las preferencias del electorado. Pero el
retroceso logrado ha sido dantesco. 
<dd>Desde 1976, el PIB per capita del venezolano ha cado en 39% y la inflacin
se ha multiplicado 110 veces. Hoy el dficit fiscal equivale al 16% del PIB;
el servicio de la deuda externa absorbe 25% de las exportaciones; la deuda
es de $35.000 millones; el desempleo de 20% y  51% de  la poblacin activa
trabaja en el sector informal de la economa. La clase media se ha contrado
de 25% a apenas 18% de la poblacin.  
<p>
En lugar de correr la arruga endeudndonos ms, aumentando impuestos y
tarifas de servicios pblicos, el gobierno debi superar la crisis
instrumentando las reformas necesarias: 
<ul>
<li>  Privatizacin del 20% de la industria petrolera para pagar toda la deuda
externa.
<li>  Liquidacin de $2.000 millones de activos bancarios asumidos por el
estado a raz de la crisis del sector financiero de 1994, para reducir la
deuda pblica interna y el costo de intereses.
<li>  Reducir el gasto pblico a travs de un programa de capitalizacin que
coloque en manos de los ciudadanos todos los activos del estado socialista,
incluyendo escuelas pblicas, hospitales y el 80% remanente de PDVSA.  Slo
devolviendo a la ciudadana la propiedad de los activos productivos de la
nacin se cambia el rumbo econmico. Los subsidios a la gasolina, los
impuestos ni las tarifas de los servicios pblicos se han debido alterar
antes de traspasarle a la ciudadana los recursos productivos del pas.
El FMI ha tenido un papel vergonzoso en toda esta comedia de errores.
Financiar el dficit fiscal con nuevo endeudamiento y elevando impuestos se
sacrifica y se empobrece ms al pueblo. Luego del alboroto propagandstico
de las ltimas semanas, la Venezuela de hoy sigue siendo la misma de ayer.
La economa sigue en manos de polticos y burcratas ineptos y corruptos,
mientras que los burcratas del FMI parecen creer que el capitalismo slo
funciona en las naciones del G-7y hay que evitar su contagio al mundo en
desarrollo.
</ul>
<dd>	Ningn plan del FMI ni pacto estatista con las grandes corporaciones
petroleras detendr la devaluacin, la inflacin y el progresivo
empobrecimiento, a menos que el ciudadano comn tenga los incentivos
necesarios para convertirse en verdadero motor de la economa. Por ahora,
los venezolanos estamos forzados a aceptar la Agenda Caldera-FMI: aumento de
impuestos y de los servicios pblicos y seremos testigos de cmo esos fondos
son despilfarrados. &copy;

Haiti, El Gran Engao*
</h2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace dos aos regres a Hait Jean Bertrand Aristide
bajo la proteccin de 20.000 soldados estadounidenses enviados por el
presidente Clinton para restaurar la democracia en un pas que nunca la ha
experimentado. La administracin Clinton alega que su intervencin militar
en Hait ha sido uno de los mayores xitos de la poltica exterior en la
historia americana. La realidad es que no se diferencia mucho de las dems
aventuras extranjeras de Clinton: Bosnia, Irlanda del Norte, Corea del Norte
y el Medio Oriente.
<p>
Los contribuyentes estadounidenses han desembolsillado ms de $2.000
millones para financiar la intervencin en Hait y todava ninguno de los
propsitos de la "Operacin Rescate de la Democracia" ha sido alcanzado. No
se ha establecido una firme y duradera democracia. Continan los asesinatos
polticos. Siguen las presiones econmicas y polticas para que la gente
emigre a Estados Unidos. 70% de la poblacin no sabe leer y 60% est
desempleada. Escuadrones armados estn surgiendo en el interior de la isla.
<p>
La eleccin presidencial del 17 de diciembre de 1995 result ser ni justa
ni libre, segn el Centro Carter y la presidencia de Ren Preval consolida a
Aristide como gobernante absoluto, ya que Preval har el papel de ttere por
cinco aos hasta que Aristide pueda volver a ser candidato en el ao 2000.
Gracias al apoyo de Clinton, Aristide es el lder poltico ms temido y
poderoso de Hait desde tiempos de 'Pap Doc' Duvalier. Desde su regreso,
Aristide tambin se ha hecho millonario. Los tmidos intentos privatizadores
de Preval han sido bloqueados por Aristide y nada se ha adelantado en abrir
una economa que sigue estancada.
<p>
Bejamin Gilman, presidente del Comit de Relaciones Internacionales de la
Cmara de Representantes del Congreso de Estados Unidos afirma que la
administracin Clinton "sabe desde principios de 1995 que escuadrones de la
muerte operan bajo la direccin de los jefes de seguridad del presidente
Aristide". El embajador de Estados Unidos en la isla, William Swing, inform
sobre el primero de estos asesinatos en un cable al Departamento de Estado
el 18 de febrero de 1995. Luego, en septiembre de 1995, Swing inform que el
gobierno de Aristide haba obstaculizado las investigaciones del FBI de
estos mismos asesinatos polticos. Unos 24 lderes democrticos, opositores
de Aristide, fueron asesinados en 1995, mientras muchos soldados americanos
permanecan en la isla. Todos los asesinatos fueron relacionados
directamente a los jefes de seguridad del Palacio Presidencial y Aristide
rechaz las peticiones privadas del embajador Swing y del subsecretario de
Estado Strobe Talbott para que destituyera a los culpables.
<p>
Esa misma guardia palaciega, entrenada en Virginia a un costo para los
contribuyentes estadounidenses de $5,5 millones, sigue cuidando a Preval y
exterminando a la oposicin durante 1996. El 13 de septiembre de este ao,
el gobierno de Estados Unidos envi urgentemente a 46 agentes del
Departamento de Estado y del Pentgono a Puerto Prncipe al enterarse de
rumores de golpe contra Preval. Entonces fue cuando Preval destituy al jefe
de la guardia de seguridad presidencial y a su asistente, tras una reunin
secreta con Talbott, Swing y Anthony Lake, asesor de Seguridad Nacional del
presidente Clinton.
<p>
El gobierno de Clinton est engaando al Congreso y al pblico con respecto
a Hait. La complicidad de la administracin en la poltica interna haitiana
es tan sucia que el presidente Clinton se ha visto obligado a invocar
razones de estado para tapar el total fracaso de la Operacin Rescate de la
Democracia. Aristide, un cura antiamericano que ahorc los hbitos y
pblicamente daba el visto bueno a los asesinatos de sus opositores, antes
de ser tumbado en 1991, tiene a la Casa Blanca agarrada por el pescuezo.
Clinton puede mantener el mito de una frgil paz en Hait mientras Aristide
se lo permita. Hait sigue siendo un polvorn que estallar poco despus de
la retirada de las ltimas tropas de Estados Unidos y de las Naciones Unidas.

EL VOTO LATINO EN LAS ELECCIONES AMERICANAS
</H2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- El voto latino, por mucho tiempo una fuerza silente en
las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses, el 5 de noviembre acudi a
las urnas de votacin en cantidades sin precedentes en California, Florida,
Nueva York y otros estados claves, ayudando la victoria del presidente
Clinton, en momentos cuando la proporcin de votantes fue la ms baja en una
eleccin presidencial desde 1924.
<P>
 Los votantes latinos tambin produjeron la victoria de candidatos
demcratas en contiendas peliagudas al Congreso y las legislaturas
estadales. Encuestas postelectorales en California, donde vive la mitad de
los latinos en este pas, muestran que votaron por Clinton y dems
candidatos demcratas en proporcin de 3 a 1. En estados como Texas, Nueva
York y Arizona, donde suelen ganar los republicanos, los latinos se
inclinaron por candidatos demcratas en proporcin de hasta 17 a 1.
<P>
 El voto masivo de los latinos en parte tuvo que ver con la aceleracin de
las concesiones de nacionalidad por parte de la administracin Clinton, que
alcanz a ms de un milln de nuevos ciudadanos en el ltimo ao y, tambin,
por agresivas campaas para que salieran a votar en las comunidades latinas.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la razn principal de que el voto latino se haya inclinado
fuertemente hacia los demcratas es la percepcin generalizada del Partido
Republicano como antiinmigrante y antilatino. El Partido Republicano
enfrenta serios problemas con los votantes latinos. Al igual que con todas
las inmigraciones anteriores, los inmigrantes que se nacionalizan tienden a
ser ms jvenes, menos afluentes y con menos educacin que la poblacin en
general.
<P>
Las encuestas muestran que los latinos son firmes creyentes en la familia,
el trabajo duro, la fe religiosa y la seguridad jurdica, exactamente los
valores sociales que predican los republicanos conservadores. Que hayan
repudiado a los republicanos en proporcin aplastante obligar a los lderes
de ese partido a reconsiderar su posicin sobre inmigracin.
<P>
 Una de las razones por las que Bob Dole escogi a Jack Kemp como candidato
a la vicepresidencia fue por la decidida posicin de ste a favor de la
inmigracin, el comercio hemisfrico y de relaciones ms estrechas con
Amrica Latina.
<P>
 Pero la retrica antimexicana de Pat Buchanan, las reformas a la
beneficencia social que discriminan contra los inmigrantes legales
instrumentadas por el Congreso republicano y el referendo antiinmigracin
apoyado agresivamente por Pete Wilson, gobernador republicano de California,
convencieron a la mayora de los latinos que el Partido Republicano no
representa sus valores como ciudadanos de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Este brinco al Partido Demcrata ocurre justamente cuando est creciendo
rpidamente el voto latino. Entre 1992 y 1996, el voto latino en California
creci de 7% a 10%, de 10% a 16% en Texas y de 11% a 12% en Florida.
<P>
 Las tendencias demogrficas sealan la creciente importancia del voto
latino durante los prximos 12 aos. Segn la oficina del censo, antes de 30
aos los latinos conformarn el 25% de la poblacin de Estados Unidos,
mientras que la minora negra se mantendr entre 12% y 14%.
<P>
 El presidente Clinton obtuvo el voto latino sin competencia alguna. La
decisin poco inteligente de los lderes republicanos en cuanto a atacar la
inmigracin les explot en la cara, ayudando con su retrica antiinmigrante
a los candidatos demcratas.

Carlota Wigglesworth*<br>
<p>

LONDRES  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Un creciente nmero de mujeres latinoamericanas est siendo
atrapado en el terrible mundo de la pobreza y el vicio, al dedicarse al
srdido transporte de drogas. <p>
Tengo tiempo  trabajando  con mujeres  latinoamericanas en crceles de Gran
Bretaa, detenidas casi todas en los aeropuertos de Heathrow y Gatwick por
transportar drogas, principalmente cocana. En los ltimos meses he notado
un cambio radical y preocupante en la mecnica de esa importacin. Venezuela
se perfila como el puerto de salida de la droga proveniente de Colombia,
Per y Bolivia con destino a Europa. Por aos, en el grupo de 94 latinas
encarceladas en Inglaterra, haba una sola venezolana y la mayora eran
colombianas. Este ao, el nmero de venezolanas ha aumentado
considerablemente y aunque las detenciones son de nacionalidades variadas,
todas procedan de Venezuela. La edad promedio es de 22 aos; casi todas son
madres solteras, sin medios para mantener a sus hijos.  Sin ningn tipo de
recursos ni de apoyo familiar, terminan siendo reclutadas por los
narcotraficantes, quienes se concentran en los sectores pobres. En
Venezuela, 84% de la poblacin vive hoy en la pobreza y madres desesperadas
son especialmente vulnerables a las promesas de los narcotraficantes. <p>
	El reclutamiento de las llamadas "mulas" funciona de la siguiente manera.
Los agentes identifican a mujeres con deudas y desespero por cubrir las
necesidades bsicas de su familia. Le ofrecen "amistad" y ayuda material.
Cuando la mujer se enreda, la obligan a pagar la deuda trabajando en el
transporte de paquetes con droga. Si la desdichada trata de salirse del
compromiso, la amenazan con maltratar y hasta matar a sus hijos y dems
familiares. Una vez que la mujer est atrapada, la obligan a tragar
cpsulas, burdamente preparadas, rellenando condones o dedos de guantes
quirrgicos con cocana. Algunas han tragado hasta 100 cpsulas o las
"embalsaman"; esto es, sujetan pequeas bolsas de cocana al cuerpo con
vendajes. As las montan, generalmente por primera vez, en aviones. Otras
traen droga en tacones falsos, en el forro de la ropa, en maletines y bolsos
de mano, en cosmticos y hasta en alimentos.<p>
	Las autoridades britnicas estn muy bien equipadas para detectar
contrabando de drogas y los inspectores de aduana son muy competentes. Aqu
la ley es muy severa respecto al narcotrfico.<p>
En los aeropuertos de Londres presencio continuamente duras interrogaciones
a travs de intrpretes. Las someten a exmenes de rayos X y las detienen en
celdas hasta que la droga ingerida sea evacuada. La droga se pesa y se
analiza para establecer su pureza y cantidad, de lo cual depender la
ulterior sentencia.<p>
	Del aeropuerto estas mujeres son trasladadas a la prisin de Holloway,
donde permanecen hasta ser sentenciadas, unos seis meses ms tarde. Luego,
las transfieren a prisiones en el interior del pas, donde cumplen condenas
de 7, 9 o 12 aos. Sin saber el idioma ni conocer el sistema legal o las
regulaciones de la crcel, estas mujeres ingresan a un infierno, donde el
peor castigo es no saber de sus hijos y familiares.<p>
	Tenemos varios casos de mujeres que dejaron hijos pequeos a cargo de una
amiga cuando salieron de viaje "por una semana", bajo promesas de $200 a
$600 por transportar cocana con un valor en la calle de 30 a 45 mil
dlares. Los nios, quienes pronto dejan de estar a cargo de la amiga,
generalmente tan pobre como la "mula", seguidamente ingresan al implacable
crculo de la pobreza-vicio-droga-crimen.<p>
	La mujer una vez reclutada no tiene escape. Si cumple con xito su primera
misin, vuelven a usarla; si la detienen, la familia es vctima de
represalias. Visito a tres  mujeres que les  mataron los hijos. Una
colombiana recibi en la crcel la noticia del asesinato de su hijo de 16
aos, a quien durmiendo en casa de la abuela lo ejecutaron de un tiro en la
sien. A otra colombiana le mataron la hija saliendo de una tienda en Cali y
a un tercer nio lo arroll y mat un automvil, mientras que al hermano de
otra detenida lo asesinaron a palos. Vi los certificados de defuncin tengo
las pruebas.<p>
	Una espaola, detenida al llegar de Venezuela, cuenta que para drogarse se
endeud con el cartel y fue reclutada, "una vez que entras en ese circulo
-me dijo- no te puedes salir aunque lo desees y trates... despus de uno de
mis intentos de escapar, mataron a mi hermano en represalia".  <p>
	No quiero slo ayudar en lo que puedo a estas desdichadas mujeres, sino
tambin dar a conocer este horrible drama para evitar que otras muchachas
caigan en la misma tentacin, creyendo que los narcotraficantes les van a
resolver sus problemas. Slo lograrn destruir sus vidas y exponer a seres
queridos a la tortura y el asesinato. <p>

<h2>
POBRES PERO NO TONTOS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Walter Williams
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Entre 1965 y 1994, los programas gubernamentales
para eliminar la pobreza le costaron al contribuyente estadounidense
$5.400.000.000.000. Con esa cantidad se pueden comprar todas las fbricas,
toda la maquinaria industrial y todos los edificios de oficinas de este
pas. Con el dinero que queda, se pueden comprar todas las lneas areas, de
transporte terrestre y martimo. Y si todava tiene ganas de seguir de
compras, podra adquirir todas las estaciones de televisin, de radio y
plantas de energa elctrica, adems de todas las tiendas al detal y todas
las empresas mayoristas. Y todava quedaran suficientes fondos como para
comprar todo el sector agrcola, maderero y pesquero de la nacin. La
tragedia es que durante los prximos cinco aos se proyectan gastar
$2.800.000.000.000 en estos mismos programas.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Acaso los pobres reciben todo ese inmenso caudal de dinero? En 1993
haban 40 millones de pobres en Estados Unidos y se gastaron $324.000
millones en programas para combatir la pobreza, lo cual equivale a darle
$8.100 a cada persona pobre o $34.400 a cada familia pobre. Lo que en
realidad sucede es que el grueso de ese dinero no le llega a los pobres sino
que queda en manos de los parsitos que forman parte de la "industria de la
pobreza".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Adems, la forma en que estos programas estn diseados simplemente le
impiden a la gente con ganas de ganarse la vida salir del crculo vicioso
impuesto por el gobierno. Por ejemplo, en el estado de Oregon, el "paquete"
de ayuda gubernamental que recibe una madre soltera con dos nios es de
$16.959 al ao. Para que le quede esa cantidad neta, despus de pagar
impuestos, esa misma mujer tendra que percibir un sueldo anual de $19,000,
o sea $9,23 por hora. En Hawai el "paquete" de ayuda social para esa madre
es $27.736, lo cual quiere decir que para mantener su nivel de ingresos
trabajando tendra que ganar $17,50 por hora. El monto de salario por hora
equivalente a los beneficios percibidos por una madre soltera con dos nios
es de $14,75 en la ciudad de Nueva York, $12,45 en Filadelfia, $11,35 en
Baltimore y $10,90 en Detroit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Muchos de los beneficiarios de la ayuda social no tienen el entrenamiento
ecesario para ganar tales salarios. Son pobres, pero no son tan tontos como
para dejar de percibir beneficios que equivalen a $12 o $14 por hora para
esforzarse en conseguir un trabajo que les pague $5 o $6 por hora, adems de
tener que levantarse temprano, cumplir con la disciplina de un trabajo,
pasarse ocho horas diarias recibiendo rdenes de sus supervisores y gastar
en transporte, ropa adecuada, etc. Las encuestas muestran que el 70% de los
beneficiarios de ayuda social gubernamental no buscan empleo. En el largo
plazo, esto tiene devastadoras consecuencias para el pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Para mantener el Estado Beneficencia, el Congreso le saca del bolsillo a
cada familia estadounidense que paga impuestos un promedio de $3.400 al ao.
Se trata de un nuevo tipo de esclavitud. El trmino es apropiado porque
significa que se est obligando fsicamente a alguien a hacer algo contra su
voluntad, en beneficio de otro. Como descendiente de esclavos, eso es algo
que comprendo bien y que me convierte en abolicionista.

<h2>
MODERNISMO DESCONCERTANTE
</h2>

Walter Williams*
<p>

FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Tener 60 aos significa pertenecer a otra
generacin y tener problemas ajustndose a la vida moderna. No vivimos en
una poca donde el sentido comn y la responsabilidad personal se dan por
sentado.
<dd>	Hace unas semanas mi esposa me compr un mueble de madera sin pulir para mi
oficina, con la esperanza de que se viera ms ordenada. Como persona
razonable proced a leer las instrucciones en la lata del tinte para la
madera, antes de comenzar a aplicarlo. La etiqueta tiene la siguiente
advertencia: "No se ingiera". Y me pregunt, hay gente capaz de agarrar una
lata de tintura para madera y empinrsela? Alguien suficientemente estpido
para hacer eso seguramente no sabe leer. Por qu , entonces, tal
advertencia? Me imagino que los abogados de la firma fabricante temen que
alguien se tome el contenido y demande a la empresa, consiguiendo varios
millones con la decisin de un juez que la culpe por la estupidez del
demandante.
<dd>	Tambin est el asunto de la juventud estadounidense. Me he pasado la vida
adorando a los nios, no a todos, pero s a la mayora. Ahora los nios se
han convertido en mis enemigos. Los nios permiten ser utilizados como
herramientas de un gobierno entrometido. Apenas alguien habla de dar menos
dinero del gobierno para los almuerzos escolares, alguien se monta con un
nio en el escenario y grita, "pretenden matar de hambre a este nio
inocente!" Cuando se hacen esfuerzos por reformar la beneficencia pblica
haciendo trabajar a quienes sean fsicamente capaces de hacerlo, lo primero
que omos son gritos contra "los hambreadores de nios y madres indefensas".
Cuando los tiranos en el Congreso quieren restringir por la fuerza lo que
podemos ver en la televisin y en el Internet o prohibir a adultos que fumen
si les da la gana, de nuevo son los nios los que usan como instrumentos.
<dd>	Si los nios quieren recobrar mi cario y mi fe en ellos tienen que dejar
de ser utilizados como armas por tales granujas. Los nios deben convocar
una rueda de prensa y decirle a la nacin que si alguien quiere saber lo que
ellos piensan tienen que preguntrselo a ellos y no a quienes se han
autodenominado sus representantes y defensores.
<dd>	Otro problema de desajuste a mi edad es que no s tratar a las damas como
si fueran hombres. Cuando viajo en transporte pblico, suelo ofrecer mi
asiento a una seora, si no hay otro puesto disponible. Cuando camino por la
acera con una dama, tomo instintivamente el lado de la calle y le abro las
puertas que encontremos. Algunas lo ven como caballerosidad, mientras que
ahora otras se ofenden, sintiendo que trato de insultarlas. Cmo distinguir
de antemano a las damas de las mujeres?
<dd>	Adems est el asunto de las razas. Los expertos ahora dicen que la
patologa de la vida de muchos negros es el resultado de un legado de
esclavitud, segregacin y racismo. Por eso muchos jvenes negros no saben
leer ni escribir, prolifera entre ellos el delito y menos del 40% crecen en
un hogar con padre y madre. 
<dd>	Pero en 1950, cuando yo estudiaba en la escuela pblica Benjamin Franklin
del norte de Filadelfia, no sabamos de ningn nio que no supiera leer y
escribir. A partir de 1870, la mayora de los nios negros vivan en hogares
con su pap y su mam. Los barrios negros, incluyendo el vecindario de
viviendas gubernamentales donde yo viva, eran suficientemente seguros como
para dormir con todas las puertas y ventanas abiertas durante los meses
calurosos del verano. Cmo engrana eso con lo que dicen ahora los expertos
raciales en cuanto a que la esclavitud y el racismo son las causas de los
problemas actuales? La nica explicacin es que los efectos de la esclavitud
y el racismo saltan generaciones enteras, afectando a la de hoy, pero no a
la de ayer. Nada de eso suena muy lgico, no es verdad?&copy

<H2>LAS REDUCCIONES DE PERSONAL</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>



FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Una de las estrategias utilizadas por los que
quieren controlarnos la vida es inventar una crisis. Las reducciones de
personal por parte de las grandes empresas, que a menudo se denuncian en la
prensa, es un ejemplo de esa estrategia.<p>
	Pongamos tales reducciones en su perspectiva correcta, preguntando si ello
resulta favorable para el pas o si el gobierno debiera intervenir para
evitarlo.<p>
	Cuando naci este pas, 95% de la poblacin tena de alguna manera que ver
con la agricultura. Hoy apenas 2% labran la tierra. Tremenda reduccin de
personal, pero ha resultado malo para la nacin? Ha debido el Congreso, en
el pasado, tomar cartas en el asunto para evitar la prdida de puestos en el
campo?<p>
	Aos atrs, la construccin pesada, de ferrocarriles, carreteras, represas,
puentes y tneles requera cuadrillas de hombres con palas y picos. Hoy,
unos pocos y muy bien pagados operadores manejan inmensos y sofisticados
equipos, apretando botones y moviendo palancas, logrando hacer en un da lo
que cientos no lograban hacer antes. La tecnificacin de la construccin
destruy miles de puestos de trabajo. Qu ha debido hacer el gobierno para
evitarlo?<p>
	Son inevitables las reducciones de personal cuando las empresas encuentran
mtodos ms baratos de produccin. La mano de obra tiende a ser el elemento
ms costoso, por lo que hay incentivos econmicos para automatizar. Cuando
se utiliza menos personal, el personal sobrante encuentra ocupacin en otra
rea de la economa. Si no se hubieran logrado formas de ahorrar mano de
obra en la agricultura, de dnde hubiesen salido los trabajadores
necesarios para producir todos los dems bienes y servicios que han
contribuido a nuestra riqueza? Si el 95% estuviera todava ocupado en
producir alimentos, no habra tiempo para obtener la educacin y el
entrenamiento necesario para aumentar la productividad.<p>
	El ao pasado Wal-Mart contrat 41.000 nuevos empleados, Motorola 5.000,
Intel casi 10.000. De hecho se crearon 9,5 millones nuevos puestos en los
ltimo cuatro aos. Si IBM y AT&T no hubieran encontrado la manera de
utilizar menos personal, en dnde hubieran las otras compaas conseguido
los empleados? La alternativa hubiera sido que se dispararan los sueldos y,
por consiguiente, los precios.<p>
	En una economa robusta, dinmica y en crecimiento, siempre habr
alteraciones en el uso de la mano de obra. Unos puestos desaparecen y otros
se crean. La intervencin del gobierno en este proceso slo empobrece a la
nacin. Seramos ms pobres si se hubiese mantenido por decreto al cochero y
al vendedor de hielo.<p>
	Nada de esto niega que las reducciones de personal causan penuria,
especialmente entre los padres de familia que tienen que pagar la hipoteca
de su casa y vestir a los hijos. Muchos tienen que aprender otros oficios o
aceptar sueldos ms bajos. Pero una economa sana y robusta facilita esa
transicin, mientras que todo lo contrario sucede en economas con leyes que
"protegen" el empleo con toda clase de regulaciones.<p>
	En cualquier momento, la inmensa mayora est empleada. Debemos aceptar
que se debilite la economa, extinguiendo toda innovacin y progreso en
beneficio de un relativamente pequeo nmero de trabajadores que pierden su
empleo como resultado de adelantos tecnolgicos, cambios del mercado y
reestructuraciones de las empresas? Pienso que no.  <p>

<H2>LA FALACIA DE LA VENTANA ROTA</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Con cada leda de "Economa en una leccin",
escrito por el ya fallecido Henry Hazlitt, quedo ms impresionado por la
manera clara que este economista y periodista entenda los fundamentos de la
economa y con la agudeza de su ingenio.
<P>En el cuento de Hazlitt sobre la ventana rota, unos maleantes tiran una
piedra y rompen la ventana de una panadera. El panadero sale enfurecido,
pero alguien le dice que lo sucedido tiene su lado bueno. Los $250 que
cuesta reemplazar la vidriera le dar trabajo al cortador de vidrios.
Despus de todo, si las ventanas nunca se rompieran, qu sucedera con el
negocio de los vidrios? Al panadero tambin le recuerdan el efecto
multiplicador. El vidriero tendr $250 para gastar en otros comercios y
estos comerciantes gastarn a la vez ese dinero, continuando la cadena. Uno
podra entonces concluir que los maleantes lejos de ser una amenaza pblica
son benefactores de la sociedad.
<P>Hazlitt dice que la primera conclusin es correcta. El vidriero no va a
estar ms apesadumbrado por el vandalismo de esos muchachos que el dueo de
la funeraria por la muerte de alguien. Al panadero, sin embargo, le va a
costar $250 que pensaba ms bien gastarse en la compra de un traje nuevo. La
ganancia del vidriero va a ser a costa del sastre. Desde el punto de vista
de la comunidad, esta se empobrece por el valor de un traje que hubiera sido
confeccionado. Es fcil concluir que el vandalismo estimula la economa
porque se ver la nueva ventana, pero como el panadero no puede ahora
comprase el traje, el desempleo del sastre resulta invisible.
<P>Hay muchas maneras en que se nos engaa con diferentes versiones de la
falacia de la ventana rota. Algunos maestros ensean que aunque la Segunda
Guerra Mundial fue espantosa, nos sac de la Gran Depresin. No es as. Hubo
un incremento en la demanda por armamentos y Estados Unidos tena los
recursos para fabricar el equipo de guerra. Pero esos recursos hubieran
podido ser utilizados en fabricar casas, automviles y neveras.
<P>Una variante de la falacia de la ventana rota es cuando el alcalde, los
jefes sindicales y la cmara de comercio nos dicen que tenemos que gastar
dinero proveniente de los impuestos para construir un centro de
conferencias, un estadio o un puente, por los empleos que se crearan. Los
impuestos provienen de los contribuyentes. Si los contribuyentes no se ven
obligados a pagar esos impuestos gastarn su dinero en carros, muebles, la
remodelacin de sus casas y dems cosas que tambin crean empleo. As que al
igual que en el cuento de la ventana rota, algunos empleos se crean,
mientras que otros desaparecen o no se llegan a crear. La ventaja para los
polticos que fomentan el gasto pblico es que los empleos creados son
visibles, mientras los que se eliminan o no se llegan a crear resultan
invisibles.
<P>El Seguro Social es otra variante de la falacia de la ventana rota. Los que
apoyan el sistema se maravillan de los beneficios. No tienen idea cunto
mejor estaran si hubieran colocado ese dinero en planes privados de
pensiones. Entonces, entre los beneficios tendramos una tasa nacional de
ahorro superior, una tasa mayor de inversin, un producto interno bruto 18%
ms grande, segn algunas estimaciones. Todo eso es invisible, mientras que
los cheques del Seguro Social son visibles.
<P>Leer a Hazlitt lo convertira a usted en una persona mejor informada que la
mayora de los economistas.

ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
</h2>
Guillermo Yeatts*
<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El Congreso argentino est debatiendo el tema de los
hidrocarburos, con el objeto de convertir en ley el decreto presidencial de
1989 que desregul la industria petrolera, resultando en el aumento de 55%
de la produccin. Lo que se pretende evitar es que un futuro gobierno repita
lo ocurrido en 1963, cuando por decreto se cancelaron las reformas
petroleras instrumentadas por la administracin del presidente Frondizi en
1958. La historia de la actividad petrolera en la Argentina muestra
reiterados ejemplos de cmo los procesos aperturistas fueron neutralizados
por nuevas oleadas de intervencin estatal.
<p>
Lamentablemente, el nuevo proyecto de ley reafirma la propiedad del estado
sobre el subsuelo, lo cual no evitar que se repita la historia. Mientras el
estado sea propietario de lo que est debajo de terrenos privados seguir
siendo fcil regresar a la intervencin estatal y se le cierran las puertas
al desarrollo agresivo de las provincias pobres.
Por el contrario, las leyes relativas al subsuelo en Estados Unidos siguen
la tradicin inglesa: el dueo de la tierra es propietario de todo lo que
est encima o debajo. Esto significa que la riqueza encontrada en el
subsuelo le pertenece al dueo del terreno. Ello incentiva la inversin y la
innovacin tecnolgica.	
<p>
Mientras en Estados Unidos la industria petrolera ya generaba riqueza a
fines del siglo XIX, nada parecido ocurra en la Argentina, donde regiones
enteras con gran potencial petrolero quedaban en el olvido y la pobreza. 
La conexin fundamental que existe entre las instituciones y el rendimiento
econmico ha sido estudiada por el economista y premio Nobel Douglass North,
quien en 1993 escribi: "Las instituciones son las reglas del juego en una
sociedad o, ms formalmente, son las limitaciones ideadas por el hombre que
dan forma a la accin humana. Por consiguiente, estructuran incentivos en el
intercambio humano, sea poltico, social o econmico". La historia nos
ensea que cuando las instituciones crean incentivos positivos, la gente
acta de manera productiva y cuando las instituciones reprimen los
incentivos se contrae la iniciativa privada.
<p>
En el caso argentino, las instituciones heredadas de Espaa determinaron
que el subsuelo fuera propiedad del estado. Ya en el siglo XII, el rey de
Castilla se declaraba dueo de las riquezas minerales de su territorio,
tendencia que se acrecent a partir del siglo XV, con el descubrimiento de
metales preciosos en Amrica y simplemente lo que era del rey pas a ser de
la nacin. El Cdigo de Minera de 1886 reconoci la propiedad pblica del
subsuelo y la participacin del sector privado qued limitada a la forma de
concesin.
<p>
En 1865, apenas siete aos despus de que el negocio petrolero se iniciara
en Pennsylvania, en la provincia de Jujuy se gestaba el primer hallazgo de
este tipo en la Argentina. Leonardo Villa fue el empresario que intent
explotar el petrleo en forma comercial para cubrir las demandas del mercado
de kerosene para alumbrado pblico, tal cual estaba sucediendo en Estados
Unidos desde 1858. Pero la iniciativa de este pionero choc contra una
impenetrable muralla. Para comenzar la explotacin, Villa se vio obligado a
solicitar autorizacin a las autoridades de la provincia y luego al poder
legislativo nacional, lo cual, tras infinitos vaivenes, le fue denegado. El
estado, dueo del subsuelo, no permiti que el negocio se concretara. Igual
suerte corrieron otros pioneros hacia fines del siglo XIX.
<p>
Paralelamente, en Titusville, Pennsylvania, el negocio petrolero -iniciado
en 1858- haba alcanzado niveles insospechados. Contrariamente a lo sucedido
en la Argentina, el impulso de aquel grupo de visionarios que vio en el
aceite mineral una alternativa para reducir el elevado costo del alumbrado
no fue frenado por la intervencin del estado. La leyes de Estados Unidos
alentaron la inversin, la toma de riesgo y la innovacin tecnolgica.
<p>
Con el correr del tiempo, la intervencin estatal argentina se increment a
partir de la declaracin de zonas de reserva para la exploracin y
explotacin, el incremento de las regulaciones y, finalmente, la creacin de
Yacimientos Petrolferos Fiscales (YPF) en 1922. Los aos que siguieron
acrecentaron la voracidad de estado y restringieron an ms la limitada
participacin del sector privado. El nacionalismo econmico y su concepcin
del petrleo como recurso estratgico excluyeron casi completamente a los
particulares de la actividad, lo cual alcanz su punto mximo con la
nacionalizacin de los recursos energticos en la Constitucin de 1949. La
desregulacin de la actividad petrolera iniciada con los decretos de 1989,
si bien constituy un cambio radical dado que la produccin se increment de
27 millones en 1989 a 42 millones de metros cbicos en 1995, y liber el
comercio petrolero, no concret el cambio institucional de privatizar
totalmente este sector.
<p>
La mentalidad estatista conden a las regiones no agropecuarias a la
marginalidad y a la pobreza. Hoy en da, 80% del subsuelo argentino sigue
sin haber sido explorado. Lo que habra que hacer es proceder a un cambio
institucional fundamental, traspasando la propiedad del subsuelo a los
dueos de las tierras. La privatizacin del subsuelo acabara con el freno
artificial sufrido por la industria petrolera argentina por ms de 100 aos.

<H2>APRENDIENDO FUERA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD</H2>
Karl Zinsmeister*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Hace unos aos, el autor George Gilder escribi en el
anuario de Harvard que una vez terminados sus estudios se haba concentrado
"en un laborioso esfuerzo para redescubrir las verdades aprendidas de mi
madre mi padre y que desaprend en la universidad". De manera parecida, el
poeta Robert Frost dijo, en la conferencia dictada ante los graduados de
Dartmouth en 1955, que haba hecho un particular esfuerzo "de pasar por la
universidad mantenindome como soy para no ser cambiado completamente es
una pobre clase de persona, creo yo, la que se siente satisfecha pensando
'me han transformado en una persona que ni mi madre reconocera'".
<P>Se trata de importantes crticas a la educacin universitaria porque las
universidades no slo difunden conocimientos sino que tambin los destruyen.
Y las instituciones de altos estudios se sienten cada da con ms derecho a
borrar otros tipos de conocimiento.
<P>Alguna "deseducacin" es valiosa, especficamente aquella que destruye
falsos prejuicios. Pero gran parte de la variedad contempornea no va en
contra de falsedades sino en contra del sentido comn que ha evolucionado a
travs de la historia, lo mismo que contra nexos humanos naturales. En reas
que van desde el sexo, el lenguaje, la estructura familiar y las creencias
religiosas, muchos profesores se empean hoy en corroer las costumbres
tradicionales, rechazando juicios inmemoriales y descontando la sabidura de
los padres, extirpando las creencias fuera de moda.
<P>Dnde en el mundo acadmico de hoy se acepta la fe catlica, juda
ortodoxa, evanglica protestante? Y ni hablar de la mormona o musulmana.
Cun aceptado entre acadmicos es la creencia de la mayora de los
americanos de que hay diferencias biolgicas importantes entre el hombre y
la mujer? Cun tolerantes son las universidades de los puntos de vistas
mayoritarios en cuanto al crimen, la homosexualidad, la pena de muerte y el
servicio militar?
<P>Una reciente encuesta hecha por mi revista, The American Enterprise, mostr
que slo entre 2% y 6% de los profesores de humanidades en las mejores
universidades de Estados Unidos son republicanos. Adnde qued la amplia
gama de perspectivas y la discusin de puntos de vista antagnicos que las
universidades dicen patrocinar? Ms bien encontramos una vanidosa seguridad
y hostilidad contra las ideas "reaccionarias" que los estudiantes traen.
<P>El problema es que las universidades ejercen un monopolio en la educacin
superior y se sienten con el arrogante derecho de cancelar las verdades
intelectuales o morales aprendidas fueras de sus muros.
<P>En la universidad donde estudi, perteneciente al Ivy League (asociacin de
las ocho universidades ms antiguas y prestigiosas de Estados Unidos),
recib una menor exposicin a las obras clsicas de la literatura y la
historia de la que considero merecen recibir los estudiantes. Los temas
religiosos se ignoraban y no aprend nada til acerca de cmo crear un
matrimonio feliz, una familia y un hogar. Por el contrario, recib mucha
informacin contraproducente. Y si usted piensa que esos temas van ms all
de la esfera universitaria, recuerde que los sabios desde Platn hasta San
Agustn y Austen dedicaron el mayor inters intelectual a esos asuntos.
Lanzar a los estudiantes al mundo sin haber sido expuestos a la evolucin de
la sabidura en temas cotidianos es una grave falla educativa.
<P>No estoy predicando oscurantismo. El acceso a entrenamiento acadmico
formal es una gran cosa y obviamente es la misin principal de las
universidades. Pero debemos recordar que hay mltiples caminos hacia el
conocimiento y los profesores universitarios difcilmente tienen el
monopolio de la sabidura. Hoy los ms brillantes eruditos tienden a ser los
ms grandes crticos del mundo acadmico. El recin fallecido Allan Bloom,
traductor de Platn y de Rousseau insista que sus abuelos, quienes apenas
si saban leer y escribir, eran mucho ms sabios que sus nietos con
mltiples doctorados.
<P>Los estudiantes deben ingresar a la universidad con suspicacia en cuanto a
que las autoridades acadmicas representan la fuente final de la verdad. Y
deben balancear su educacin formal con una disciplinada educacin informal.
Si el entrenamiento personal y familiar es simplemente suplantado por la
educacin oficial, el resultado ser una comprensin deformada y falsa del
mundo, especialmente ahora que las universidades son tan "polticamente
correctas", izquierdistas y apegadas a lo que intelectualmente est de moda.
<P>Los estudiantes universitarios deben estar conscientes que en lo que tiene
que ver con muchos de los aspectos de la vida, su experiencia personal es
superior a lo que hoy ofrecen las lites letradas.

El bienestar econmico de una nacin se mide por el consumo
de bienes materiales. Los pases ms prsperos consumen ms alimentos, ms
servicios y ms bienes durables. Podemos, por lo tanto, afirmar que
bienestar es igual a desarrollo econmico. Y, desde luego, no se puede
con-sumir lo que no se ha producido, aunque no es indis-pensable producir
localmente todo lo que se va a consumir. Constantemente se intercambian
bienes producidos en el pas por otros producidos en el extranjero,
aumentando as la eficiencia. Pero los extranjeros no entregarn sus bienes
sino a cambio de otros, ya sea mediante el procedimiento arcaico del trueque
o la moderna transferencia de divisas. Es por lo tanto indispensable
producir para intercambiar. Consumo es igual a Produccin.
<P>Esto nos lleva a lo que llamo la ecuacin del bienestar: Desarrollo o
Bienestar = Consumo = Produccin. Esta ecuacin es vlida con independencia
del sistema econmico y poltico imperante. Es igualmente cierta para Angola
y para Alemania, para Venezuela y para Rusia, para Estados Unidos y para el
Japn.
<P>Podemos, entonces, afirmar que la nica manera de aumentar el desarrollo
econmico, el bienestar de la comunidad, es haciendo crecer el consumo a
travs de un aumento de la produccin. Y no existe otra forma de 
El Premio Nobel de la Paz Lord John Boyd Orr, en el prlogo de la edicin
de 1962 de la "Geopoltica del Hambre", afirm que dos terceras partes de la
humanidad estaban muriendo de hambre, tcnicamente calculada esa hambre en
razn del consumo de protenas, y que la solucin era la transferencia
masiva de recursos de los pases ricos de Occiden-te hacia el Tercer Mundo.
Afirmacin errada segn el proverbio chino, pero repetida durante aos,
hasta el cansancio, en todos los foros inter-nacionales y a travs de los
medios de comunicacin. 
<P>Resulta que en estos 34 aos los pases desarrollados han transferido al
Tercer Mundo, mediante ddivas o prsta-mos del Banco Mundial y del Fondo
Monetario Internacional -que jams cobrarn- la astronmica cifra de
$170.000 millones, sin que haya mejorado el consumo de protenas. Pero
seguimos oyendo y leyendo sobre la "injusta distribucin" de la rique-za
mundial.
<P>Esa transferencia de fondos del sector pblico de los pases desarrollados
al sector pblico de los pases subdesarrollados, a manos de gobernantes
casi siempre corrup-tos del Tercer Mundo, ha cumplido slo con la primera
parte del pro-verbio chino. Ha sido una transferencia masiva y astronmica
de fondos al mundo subdesarrollado, pero est muy lejos de haber sido
inversin en el sentido econmico. Ha sido capaz, eso s, de producir en el
mundo subdesarrollado una kleptocracia que se enriquece, una nueva casta
parsita de demagogos populistas que gana elecciones y por lo tanto tiende a
perpetuarse en el poder.
<P>Para que una inversin aumente la produccin, el bienestar y el desarrollo
de la comunidad, tiene que ser inversin privada, sometida a las reglas del
mercado y de la competencia, tanto nacional como internacional. Esa
inversin, cuando es extranjera, adems trae consigo una cultura industrial.
Con la inversin verdadera de capital extranjero se produce, adems del
traslado de fon-dos, el traslado de procedimientos productivos, de
entrenamiento de personal y de aplicacin de sistemas de produccin, de
tecnologa y mer-cadeo casi tan valiosos como el propio capital. Es esa
verdadera inversin un elemento indispensable para acelerar el desarrollo
econmico.

prctica esa legislacin no se aplica si no te haces "amigo del juez".
La ausencia de jueces confiables tiene consecuencias gravsimas para la
sociedad. Si en los juicios civiles es grave esa situacin, ms grave an se
torna en el caso de jueces penales porque los ciudadanos quedan sujetos al
llamado 'terrorismo judicial'.
<P>
 La ausencia de jueces penales confiables conduce a lo ocurrido en otros
pases de Amrica Latina, una tendencia a hacerse justicia por s mismo,
cuya expresin extrema son los llamados 'escuadrones de la muerte' que
proliferan por la desesperacin de la ciudadana ante la impunidad judicial
de los malhechores que regresan a la calle libres, pocos das despus de
cometido el delito. 
<P>
                  La falta de seguridad jurdica incide dramticamente en la
economa. No hay desarrollo econmico sin inversiones que nos hagan ms
productivos y no hay inversin sin seguridad jurdica.  Desarrollo econmico
y seguridad jurdica son un matrimonio indisoluble. 	
<P>
 La legislacin penal venezolana y especialmente el secreto sumarial son las
principales fuentes de la corrupcin judicial y hoy se ofrecen las ms
variadas soluciones, muchas de ellas no encaminadas a restaurar la seguridad
jurdica sino ms bien para lograr que los "reformadores" sustituyan a los
polticos en el nombramiento de los jueces.
<P>
 En primer trmino debemos modificar la constitucin. La Carta Magna
arrancada por el pueblo ingls a Juan Sin Tierra en 1215 es la primera
legislacin que permiti a los ms dbiles, al pueblo, limitar el poder del
ms fuerte, el rey. All naci la posibilidad de una cooperacin pacfica y
no forzada entre seres humanos diferentes. All tiene su origen la sociedad
moderna. Todas las constituciones deben tener por objeto limitar el poder
del ms fuerte, protegiendo al ms dbil. Deben limitar el poder de la
mayora protegiendo a la minora. Sin esa proteccin no son posibles la
cooperacin social ni la sociedad moderna estable. La sociedad moderna
permite la cooperacin de seres humanos marcadamente diferentes entre s
porque el poder del ms fuerte est limitado constitucionalmente en
beneficio del ms dbil.
<P>
 Pero en la constitucin venezolana tales garantas indispensables estn
mediatizadas con  frases como "salvo cuando... por razones de inters
social", dejando todo en manos de una mayora circunstancial cuando redacta
y aprueba leyes. Esa mayora no ha llegado a eliminar la propiedad privada,
pero ya algunos miembros del gobierno lo han insinuado. Y esa falta de
garantas reales atenta contra las inversiones extranjeras que consideran
que la seguridad de sus capitales estara eventualmente sujeta a la voluntad
de una mayora parlamentaria.
<P>
 En segundo trmino, hay que modificar el procedimiento penal. Muchos jueces
escogen la carrera para hacer uso del poder. Es como si le preguntramos a
los curas porqu han escogido el sacerdocio y nos dijeran "para or los
secretos de las confesiones y chantajear a los feligreses". 
<P>
                  El problema es que los jueces penales examinan, bajo
secreto, la presunta comisin de un delito y pueden privar de la libertad a
cualquier ciudadano. En Venezuela recluir a alguien en el Retn de Catia, en
Caracas, equivale a una sentencia de muerte. Es urgente, por lo tanto,
eliminar el secreto sumarial y limitar el exagerado poder de los jueces en
la legislacin actual.
<P>
 Otro grave problema es que en la legislacin venezolana los menores no son
imputables hasta los 18 aos. As vemos cmo mafiosos se aprovechan
entrenndolos para mandarlos a asesinar por contrato. Otro es la falta de
claridad en la definicin de delitos de difamacin e injuria perpetrados
contra personas jurdicas o sus marcas de fbrica, especialmente en
productos de consumo masivo, cuyas ventas pueden destruirse como
consecuencia de un proceso de difamacin o de falsa acusacin a travs de
los medios de comunicacin.
<P>
 El terrorismo judicial y la inseguridad jurdica que de ella se desprende
mantiene a Venezuela sumida en la pobreza y el atraso. 
 <P>

<h3>
<b>SENATE WELFARE REFORM BILL<br> 
FORGETS ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYSTS SAY<br></b></b>   
<p></h3><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUG. 29, 1995 --</b> The main welfare-reform bill the Senate will consider when Congress returns from recess all but ignores the most important reform issue -- illegitimacy -- according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">study released today</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
The bill proposed by the Senate's Republican leadership contains only one of eight anti-illegitimacy provisions that are part of a bill sponsored by Sens. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., according to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a>,  Heritage senior policy analyst for welfare and family issues.
<p>
"For weeks liberal Republicans have fought behind the scenes to prevent other lawmakers from even mentioning the harmful effects of illegitimacy. Now the Senate leadership bill finally mentions those harmful effects on society, but it does not take steps to curb them," Rector says. He believes the Senate leadership should adopt all the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft provisions. These include: 
<p><ul>
<LI>Requiring states to set voluntary 10-year goals for lower levels of illegitimacy and to draw up plans for reducing out-of-wedlock births.
<p>
<li>A federal bonus to states that are successful in reducing illegitimacy -- providing that abortion rates have not also increased.
<p>
<LI>Setting aside funds for abstinence education.
<p>
<LI>Providing a tax credit up to $500 for married couples with children with earned income between $8,000 and $26,000 where at least one spouse works.
<p>
<LI>Requiring mothers to establish paternity for children born after January 1996 in order to obtain future Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits.
<p>
<LI>Stop providing federal cash benefits to girls under 18 years old who have children out of wedlock.
<p>
<LI>Stop providing additional federal aid to women who have more children while enrolled in AFDC. States would be able to use their own funding if they choose.
<p>
</ul>
In a related study, two former policy analysts in the Bush administration's Office of Population Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agree that abstinence training should be part of the welfare-reform package.
<p>
According to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1051.html">Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle</a>, The Preventing Sexual Involvement (PSI) abstinence program conducted by Emory University faculty members is a perfect example of what the government can do to prevent illegitimacy.
<p>
A scientific study of PSI showed adolescents who went through the program were significantly less likely to initiate sexual activity than similar adolescents in a control group. In fact, non-program eighth-grade students were five times more likely to begin sexual activity during the school year than program students.
<p>
Piccione and Scholle recommend policy-makers:
<p><ul>
<li>Make abstinence counseling a part of comprehensive family planning.
<p>
<li>Give abstinence programs the same funding status as state and federally funded contraception programs.
<p>
<li>Promote adoption counseling where pregnancy has already occurred.
</ul>
<p>
"Abstinence programs must be part of a whole, unambiguous cultural message that promotes responsibility in all facets of life, including the sexual. Abstinence is the hallmark of responsibility. This message must be directed at both sexes and at all ages," they say.
<p>

<h2> Thousands Virtually Join Aspen Summit </h2>
</center> 
<p>

The leaders of Cyberspace gathered for the Aspen Summit '95 broke new ground today by simultaneously carrying on conversations face-to-face and on-line. The discussion among two hundred leading Cyberspace thinkers meeting at the Ritz-Carlton in Aspen, Colo., was carried to thousands on the Internet. 
<p>

"What we're doing in Aspen is trying to turn all the hype and cyberbabble into cybersense. While we brought leading  thinkers together in Aspen to work an a clear vision, we also involved the Cyberspace community itself,"  said <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Eisenach">Jeffrey A. Eisenach</a>, president of The Progress & Freedom Foundation which is hosting Aspen Summit '95.
<p>
On-line moderators posted real-time bulletins about the discussion in Aspen on the Aspen Summit '95 Homepage, while those logged onto the page posted comments that were shared with the participants back in Aspen. The Homepage received 6,032 hits during the days proceedings.
<p>
Monday was the first day of the two day Summit, and the Homepage will be in use again Tuesday 11:00 am to 7:00 pm EST.  To access the Homepage type: <a href="http://aspen.pff.org">http://aspen.pff.org</a>
<p>
"What we saw today in Aspen and on the Homepage was that the issues of how information technology is going  to change America are not confined to either the political right or left. People from diverse backgrounds are coming together to define a vision for what America can achieve in the Knowledge Age," said <b>Jay Keyworth, </b> chairman of the Foundation.

Tomorrow the Summit will continue with sessions on the Marketplace and Role of Government.  Among the 26 lead discussants will be: <b>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle </b>  (D-SD), <b> <a href="http://www.house.gov/ehlers/welcome.html">Congressman Vernon Ehlers </a></b>(R-MI), <b> Alvin Toffler</b>, author of <i>Creating a New Civilization</i>, and <b>John Gage </b>of  Sun Microsystems.

The Progress and Freedom Foundation is a non partisan research and educational organization dedicated to creating a  positive vision  of the future founded in the historic principles of the American idea.

<h2>"Aspen summit to explore cyberspace"</h2>
By Price Colman
<p>
<b>Conference designed to draft manifesto on sole technology will play in future society</b>
</center>
<p>
On the surface, the Ritz-Carlton in Aspen and Independence Hall in Philadelphia have little in common.  That could change if organizers of what's billed as "Aspen Summit:  Cyberspace and the American Dream II" see their vision become reality.  
<p> 
The Progress and Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C, - based think tank that is hosting the conference, has attracted a collection of America's brainest visionaries to Aspen with a plan in mind.  It hopes to draft a manifesto that will guide American society as it begins to probe the frontiers of cyberspace.  
<p>
"What we're trying to do is bring together those who see the potential of technology to work through what the future is going to be like,"  said Richard F. O'Donnell, spokesman for the foundation.  "We want to chart a path to show change can be good if we're smart.  If we think through where we're going, we can end up at better place than where we are today."
<p>
It's an ambitious mission, and the Progress and Freedom Foundation has lined up a panel of participants with intellectual clout.  
<p>
The participants inclued John Perry Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Steward Brand of The Well and Whole Earth Catalog fame, Phill Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, television and telecommunications visionary George Gilder, Microsoft genius Nathan Myhrvold, Bell Labs genius Arno Penzias and author and futurist Alvin Toffler.  
<p>
Sponsors of the summit include the Denver-based <a href="http://www.commerce.com/cnw/">Center for the New West</a>, a think tank financed primarily by U.S. West, Microsoft, the Reason Foundation, Intel, AT&T and BellSouth.
<p>
Participation in the summit won't be limited to big companies or famed Ph.Ds.  Anyone with a properly, equipped personal computer, or access to one, will be able to express views at this meeting of the minds aimed at drafting the operating principles of a new democratic digitocracy.
<p>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation has established a World Wide Web site --- <a href="http://aspen.pff.org">http://aspen.pff.org</a> -- permitting online participation in the four topics that will be featured at the summit.  The topics are the nature of property and freedom, the essence of community, the way of the marketplace and the role of government.
<p>
"The proceedings are going to be posted live real-time on the Net," said O'Donnell.  "People in cyberspace will be able to post comments about what's happening."
<p>
The Web site is operational now and accepting comments.
<p>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation may be best known for its sponsorship of the weekly cable television show Progress Report, co-hosted by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and for sponsoring the college course "Renewing American Civilization" that Gingrich taught.
<p>
But there's no partisan political agenda for the conference, O'Donnell emphasized.  
<p>
"We don't believe politically the left-right debate exists anymore," O'Donnell said.  "We think that debate is obsolete.  Americans no longer believe government has the answers.   We're trying to find a new paradigm.  We're kind of all over the map, just because we're trying to abandon the left-right debate."
<p>
As for the issue of why host such a conference in Aspen, O'Donnell offered a simple explanation.  "We wanted to do two things:  Get people away from daily routines to come and think," he said.  "The other thing is, Aspen's a great place to be in August."

<title>Press Release: Abolish DOT, Return to States</title>

<h3><b>DOT DUTIES CAN BE HANDLED BY<br>
 STATES, BUSINESSES, ANALYSTS SAY<br></h3></b>
<p><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 16, 1995  --</b> Congress should abolish the<a href="http://www.dot.gov/"> Department of Transportation (DOT) </a>and return its functions -- including the federal highway program, Amtrak, Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) -- to state and local governments or privatize them, according to a Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>
"Federal involvement in transportation on land, sea and air has become costly, bureaucratic and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees and unions that benefit financially from the status quo," say Dr. Ronald Utt, a Heritage visiting fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council, authors of the study.
<p>
As an example, Utt and Cox cite DOT's highway program, which "Congress originally intended to be a federally assisted state program to which more and more federal mandates and money have been added, making it a state-assisted federal program." As a result, "a $30 billion program with a 15-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now 30 years behind schedule."
<p>
Closing DOT and decentralizing or privatizing its mostly commercial functions would build upon "fundamental transportation reforms that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan administration" but stalled under George Bush and Bill Clinton, say Utt, former Reagan administration "privatization czar," and Cox.
<p>
The analysts recommend that the $20 billion Highway Trust Fund -- now used to pay for highway construction, urban mass transit subsidies, advanced transportation systems research and numerous other activities -- be abolished, and revenues from the 18.5 cents-per-gallon federal fuel tax that finance the fund become a block grant. Under such a scheme, each state would be free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs, according to Utt and Cox.
<p>
Also, a new Interstate Transportation Safety Office would assume safety regulation duties now managed separately by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), FAA and FTA.
<p>
 Utt and Cox recommend that Amtrak be terminated and its assets transferred to a new eight-state "Northeast Corridor Compact," which would seek creative ways to continue rail passenger service in the region. "Popular long-haul passenger routes should be privatized separately to take advantage of their tourism potential," say Utt and Cox.
<p>
The FAA would be split into three parts. "The air-traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation funded by user fees and ultimately privatized," the analysts say. Airport improvement would be restored to state and local governments along with the taxes and fees to fund the program.
<p>
Highway construction and maintenance would become state duties, while costly and burdensome federal labor and environmental mandates on construction projects receiving federal funds would end under the Heritage plan. A new federal highway cooperation office would be established to "bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states where needed."
<p>
Also, authority over the U.S. Coast Guard would be shifted to the Justice Department, while the Maritime Administration, with its $700 million-worth of Depression-era federal shipping subsidies, would be terminated.
<p>
Taken together in a DOT-closure measure, transportation deregulation would be to the "considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers and businesses," say Utt and Cox.

<h3><b>ABOLISH COMMERCE,<br>
 DON'T CREATE NEW TRADE DEPARTMENT, ANALYST SAYS</h3></b><p>
<br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 14, 1995 --</b> Congress should move forward with plans to abolish the U.S. Department of Commerce, but it should resist the temptation to create another Cabinet-level agency to handle international trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today. He called proposals to eliminate Commerce, while adding a new Department of International Trade, "a shell game."
<p>
Instead of playing this game, Commerce's legitimate duties in the trade area should be transferred to the Treasury Department, says economist <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/cobb.htm"> Joe Cobb.</a>
<p>
"The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet or sub-Cabinet departments," Cobb says. "Commerce cannot be reinvented. The department should be abolished. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be transferred to other departments. And its commercial activities should be privatized or closed," he says.
<p>
Creating a new Department of International Trade, which would include the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), as has been suggested by Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., and others, not only would be contrary to the goal of reducing government, but could harm U.S. trade interests, Cobb says. "It would diminish the USTR's effectiveness as a tough negotiator that speaks directly for the president in dealing with foreign governments," Cobb says. 
<p>
Transferring Commerce's trade programs to the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/homepage.html">Treasury Department</a>, Cobb says, would put them under "the government's principal officer for international economic policy," the Secretary of the Treasury.
<p>
On shutting down the Commerce Department itself, Cobb recommends that the department's inspector general be used to perform "the core of the transition work," that would either abolish outright, transfer to other agencies or privatize all of Commerce's more than 100 programs. Those programs create, according to the General Accounting Office, "a complex web of divided authorities" that shares "missions with at least 71 [other] federal departments, agencies and offices." 
<p>
Indeed, most of Commerce's activities, he says, "have little or nothing to do with its purported mission, which is encouraging the nation's international trade."
<p>
Among Cobb's detailed recommendations for abolishing Commerce:
<ul>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, Minority Business Development Agency, Travel and Tourism Administration, Office of Technology Policy, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and National Telecommunications and Information Administration;
<p>
<li>Transfer to other government offices the International Trade Administration, Bureau of Export Administration, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service and Patent and Trademark Office; and 
<p>
<li>Consolidate as a new, independent agency a combination of the Bureau of Census, the Economics and Statistics Administration and other federal statistical agencies.
</ul>	
<p>
"A Cabinet department reporting directly to the president of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies," Cobb says.

<h2> Washington Leaders in On-Line Cyberspace Summit  </h2>
</center>
<p>

<b> Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle </B> (D-N.D.) and GOP presidential candidates <b>
Senator Richard Lugar </b> (R-Ind.) and <b> Lamar Alexander </b> are among those joining in an on-line discussion on the Internet in the run-up to this weekend's Aspen Summit '95.
<p>
 Both the Internet forum and the Summit itself are examining the nature of the Big Change happening in America as information technology transforms notions of property, freedom and community,along with the workings of the marketplace and the government.  Four on-line discussion groups at the Aspen Summit '95 Homepage (http://aspen.pff.org) are underway, with both leaders and citizens engaging in debate.

<h3><b>1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT SOLVES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROBLEMS, ANALYST SAYS</b></h3>
Congress Never Sanctioned "Affirmative Discrimination"<br>
<p> 	
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, AUGUST 7, 1995</b> -- If Congress wants to assure all Americans  equal treatment under the law on the job, all it has to do is enforce the original intent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which "clearly forbids employment discrimination against either sex and against any racial or ethnic group,"  according to a former legal counsel for President Bush.<p>
	As part of this effort, lawmakers should forbid federal courts and regulatory agencies from imposing or encouraging race or sex-based "affirmative action" quotas or preferences, which are "alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII," says Nelson Lund, an associate professor at George Mason University School of Law writing in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/cbrief17.html"> Heritage Foundation special report</a> to Congress. 
<p>	"Congress never sanctioned the discriminatory conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under the rubric of 'affirmative action,'" says Lund. "In fact, group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute has claimed to advance." Rather, the system of  race-based preferences now in place was imposed by unelected federal regulators and rogue judges who took it upon themselves to interpret the "color-blindness" of Title VII in a perverse manner that developed into the very opposite of color-blindness. 
<p>	But it is not enough for Congress to proclaim now that it meant what it said 31 years ago. Congress should also prohibit "backdoor quotas" that discriminate through terms like "diversity," "inclusiveness," and "multiculturalism," according to Lund. "The existing cast of bureaucrats and corporate affirmative action officers should be forbidden from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under some new rubric like 'socially disadvantaged background,'" he says. "Any legislation adopted by Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination," he says.
<P>	Legitimate affirmative action programs that promote equal opportunity without relying upon or encouraging the use of race or sex-based quotas or preferences should be allowed to continue. This would ensure that "minorities and women are not excluded from employment opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate recruiting habits," Lund says.
<p>	Congressional action is needed, Lund says, because of President Clinton's recent decision to "strongly reaffirm the federal government's long-standing and thoroughly discredited approach" to affirmative action. That approach is easy to sum up, he says: "Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination, but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism for selected groups."
<p>	Clinton's position is also contrary to that of the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a think tank that has been supportive of the administration in the past but which recently suggested phasing out affirmative action programs in federal hiring and contracting, and making it voluntary throughout the private sector, except on college campuses. 
<p>	Yet, the Clinton approach has caused immense public controversy and outcry against affirmative action. For example, Lund cites federal court decisions holding, that:
<ul>
<li>	 A county agency could deny a promotion to a male and instead promote a less qualified female as part of an affirmative action plan requiring that 36.4 percent (the court-determined percentage of women in the county workforce) of the county's highway maintenance crews be female. This, "despite the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to seek jobs involving heavy physical labor."
<li>	 A fire department could deny a promotion to a white firefighter who received the highest score on a competitive exam and instead promote a black firefighter with a lower score. 
<li>	 A university sociology department could discriminate against male applicants for teaching positions because sociology has to be "considered a traditionally segregated field" as long as half the nation's population is women but only 34 percent of the sociology doctorates are awarded to women.
</ul><p>	Passage of legislation to put an end to such applications of the law "would extend the principle of equal treatment under the law to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by the 1964 Civil Rights Act," Lund says. "There is no longer any need nor justification for compromise, incremental changes or further temporizing" on the affirmative action issue.

<h3>
<b>CLEANING UP SUPERFUND MEANS<br> 
COMPLETE OVERHAUL, ANALYST SAYS<br></b></b>   
States Should be Given More Control<br>
<p></h3><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUG. 4, 1995  --</b>  As Congress prepares to reauthorize the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act (CERCLA), popularly known as "Superfund," it must correct fundamental flaws and not merely tinker with the statute, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.  
<p>
"Reform should address the core elements of the Superfund structure that fuel litigation, slow cleanups, raise costs and, most important, encourage the cleanup of sites that pose little risk to human health and safety, and divert scarce economic resources from sites that may pose real dangers," according to Environmental Policy Analyst <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/shanahan.htm">John Shanahan</a>.
<p>
Created by the Carter administration in 1980 to clean up the nation's worst hazardous waste sites, the Superfund program "has spent between $20 billion and $30 billion and has failed to clean up more than a small fraction of these sites," Shanahan says. "Even the Clinton administration admits the program does not work."
<p>
 Shanahan says Congress must make the following changes in the Superfund law:
<ul>
<li>Establish priorities for which hazardous waste sites pose the greatest risk to human health and clean up those sites first. "According to the Office of Technology Assessment, the listing of most Superfund sites is based on hypothetical rather than actual or likely future risks," Shanahan says. "The Superfund law aims at cleaning up spilled chemicals, regardless of  whether  these pose an immediate danger. The result: Money and effort have been squandered that could have been used elsewhere to save more lives."  
<p>
<li>Stop requiring waste sites to be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what the location. "Polluted soil at industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a level that makes it essentially clean enough to eat," said Shanahan. "An industrial park does not need to be as pristine as a playground. Once again, priorities must be established so public safety is maximized, while scarce resources are not wasted." 
<p>
<li>Get rid of Superfund's liability scheme, which is "designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste," even if the "responsible" person or party had only a tiny part in creating the waste problem, or disposed of waste in a manner that was legal at the time but which became illegal under the Superfund law, Shanahan says. In practice, this often means a firm with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created by someone else. "Naturally, any person or institution identified as a polluter has a strong incentive to show that others are liable as well, in order to spread the costs among more parties. Litigation is virtually assured," which consumes enormous amounts of time and money, delaying cleanup of hundreds of sites. Instead, Shanahan says, "Reform would make clear that liability is proportional to a party's contribution to the level of pollution at a waste site."
<p>
<li>Make hazardous waste cleanup a local, instead of a federal responsibility. "Unlike most all other major environmental laws, responsibility for Superfund is not delegated to the states. Yet, hazardous waste sites, are at their core, a local problem. State and local officials are far more accountable for local risks under their control than are distant federal officials," Shanahan says. "Authority for cleanup of hazardous waste sites should be turned over to the states -- with the necessary funding. To qualify for funds, states should be required to prioritize sites and expenditures based on real risks." 
</ul>
<p>
In addition to these reforms, Shanahan says the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> should retain emergency cleanup capacity. "The EPA is both experienced and relatively efficient at emergency responses to truly hazardous waste problems. Therefore, it should maintain this capacity, with states deciding whether a site constitutes an emergency. Costs would be recovered from the state or the party responsible for polluting the site," he says.

<title> Press Release: Privatizing Adoption -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WELFARE REFORM SHOULD INCLUDE<BR>
PRIVATIZING ADOPTION, ANALYST SAYS</h3>
<p></center><BR>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</B>
<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, AUG. 2, 1995 --</b> The only way for nearly half a million foster children to become available to more than 2 million couples who would like to adopt them is for states to take adoption away from the public welfare bureaucracy and give it back to the private sector, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"The $10 billion-per-year foster-care and adoption system in this country has become a major obstacle keeping thousands of children from being united with loving parents," says Heritage FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, a former family therapist and clinical psychologist, in a paper released today.  "The anti-adoption bias of the current public-sector welfare bureaucracy has resulted in an adoption process with too many built-in obstacles. These obstacles feed children into the foster-care system and keep them there, ensuring a larger clientele for public agencies, at a staggering emotional cost," he says. 
<p>
Yet, Fagan says, "Adoption benefits all involved. It increases the emotional, physical and cognitive capacities of children, and increases the life chances of the biological mother." What's more, if adoption is made quicker and easier, it will ease the burden America will feel by 2012, when a 50 percent out-of-wedlock birthrate is expected to vastly increase the number of abused and neglected children. "Serious welfare reform, therefore, must include serious adoption reform," Fagan believes.
<p>
Fagan says private adoption services are more efficient and effective than state agencies. "They are accountable to boards of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations can be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve." For these and other reasons, Fagan believes "The quickest, simplest solution is for states, which have primary responsibility for regulating adoption, to place the job of finding suitable parents in the hands of private adoption services. Both state and federal lawmakers can work in tandem to facilitate this process," he says.
<p>
While significant, Fagan says the tax credit for adoptive parents recently passed by the House of Representatives as part of its welfare-reform bill will not lead to a major increase in adoption unless the almost insurmountable barriers to adoption erected by the social service bureaucracy are removed. 
<p>
He says, for example, that a significant part of the reason only 1 percent of women choose adoption as a solution to their unwanted pregnancies is lack of information. "Some 40 percent of pregnancy counselors don't even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients; another 40 percent provide incomplete or inaccurate information about adoption," Fagan says. Yet, when adoption is mentioned, 38 percent choose it rather than alternatives like abortion.
<p>
Race is another barrier/bias in the adoption system, Fagan says. Even though a higher proportion of black than white children are available to adopt, and even though many white parents would like to adopt black children, the welfare bureaucracy is dedicated to a policy of "race matching," which delays adoption for years, and many times prevents black children from ever being placed in a loving home. This phenomenon occurs in the other direction as well, though not as often. As a result, "black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes." 
<p>
To fix these and other problems, Fagan suggests a number of reforms, the majority of which must take place at the state level. For example, besides privatizing all adoption services, he says states should:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for working out the long-term parental status of any child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Separate the responsibility for protecting children from convicted abusive parents from that of preserving parental rights for families that can be helped. "Professionals should not be trapped between simultaneous demands to reunite every family and to protect every child. When these duties are separated, both goals are better served," Fagan says.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child from foster parents willing to adopt him or her, except when the child is being returned to its legal parents.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Fagan says Congress should: 	
<ul>
<p>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay the substantial one-time costs incurred by adoptive parents. 
<p>
<li>Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal aid to provide timely and accurate adoption information to all mothers who give birth out of wedlock.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay placement of a child in foster care or adoption.
</ul>
<p>
Fagan's views are movingly reinforced in the latest issue of Policy Review, Heritage's quarterly journal, by "John," a baseball-loving 10-year-old who has been waiting almost his entire life for a family: "I'm all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom." John is quoted in an <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">article written by Conna Craig</a>, a former foster child and president of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Institute for Children.
<p>
"The problem," Craig says, "is a system that gives child welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted kids in state care, an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal and regulatory barriers, and a culture of victimization that places the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their children." State social-service agencies are neither rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes, nor penalized for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time, Craig says.
<p>
"As one foster child put it: 'Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having a mom and dad," she says.

<h3>BUDGET CUTS WILL END AMERICA'S<br>
 GLOBAL POWER, ANALYST SAYS</b><br>
B-2, NMD Funding Lauded</center>
</h3><p>
<br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 1, 1995 --</b> "America's days as a global military power capable of defending its worldwide interests will be numbered" if Congress goes along with Clinton administration defense budget cuts, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"If the president and Congress do not change course on defense budget policy, the result will be forces smaller than those needed to execute national strategy, a collapse of the strategy itself, and ultimately the exposure of America's vital national interests to foreign threats," says Baker Spring, Heritage's senior defense analyst.
<p>
"No amount of rationalization can cover up this cold, hard fact. New technologies will not save America from this disastrous outcome. Nor will new strategies that downplay threats to American interests," says Spring.
<p>
Spring says both the Clinton administration and Congress are at fault since there is only a $9.6 billion difference in total spending between their respective seven-year defense plans. "For all intents and purposes, the two are roughly the same," says Spring. "Both budget plans would reach the year 2002 with military spending levels that are less than 60 percent of what they were in 1985," he says.
<p>
Spring says Congress should establish a congressional staff study on how best to close the gap between projected defense budgets and actual national security requirements. The study group should be appointed by the chairmen of the Senate and House defense committees, and function like a similar 1985 body that produced a report on military reorganization.
<p>
The study's starting point ought to be that current military spending plans will result in Defense Department underfunding of at least $110 billion in a five-year period, compared to what would be required to pay for the force structure envisioned by the Clinton administration in its 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR), Spring says.
<p>
With the shortfall, U.S. military forces will have to be reduced even more than now planned, with the Army going from 10 to eight active divisions, the Air Force from 20 tactical fighter wings to 15, the Navy to 300 ships from 346, including only nine carriers rather than 12, and with only 140,000 active Marines, compared to 174,000.
<p>
So much military muscle will be cut that by the turn of the century the United States "will not have enough power to fight a major regional conflict like the Persian Gulf War without abandoning its security commitments elsewhere in the world," Spring says.
<p>
As an example, Spring cites the Air Force's deployment of 10 tactical fighter wings during the Persian Gulf War. Due to maintenance and backup needs, at least one-third of a wing is needed in reserve for each full wing in combat. This means putting just 10 wings in a future Gulf War would tie up the entire 15 wing Air Force of 2002, according to Spring. He says the same disturbing force calculus would apply to the Army and the Navy.
<p>
The weak U.S. military posture will also force America's allies to reassess their commitments to regional-based defense alliances, probably beginning with NATO, Spring says. "Under these circumstances, an independent European nuclear force, with Germany's direct involvement, is not out of the question," according to Spring. Japan could also be expected to either re-arm and fend for itself, or seek to play stronger regional powers like China and Russia against each other.
<p>
Finally, U.S. access to the international trade that undergirds much of America's economic prosperity would be seriously threatened, including the nation's access to critically needed petroleum supplies. "Two world wars in this century should have taught Americans that drastically scaling back our regional defense commitments is a dangerous thing to do," says Spring.
<p>
In related Heritage papers released today, Thomas Moore, Heritage's deputy director of foreign policy and defense studies, finds at least some encouragement in the Senate Armed Services Committee defense authorization bill, which will soon be considered by the full Senate.
<p>
The Senate bill would put the nation on course for building Theater Missile Defenses against short-range regional missile threats and a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the U.S. homeland against long-range strategic ballistic missiles. The bill also includes start-up funds for an anti-cruise missile defense.
<p>
Moore says proponents should expect and vigorously oppose efforts to drop the nearly $500 million in NMD funding increases included in the bill by the Senate Armed Services panel.
<p>
In a second related paper, Spring argues that the $356 million included in the Senate defense bill to pay for dismantling the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons should be used instead to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber production line open.
<p>
According to the General Accounting Office, these funds "have been used by individuals and institutions in the former Soviet states working to create new weapons of mass destruction." Funds would be better spent on the B-2, which is virtually invisible to enemy radar and thus will be able to project American power around the world from continental U.S. bases, Spring says.
<p>
Twenty B-2 bombers have already been paid for, but the Senate bill lacks a provision included in the House defense bill for spending $553 million to keep the aircraft's production line open for another 20 planes.
<p>
With the $356 million fund shift to the B-2, the Senate then can make up the remaining $188 million difference with the House by shifting non-appropriate funds supporting the Atlanta Olympic Games, weather reconnaissance, the Defense Business Management University, counter-drug surveillance activities and land mine clearing assistance, Spring says.

<b>FRIST DEMONSTRATES HOMPAGE, WELCOMES<br>
"TOWN HALL" TO INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY</b>
</center>
<p>
 U. S. Senator Bill Frist today welcomed the conservative movement to the information superhighway, and demonstrated his homepage at a Capitol Hill event to kick off the Heritage Foundation's Town Hall Internet community. Town Hall will provide Internet users with a link to conservative organizations and publications. Frist was the first Republican in Congress to have a homepage on the World Wide Web, and spearheaded an effort to bring the World Wide Web into the United States Senate.
<p>
"As a physician, I used technology every day to save the lives of my patients, and now as a Senator, I'm using technology every day to keep in touch with my constituents," Frist said. "It is imperative that our government be accessible through the World Wide Web, which is expected to have more than 100 million users within the next few years. With Town Hall and active participation by elected officials, the Internet can allow citizens to not only learn about, but become a part of the conservative movement."
<p>
In February, Frist asked the Senate Rules Committee to provide the Senate with access to the World Wide Web. Earlier this month, the Committee approved Frist's request. Senator Frist's homepage on the Internet includes his biography, Congressional Record statements, press releases, office information, and links to other government and non-political organizations.

<title>Time For a Bipartisan Reform of Public Housing - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>TIME FOR A BIPARTISAN REFORM OF PUBLIC HOUSING: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION</h3>

By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.<br>
Visiting Fellow<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1081<br>
May 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
<B>CISNEROS AGREES TO DESEGREGATE HUD HOUSING PROGRAM</B>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under the guidance of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in April 1996, HUD finally agreed to the terms of a settlement of a January 1995 desegregation suit (<I>Thompson vs. HUD, et al</I>., Civil No. MJG 95-309) brought against it by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several African-American families living at Lafayette Gardens, a decrepit HUD-supported public housing project operated by the Baltimore Public Housing Authority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, "The suit alleged that the city, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally segregated black public housing tenants for six decades, which the defendants deny. It said they would 'rebuild segregation for generations' and perpetuate poverty if allowed to redevelop the high rise sites as public housing."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In April 1996, HUD agreed to a $300 million settlement under which, among other promises, it would tear down several of the dilapidated, segregated public housing projects and replace them with 814 new, low-rise public housing units. Money earmarked for 150 of these units could be redirected to vouchers if Congress concurs. HUD also would provide vouchers to allow another 1,342 families to move into better neighborhoods. In addition, 664 of the proposed 814 new public housing units or vouchers could be made available for homeownership, partly under a resuscitated version of former Secretary Kemp's HOPE program. Traditional public housing is nowhere part of the court-supervised desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although in principle the settlement is a significant endorsement of the Reagan-Kemp empowerment policies of the 1980s, in practice the implementation details are remarkably coercive and would deny the winning tenants the right to exercise their choice in using the voucher.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Specifically, the assisted tenants, who are almost exclusively African-American, can use their vouchers only if they agree to move into a "non-impacted" area. In HUD-speak, non-impacted areas are defined census tracts, mostly in the surrounding suburbs and predominantly white in racial composition. In response to suburban concerns that the federal government will be forcibly relocating poor, inner-city blacks to their communities, HUD has established annual quotas under which the relocation program will be conducted. For example, only 60 black families per year will be permitted to move into neighboring Baltimore County in each of the next six years until the 360-family quota of African-Americans for the county is exhausted in 2002.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Although dramatic in cost and scope, the Baltimore settlement is not the first of its kind, and is not likely to be the last, unless Congress abandons its six-decade obsession with public housing.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<a name="ahs"><b>WHAT SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the perception within Congress is that there is a dearth of affordable housing available to the poor, the facts indicate otherwise. The table below, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, demonstrates clearly that a substantial portion of the U.S. rental stock is available at rents well within the range of the resources available to the typical HUD voucher recipient.
<p><center>

<tr  align="center">
<th>Total Occupied Units</th><th>	33,472	</th></tr></table>			
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	As the table indicates, there are 33,472,000 occupied rental units in the United States. In 1993, the most recent year for which such data are available, the vacancy rate calculated by the Bureau of the Census was 7.4 percent of the rental stock, roughly as it has been for most of this decade. This means approximately 2,674,000 additional units were vacant. Further, the number of affordable vacant units available from the private sector, estimated at 1.3 million units, is nearly equal to the entire stock of public housing units now in existence. With the private sector able to provide these units at rental rates below either the partial cost ($481) or the full cost ($935) of public housing, one is hard-pressed to explain Congress's long-standing bipartisan obsession with this failed approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It should be noted that the vacancy rate is higher, and housing therefore more available, within urban areas, reflecting the long-term depopulation trends within those communities as more and more Americans choose not to make their homes in cities. In 1993 when the overall vacancy rate was 7.4 percent, the rate inside Metropolitan Statistical Areas was 7.6 percent, while that outside MSAs was 6.4 percent. Thus, it should come as no surprise that 89 percent of voucher recipients are able to find suitable, qualified, affordable rental housing from the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The claimed shortage of affordable housing is one of the more popular rationales used by the public housing industry and its defenders to justify pouring billions of dollars into renovation, modernization, and new construction. Indeed, so great is this obsession that for years Congress has forbidden HUD to tear down any public housing unit, no matter how dilapidated, unless it first agrees to replace it with a new unit. Although both the House and the Senate propose to repeal this absurd and long-standing restriction, apologists for public housing still go to great lengths to misconstrue the actual state of affairs, as the House Banking Subcommittee report demonstrates with its creative interpretation of a GAO finding. On the matter of affordability and availability, the GAO says that:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Generally, the lower the vacancy rate in an area, the more difficult it will be for assisted households to find alternative housing. In the New York City housing market, for example, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, the vacancy rate is less than half the national average, making alternative housing more difficult to find.<sup>3</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Seven months later, the House Subcommittee on Housing had this to say on the same matter in a paragraph referencing the GAO's findings:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also, for vouchers to succeed, housing must be available, and availability is very much market specific. For example, the vacancy rate in markets such as New York City, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, is less than one half the national rate. Providing a voucher in this area would be useless.<sup>4</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Despite the difficulties that more than 50 years of rent control and rent stabilization have created for the New York City rental housing market, it is significant that HUD has a 62 percent success rate with vouchers and certificates.<sup>5</sup>

<title>A Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch - Heritage</title>

<h3>A REPUBLICAN AGENDA TO REVERSE THE CLINTON CRUNCH</h3>

<b>By <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Dick Armey</a></b>
<P>Dick Armey is Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives and represents the 26th district of Texas.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on February 27, 1996.

<P>
Can you believe that, in his State of the Union speech, President Clinton actually said "our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades"? I have to say, President Clinton is the Herald of Happy Talk, but this is what my wife Susan calls denial.
<table border=0 align=left>
<tr><td><img src="flnrarmy.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><th>Majority Leader Armey and Heritage<br> President Edwin Feulner</th></tr></table><p>
Only last week Alan Greenspan called the current economy "dismal." The Administration admitted as much when it announced that the economy grew less than 1 percent annually last quarter. This White House is quickly bringing back Jimmy Carter's economic malaise, but now they're calling it a funk.
<p>
The last two years of the Carter presidency were the worst for family incomes since the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan brought families back to prosperity with tax cuts, deregulation, good humor, and optimism. But Bill Clinton is bringing us a return of the middle-class squeeze.
<p>
Millions of working American families gather around their kitchen tables at the end of a hard work week and wonder why it is they can't seem to make ends meet. They work longer and longer hours, they take second jobs, but they feel they are just running in place. They are losing their faith in the American Dream: that their sons and daughters will achieve a higher living standard than their parents and grandparents.
<P>


I lay the blame for America's anxiety at the feet of this Administration. Here's the evidence:
<ol><p>
<li> In each and every year of the Clinton presidency, the typical American family had less real income than when President Clinton took office. Last year alone, the typical family earned $790 less than in 1992.
<P>
<li> The President enacted the largest tax increase in history, and the result is that the typical family now devotes 24.5 percent of its income to federal taxes -- a greater share of income than at any time in America's peacetime history.
</ol><p>

<b>Higher Taxes, Lower Incomes</b>
<p>
These two factors combine to make up the Clinton Crunch: taxes going up and incomes going down. If, instead, families had continued to prosper as they did during the Reagan expansion, the average family would have had $1,274 more last year.
<p>
Republicans want to reverse the Clinton Crunch. We want incomes to go up while taxes go down. Republicans want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn.
<p>
But this Administration would rather feel your pain than deal with it. Secretary Reich, for example, recites the Democrat mantra that real wages for the median worker have fallen 4.6 percent since 1979. He's just reciting the time-worn Democrat party line.
<p>
Income certainly hasn't fallen steadily since 1979. As President Carter completed his term, the nation plunged into recession and wages plummeted. But wages and incomes rebounded during the Reagan expansion years. Tragically, just as families had nearly regained their pre-Carter standard of living, the Democrat Congress and the Bush Administration stalled their forward progress, and now the Clinton Crunch has knocked families backwards.
<p>
What's the lesson here? The only period of sustained wage growth in the last 17 years came as government was cutting taxes and paring back red tape.
<p>
President Clinton didn't just ignore the lessons of history; he defied them. He enacted the largest tax increase in the nation's history and piled on new regulations. It's no wonder that more than half of the wage decline since 1979 occurred under Clinton's watch.
<p>
This Administration and the Democrats think the answer is more government, higher taxes, and more regulation. The President even wants to add new obstacles like a minimum wage hike -- putting the bottom rung of the economic ladder of success out of reach for millions of unskilled workers. The President says he wants to decrease the number of working poor. The trouble is he would do it by making the working poor the non-working poor.
<p>
<b>Bill Clinton: Last Defender of the Welfare State</b>
<p>
In a classic Clinton disconnect, Bill Clinton said that the "era of big government is over," but his actions make it clear that he is the last defender of the welfare state. He stands alone against the tide of reform and renewal rising throughout America.
<p>
More jobs were created in the last six months of the Bush Administration than in these past six months of the Clinton Administration. Bill Clinton inherited a growing economy and quickly trampled prosperity. But that's not all.
<p><ul>
<li>He vetoed the first balanced budget in 26 years.
<li> He vetoed tax cuts for working America and for economic growth.
<li> He vetoed regulatory relief that would have eliminated excess red tape that stifles wages. 
<li>He vetoed legal reform that would have stopped expensive, frivolous lawsuits. 
<li>He vetoed welfare reform that required work and discouraged illegitimacy.
</ul><p>
 Bill Clinton desperately wants to preserve the status quo. He and too many technocrats in Washington are willing to resign this nation to sluggish growth and limited opportunity. We can't settle for that kind of mediocrity.
<p>
But I'm here to bring you good news. Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch. We must revive prosperity so that working people can once again earn more and keep more of what they earn.
<p>
I have a favorite saying that makes a serious point about the American Dream and why economic growth is the most important goal of Republican policy. Very simply put, every parent knows, deep down, that the American Dream isn't just owning your own home; it's getting your kids out of it.
<p>
Think about it. We struggle through parenthood, sharing our children's hopes and joys and getting them through their disappointments. We're rewarded for all our hard work on that magic day when they burst through the door and say, "Mom, Dad, I got the job." It takes economic growth to create those jobs for our kids so they can start their lives, get married, and finally give us old folks the grandkids we so desperately want to spoil.
<p>
<b>Reversing the Clinton Crunch</b><p>
This is the American Dream, imperiled by the Clinton Crunch. House Republicans have a 9-point <b>Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch</b>:
<p><ol>
<li> Cutting taxes on investment to create jobs; 
<li> Tax relief for working farnilies with children; 
<li> Protecting pensions for working Americans; 
<li> Streamlining regulations that stifle wages and increase prices; 
<li> Reforming the health insurance market to eliminate job lock; 
<li> Putting power in the hands of workers, not bureaucrats, by consolidating worker training programs;
 <li>Enforcing the <i>Beck</I> decision to end the coercive hidden tax that forces union workers to support partisan politics; 
<li> Voting on a tax limitation constitutional amendment to let you keep more of what you earn; and
<li>Continuing our success in eliminating wasteful government spending to use tax dollars wisely and move power back to the states.
</ol><p>
<b>Step 1: The first major step in restoring growth and easing the Clinton Crunch is tax relief.</b> We must cut taxes on investment to get the economy moving again. <b>This year, I am confident we can and will develop a capital gains tax cut that this President can sign</b>. We need capital gains  tax relief so that investment can flow from the stagnant industries of yesterday to the start-up firms of tomorrow, so that a person with a great idea today becomes an employer tomorrow.

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> We will continue to pursue a child tax credit. When Democrats started their 40-year run as the majority in Congress, the average family paid $1 to the federal government for every $50 they earned. Today, the average family pays $12 to the federal government for every $50 earned. It's time to turn that trend around.
<p>
To  appreciate fully how big the federal tax bite is, I propose that you take the Armey Challenge. Look at your paystub every month, for as many months as it takes, and see if you are paying more for taxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined. Too many of you will find that government-costs you more than the necessities of life. And that is wrong! <b>We will, again this year, give the President an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut.</b>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> One of the largest sources of investment funds today is the pension and retirement savings millions of Americans set aside each year. Pension managers, wanting to get their investors the highest return, seek out the best investments. It's a win for savers, who earn a higher return; for borrowers, who can start or expand their businesses; and for workers, when new jobs are created. But Secretary Reich wants to pre-empt that synergy. He wants the government to choose "winners" and "losers" by redirecting pension funds into "social investment.'' That means lower returns for future retirees, and less investment funds available to start real, productive businesses that create jobs and opportunities. <b>The House passed Jim Saxton's H.R. 1594 last vear to stop Reich's pension grab. I'll ask Senator Dole to move this bill through the Senate so we can send it to the President this year.</b>
<P>
<b>Step 4:</b> Outdated regulations force employers to spend money investing in Washington paperwork instead of productive equipment -- and paying lawyers instead of giving raises to workers. We'll restore wage growth by eliminating unnecessary and job-destroying government regulation. Cutting excess red tape creates more jobs and higher wages, and lowers prices for consumers. <b>In March. the House will pass a regulatory reform bill H.R. 994, designed by Representatives Bill Clinger and Henry Hyde, updating the Regulatory Flexibility Act and requiring Administration review of old regulations</b>. We expect the legislation to be on the President's desk this spring.
<p>
<b>Step 5: In April, the House will vote to end health insurance job lock</b>. Today, too many working parents are afraid to pursue new opportunities, start a new career, or become an entrepreneur because they don't want to lose the health insurance they now have. This year we will bring up legislation centered around Representative Bill Thomas's H.R. 1610 to increase the availability, affordability, and accountability of health care coverage for working families.
<p>
<b>Step 6:</b> Federal job training programs today train workers for jobs that no longer exist. They erect barriers rather than bridges between aspiring workers and the jobs they seek. <b>The House and Senate this year will complete work on Representative Bill Goodling's CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)</b>, which takes control away from bureaucrats, who are in no position to know where the jobs are, and puts it in the hands of workers searching for training.
<p>
<b>Step 7:</b> The Supreme Court's 1988 <I>Beck</I> decision, which declared that union members cannot be forced to pay dues to pay for anything other than collective bargaining costs, today remains unenforced. As a result, union households are forced to pay dues to support partisan advocacy that violates their core political beliefs. In the <I>Beck</I> case, 79 percent of union dues funded activities other than collective bargaining, including overt partisan political activity. As Thomas Jefferson said, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." <b>This year, the House will bring legislation to the floor to end this hidden tax</b>. We must give union families control over how their hard-earned income is spent and restore their right to advocate their own political beliefs.
<p>
<b>Step 8:  On April 15, the House will vote on a constitutional amendment to limit tax increases</b>. The tax limitation amendment puts an end to the cycle of the past 40 years -- special interests in Washington demanding more spending, and Congress raising taxes to pay for it.
<p>
The American people know that cutting spending is the only way to get our fiscal house in order and balance the budget. Economists from all parts of the political spectrum agree that balancing the budget would bring interest rates down by nearly 25 percent -- or 2 percentage points. That means entrepreneurs and small businesspeople can better afford to start and expand firms, hire more workers, and invest in new equipment to boost productivity and wages. And a 2 percentage point reduction in interest rates translates into $1,300 per year in interest savings for a typical family with a home mortgage, a car loan, and student loans.
<p>
<b>Step 9:</b> Finally, we will continue this year to cut wasteful government spending. Two economists I hold in very high regard, Lowell Galloway and Richard Vedder of Ohio University, have done extensive work on the optimal size of government. Their research confirmed what I like to call the Armey Curve. It showed that government spending, up to about 18 percent of the economy, can have a positive impact. But beyond that point, Keynes is wrong -- more government isn't a stimulus; it's an obstacle to growth.
<p>
Today, federal spending approaches 22 percent of the economy. Clearly, there's ample
room to cut. In fact, Vedder and Galloway estimate that each dollar of federal spending restraint
increases private sector spending by $1.38. <b>In plain English, cutting wasteful government
stimulates growth and creates jobs</b>. Since Republicans became the majority in Congress, we put
government on track to cut federal spending by $50 billion this year and last. But that's only a
beginning. This year, we will again cut spending and return power to the states to give the
taxpayers more bang for their buck.
<p>
<b>A New Vitality for America</b>
<p>
This Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch will create a new vitality in our nation. Every family once again will have the opportunity and the freedom to pursue the American Dream so that our sons and daughters can always achieve a higher standard of living than their parents and grandparents. A rising tide of prosperity will lift the fortunes of all Americans --  unless President Clinton keeps us tied to the moorings of big government, as he did last year.
<p>
America faces a momentous choice this year as we decide which of two paths this nation will follow into the next century. Republicans believe we must pursue freedom so that families can earn more and keep more of what they earn. We must put our faith in the ingenuity and goodness of the American people, rather than the guile of the government, to get this country back on track. Ronald Reagan's return to freedom ushered in an era of historic prosperity in this nation. The President would take us down the other path -- the path of the stifling, big-government status quo.
<P>
It is outrageous for an Administration that stifled job creation by hiking taxes to lament joblessness. It is outrageous for those whose red tape choked off raises for working men and women to decry falling wages. The President and other liberals in Washington have the gall to blame Americans for the Clinton Crunch. <b>And it is wrong</b>.
<p>
The "blame Americans" strategy will not work. False promises won't alleviate anxiety about what the future holds. Public hand-wringing will not rekindle our national optimism. Angry words will not create jobs. And class warfare demagoguery will not relieve the Clinton Crunch. 
<p>
America's anxiety will ease only as individual families witness and experience success. Republicans have an agenda to rekindle that success, while the President has only empty rhetoric. It's not enough to say "I feel your pain" when you're the one causing it. The President must accept responsibility for his actions.
<p>
Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch by relieving the burden of taxes and big government.  Our program will restore faith in the American Dream as families, one by one, prosper through freedom.

          achieve their egalitarian purpose.  However, in the
          process significant economic disincentives and
          inefficiencies are introduced which reduce growth and
          fairness.  Consequently, a flat-rate may be a

Paul, Ron. 1982.  "The Flatter the Better?"  <i>Inquiry</i> (September),
     pp. 29-33.
<blockquote>
          Prominent libertarian (he was the Libertarian Party's
          presidential candidate in 1984) strongly favors a flat-
rate tax because "it would spread the burden of paying
          for government more evenly, foreclosing once and for
          all the illusion that the burden can be placed on the
          shoulders of the rich.  By shifting the tax burden
          toward the political center, any flat-rate tax would
          increase pressure for less government taxing and
          spending."  Contrast with Rothbard.

(Updating Asian Studies Center <a href="asc139.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 139</a>, "China's Threats to Taiwan Challenge U.S. Leadership in Asia," March 6, 1996)
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Early in the morning of March 8, China fired three nuclear-capable missiles into two areas close to the Republic of China on Taiwan as part of missile "tests" that will last until March 15. Moreover, from March 12 to March 20, China will hold large-scale naval military exercises that use live ammunition, also in an area close to Taiwan. These military actions are targeted at the ROC's March 23 presidential election and mark an escalation in Beijing's campaign to intimidate the citizens and leadership of democratic Taiwan. Beijing has designed the missile tests to emphasize China's ability to blockade Taiwan. The three missiles fired on March 8 fell into two zones astride Taiwan's two largest ports, and Beijing has warned commercial air and sea traffic to steer clear. The tests threaten both Taiwan's economic well-being and the safety of its citizens. They also stand as test of Washington's leadership and resolve, and challenge America's historic interest in maintaining freedom of the seas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's March 10 decision to dispatch U.S. Navy aircraft carrier groups to waters near Taiwan to deter possible Chinese escalation was correct. Congress's response to these latest threats against Taiwan also has been strong. Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, said they amounted to "an act of terror."  But while State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns called the missile tests "reckless and potentially dangerous," another State Department official told <I>The New York Times</I> the tests did not amount to an act of terror. Washington should protest China's missile intimidation in the strongest terms, reaffirm America's commitment to defending freedom of the seas, review U.S. commitments to Taiwan as stipulated in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and accelerate the introduction of U.S. missile defense systems into Asia.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S MISSILE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN TAIWAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China is the only Asian country using nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate its neighbors. The tests which will last from March 8 to March 15 mark the second time China has employed missiles to threaten the people of Taiwan. Last July 21 to 26, China launched four 1,125-mile-range DF-21 missiles and two 375-mile-range M-9 missiles into an area roughly 90 miles north of Taiwan. Both the DF-21 and the M-9 are designed to carry conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads. So far, the M-9 has been used in the latest tests, which target two areas of roughly 500 square miles each. One target area is located about 30 miles off the northern coast of Taiwan, east of the port of Keelung. The second is 47 miles directly west of the southern port of Kaohsiung.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Clear Escalation of Tension.</b> The new missile tests mark a clear escalation in China's pressure against Taiwan. The location of the northern target area raises the possibility that Chinese missiles may fly over Taiwanese territory, possibly even the capital city of Taipei. The failure of one M-9 missile in last July's exercise also raises the danger of an accidental strike on Taiwan. Moreover, the March tests follow months of threats. For example, during an early 1996 trip to China, former Clinton Administration Pentagon official Charles Freeman reportedly was told that China "has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As also occurred in July, the current tests are taking place alongside large-scale Chinese ground and naval exercises in areas near Taiwan. The latest exercises have featured practicing the largest airborne assault ever conducted by China, as well as a huge amphibious exercise aimed at Taiwan. And from March 12 to 20, naval exercises using live munitions will take place close to major air and sea routes in the Taiwan Strait.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Virtual Blockade.</b> These new missile tests and naval exercises amount to a blockade of major air and sea lanes critical to Taiwan's survival. The southern port of Kaohsiung and the northern port of Keelung account for about 70 percent of Taiwan's trade, and exports account for about 40 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product. Because of these tests, some shipping will have to be diverted. Moreover, about 30 flights a day that use routes near the northern test site will have to be re-routed. China's missile intimidation has damaged Taiwan's economy and threatens the economic confidence of the people of Taiwan. The March 4 announcement of the missile tests caused the Taiwan stock market to drop by 62 points the next day; the stock market has fallen 625 points since July 1995. The missile tests also have caused panic buying of gold, and the Taiwan government has had to reassure people that food and fuel have been stockpiled in the event of a blockade. Missile strikes or damage to shipping will further depress investor confidence and cause shipping insurance rates to skyrocket.
<P>
<b>TIME FOR WASHINGTON TO SHOW RESOLVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China's latest missile tests challenge America's interests in Asia. For over two centuries, the United States has defended freedom of the seas and stood for freedom of commerce. Indeed, these principles have been at the heart of America's open door approach to Asia and China. By using its military to create a virtual blockade near Taiwan's two major ports, and forcing a diversion of international air and sea traffic, China is challenging an enduring and vital American interest. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's actions also stand as a challenge to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). Section 2 of the TRA states that "It is the policy of the United States to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States."  Section 3 directs the President "to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or economic system of the people of Taiwan.... " The tests also call into question the very basis on which the U.S. established relations with China: the assumption that Taiwan's status would be resolved peacefully by the Chinese themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Above all, these tests are a challenge to American leadership and resolve in Asia. For over half a century, the United States has stood as the ultimate guarantor of stability and security in Asia. Given the stakes involved, the Clinton Administration's initial response to China's missile diplomacy was tragically weak. The Administration offered only a mild rebuke to China's missile tests in July 1995. Responding to the announcement of the current round of missile tests, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns argues that it is not "credible" to describe the missile tests as a blockade of Taiwan's ports. The Administration has yet to be as critical as former Clinton Administration CIA Director James Woolsey, who said the tests amount to a "de facto temporary and partial blockade [which is] aggressive, indefensible, dangerous.... " The Clinton Administration should undertake a stronger response to China's missiles. The U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li>Strongly reject Beijing's use of military force. Since the U.S. is the only power able to deter China's threat to peace, the Administration should make clear to China that military action against Taiwan may undermine the basis for continued peaceful U.S.-PRC relations. The Administration should remind Chinese leaders that normalization of relations was premised on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status. The U.S. should tell China that its use of force against Taiwan threatens peace in Asia. 
<p>
<li> Reaffirm America's vital interest in the freedom of the seas. The Administration should inform China that its missile tests near Taiwan pose an unacceptable threat to internationally recognized freedom of the high seas and airways. Ships from the Japan-based 7th Fleet, now dispatched to international waters near Taiwan, should remain in this region after the March 23 election, both to deter China and to underscore U.S. commitment to freedom of the seas. The U.S. also should consult with Asian allies and friends regarding possible sanctions against Chinese sea and air carriers in the event the missile tests harm ships or aircraft.
<p>
<li> Report to Congress that China is posing a danger to Taiwan's economic system. These missile tests constitute an attempt to blockade Taiwan's ports and airports. They could presage a more deliberate attempt to blockade Taiwan. In accordance with the TRA, the Clinton Administration must report to Congress that these actions pose a threat to Taiwan's economy. 
<p>
<li> Sell Taiwan defensive arms consistent with the TRA. China's missile threats against Taiwan point to an urgent need for missile defense in the ROC. Thus, to enable Taiwan to defend itself against any possible missile attack, the U.S. should offer to sell the ROC the Patriot PAC-2 GEM missile defense system. This is the most modern operable missile defense system in America's arsenal. If China persists with its missile threats, the U.S. should sell Taiwan more advanced missile defense systems as they enter U.S. service. 
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's latest missile tests near Taiwan's two major ports are, for Washington, an unacceptable escalation in China's attempt to undermine the free and democratic spirit of the people of Taiwan. These threatening tests, combined with large Chinese naval exercises, also constitute a direct challenge to key U.S. interests, including the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future and maintaining the freedom of navigation in Asia. As the only nation capable of deterring China, the U.S. should strongly protest China's missile threats, reaffirm the freedom of the seas by deploying the 7th Fleet, and sell missile defense systems to Taiwan.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:
<P><ul>
<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.

Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?

<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid, the health care program 
serving the nation's poor, has transpired without adequate attention paid to the 
effect of the program on state finances. If significant reforms in Medicaid are 
not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the 
proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to the program. 
And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the 
rate for total state spending, the states will be forced either to increase taxes or 
to divert money from other programs, such as education and crime control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicaid is a state-administered 
program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments 
jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a 
statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower 
per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 
83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The cost of Medicaid to the federal 
government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid 
costs will almost double by 2002.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the financial impact on the 
federal government of generally unrestrained Medicaid growth is alarming 
enough, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless 
growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid that 
forces them either to raise taxes in order to maintain spending for other 
programs or to reduce state expenditures for non-Medicaid programs. States 
can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal 
rules requiring that certain levels of coverage (entitlements) be provided to 
certain populations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To examine the probable future 
budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend of 
total Medicaid spending using certain assumptions to forecast the state share 
of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002.<sup> 2</sup>  This 
analysis resulted in two sets of findings:  first, the additional costs to the states 
if no changes are made in the Medicaid program and, second, the additional 
costs stemming from President Clinton's proposed "per capita cap" reforms in 
Medicaid. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level 
Medicaid burden if Congress either does nothing or adopts the President's 
proposal. These projections of state spending incorporate expected changes in 
state economic activity, in the size of the eligible population, and in the trend 
of federal Medicaid transfers to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These forecasts of future state 
Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton 
Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally recognized 
economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 
47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between changes in 
historical Medicaid spending and fluctuations in the states' economic activity 
and Medicaid-eligible populations. In four cases, however, the relationship 
was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in 
spending; these states are North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming. 
<a href="cb22t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the 
states are to meet their projected Medicaid expenditures.
<p>
<b>Estimated Additional Costs Without Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Between 1995 and 2002, if no 
reforms are enacted that address the costs of entitlements and the composition 
of covered groups, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money 
on Medicaid. Total state spending over this period is projected to be $1,700 
billion, of which $1,011 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if 
CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between 
federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote 
an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among 
the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 17 percent of its 
revenues to the health care program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="cb22c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of 
state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 
1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. 
These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion 
by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid 
by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the 12-year period 
between 1990 and 2002. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some individual states will be 
particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $18 billion in 
new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 
1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $17.3 billion; Florida, 
$12.9 billion; Pennsylvania, $11.6 billion; and Texas, $7.2 billion. If these 
states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California 
will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $246 per year; New York, 
by $370; Florida, by $374; Pennsylvania, by $362; and Texas, by $177.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This rapid growth in the states' 
Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level 
Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes 
support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation 
infrastructure (see <a href="cb22c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state 
Medicaid spending to grow at a rate of 7.5 percent, while total state spending 
should grow at a 6.4 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid 
means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other 
state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will 
continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-
2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8.4 percent rate, while 
total state expenditures are expected to grow by an average of 5.8 percent.
<p>

<b>Fiscal Effects of the "Blue Dog" Democrat Plan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Democratic "Blue Dog" plan to 
reform the federal Medicaid program, the principal elements of which have 
been advanced by the Clinton Administration in its seven-year budget 
proposal, would increase the federal fiscal burden on the states by an 
estimated $47.4 billion over the next seven years. This new fiscal burden has 
been described as "one of the biggest and most expensive unfunded [federal] 
mandates ever"<sup> 3</sup> and, over the seven-year period 1996-2002, 
would amount to $4.4 billion in California, $3.7 billion in Florida, $3.4 billion 
in New York, $3.2 billion in Pennsylvania, and over $2.9 billion in Texas. 
Overall, this unfunded federal mandate would exceed $1 billion in 16 states. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First proposed by a group of 
Democratic House members earlier this year,<sup>4 </sup> this plan would 
further challenge the fiscal resources of the states by maintaining all the 
existing program mandates which the federal government imposes on the 
states<sup> 5</sup> while simultaneously reducing the federal government's 
contribution through the mechanism of a "per capita cap" on the federal share 
of the program. Under the "Blue Dog" plan, the per capita cap limits the 
amount of federal medical assistance that states would receive for each 
Medicaid recipient. Any expenses that exceed this limit would be the sole 
responsibility of state and local taxpayers. Because the full array of federal 
Medicaid mandates would remain in effect, states would not be able to offer 
innovative, and less expensive, health care options to Medicaid recipients. 
Overall, the per capita cap would shift an estimated $47.4 billion of mandated 
Medicaid spending from the federal to state governments over the next seven 
years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would probably respond to 
this shift in one of three ways:  1) enact dramatic tax increases; 2) reduce state 
spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other important 
state functions; or 3) some combination of the above. Indeed, the proliferation 
of Medicaid mandates during the late 1980s and early 1990s has already 
forced the states to reallocate their resources to Medicaid. According to the 
National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid spending has 
doubled from approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall 
state spending since 1987.<sup> 6</sup>
<p>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Heritage Foundation and 
Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic 
activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the 
additional funds states would need to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our baseline estimates assume no 
change in current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid 
transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this 
program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of the 
state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and 
economic change. We used this as the basic structure for future Medicaid 
spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These baseline forecasts of state 
Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher 
federal expenditures on Medicaid projected by the Congressional Budget 
Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) 
spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $58 billion over the period 1996 
to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each 
state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the 
seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would 
be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated 
by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of 
taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

<h3>UPDATED ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS TO THE STATES OF NOT REFORMING MEDICAID AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF ADOPTING PER CAPITA CAPS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br> 
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 81<br>
December 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

The Congressional Budget Office revised its seven-year projections of federal Medicaid outlays on December 12, 1995. CBO made these revisions in order to reflect how the effect of lower forecasted inflation will reduce the federal government's Medicaid obligations. These lower inflation numbers also reduce the additional revenues the states must find over the next seven years (1996 through 2002) in order to meet their Medicaid obligations. The accompanying <a href="fyi81.gif">table</a> shows The Heritage Foundation's revised estimates of these additional state Medicaid obligations.<sup>1</sup><p>
1) If no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations. This estimate is $27.8 billion less than the earlier Heritage estimate of $174.2 billion.
<p>
2) If the Congress and the Administration adopt the "per capita cap" proposal advanced by a group of moderate Democrats, the preliminary Heritage analysis indicates that states may need to raise an additional $47.4 billion in new revenues or spending cuts on top of the $146 billion increase. 
<p>
3) The total cost to the states of the current law plus "reforms" made on a per capita cap basis is likely to be $193.8 billion.
<p>
The projections of additional state obligations under current law were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. In these state-by-state Medicaid models, total Medicaid program spending is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. The baseline models were then adjusted to reflect CBO's forecasts of federal Medicaid outlays. Heritage's estimates of additional per capita cap costs are preliminary results of adaptations made to the baseline state models.

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
China's July 21-26 missile test about 100 miles north of Taiwan
was a blatant act of intimidation. Armed with nuclear warheads,
these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases
or naval formations in Asia, which lack adequate missile defenses.
China's attempt to threaten the Republic of China challenges the
United States to provide its forces and friends with appropriate
defenses. Unless America responds, China's future nuclear intimidation
could destabilize Asia by driving others in the region to seek
their own nuclear deterrent.
<P>
To avoid this, the U.S. should incorporate missile defenses into
its strategy to deter aggression in Asia. At the same time, Washington
should emphasize missile defense cooperation as an effective alternative
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's
focus on short-range, theater-based missile defense (TMD) systems
is inadequate. The Administration can enhance security in Asia
by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile
attack and extending that umbrella to America's allies and friends
in the region. Such a strategy should include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Building and deploying</B> a missile defense system for the United
States. In order to defend its allies, America itself must
be defended from missile attack.
<P>
<LI><B>Improving</B> the defense of U.S. forces in Asia by accelerating
development and deployment of the Navy's Upper Tier system to
the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD system to U.S. forces in
South Korea and Japan.
<P>
<LI><B>Encouraging</B> Australia, Japan, and South Korea to acquire
advanced U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense
cooperation.
<P>

<b>ASIAN MISSILE THREATS AND PROLIFERATION DANGERS</b>
<P>
<B>China's Global and Regional Threat. </B>China's nuclear missile
program dates back to the mid-1950s and has grown to include several
classes of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. China is believed
to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. <sup>1</sup> By
the year 2120, according to one estimate, China could have 50
to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching
the United States from bases in China. <sup>2</sup>  Two mobile ICBMs are under
development  the 5,000-mile-range DF-31 and the 7,500-mile-range
DF-41. The DF-31, tested on May 29, 1995, could reach the Western
U.S. if fired from Northern China. China deploys four DF-5 missiles
which can carry a 4 to 5 megaton warhead over 8,000 miles and
10 DF-4 missiles with a 3,000-mile range. China has one to two
nuclear missile submarines which can carry 12 of the 1,000-mile
Julang-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The 5,000-mile-range
<I>Julang-2</I>, a variant of the DF-31, is under development.
<P>
China also possesses several intermediate-range and tactical nuclear-capable
missiles. Since the mid-1980s it has build over 30 DF-21 missiles
with a 1,125-mile range. It also may have more than 60 older and
less accurate DF-3 1,700-mile-range missiles. Chinese nuclear-capable
tactical missiles include the 185-mile-range DF-11 (M-11) and
the 375-mile-range DF-15 (M-9). According to Chinese military
analyst Dr. Chong Pin Lin, China has hired Russian technicians
and may have purchased a complete missile plant from Russia, to
produce long-range cruise missiles similar to the U.S. <I>Tomahawk.</I> <sup>3</sup>
 China is developing Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) that
emit precise navigation signals. With such a capability, Chinese
ballistic and cruise missiles could acquire high degrees of accuracy. <sup>4</sup>

<P>
In 1993 China reportedly purchased 60 Russian S-300s, comparable
in capability to the U.S. Patriot missile, which can intercept
tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Russian Scud, in flight. <sup>5</sup>
 Thus, China already has a limited anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) capability.
<P>
China's nuclear strategy against the United States and Russia
is often described as one of &quot;minimum deterrence,&quot; targeting
its small number of ICBMs on U.S. or Russian cities. However,
Beijing clearly employs a more active strategy with its intermediate
and tactical missiles. The &quot;testing&quot; of DF-21s and M-9s
near Taiwan was China's first high-profile use of missiles to
intimidate an opponent. The M-9 missiles were fired from Leping
Military Base in the Jaingxi Province west of Taiwan; Taipei is
just at the edge of the M-9's 370-mile range from this base. <sup>6</sup> 
DF-21 missiles are deployed from bases where they can threaten
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. <sup>7</sup>
 With the assistance of PLA Navy tracking ships, DF-21 missiles
also could be used to attack U.S. Navy carrier task groups. From
China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, DF-21 missiles could
counter U.S. naval forces transiting the Straits of Malacca.
<P>
<B>North Korea's Current and Future Threat. </B>North Korea's
extensive missile program is often overshadowed by its nuclear
weapons development program. <sup>8</sup>  But its ballistic missile program
deserves equal attention. It was revealed in 1994 that North Korea
was developing two long-range missiles, dubbed the Taepo Dong-1
&amp; 2 with estimated ranges of 1,200 miles and 2,000 miles,
respectively. These missiles would give North Korea the capability
to target U.S. forces in Guam. According to recent South Korean
and Russian estimates, the Taepo Dong-2 could have a 6,200-mile
range, which would cover about half the continental U.S. <sup>9</sup>  At this
estimated range, the Taepo Dong-2 also could reach Europe, all
of East Asia, and Australia. Some U.S. estimates, however, give
this missile only a 2,500-mile range, and it is not expected to
be operational before the year 2000. In a June 1994 statement,
the head of U.S. Naval Intelligence estimated a North Korean missile
could carry a nuclear warhead by the year 2000, or possibly as
early as this year. <sup>10</sup>
<P>
North Korea tested a variant of the Scud in May 1993. Called the
<I>Nodong-1 </I>, it has an estimated 625-mile range and is capable
of threatening U.S. forces in Japan. North Korea was reported
to have had 12 to 18 <I>Nodong-1 </I> missiles in early 1994. <sup>11</sup>
 There are also reports that the North is developing a solid-fueled
930-mile transportable variant, the Nodong-2, with the help of
Russian technicians. <sup>12</sup> 
<P>
Pyongyang began producing the 185-mile-range Scud-B in the mid-1980s,
after gaining advanced missile design knowledge from China and
from copying a <I>Scud-B</I> obtained from Egypt, most likely
in 1981. <sup>13</sup>  Pyongyang began production of the improved 300-mile-range
Scud-C in 1991 and is now estimated to be producing that missile
at a rate of 100 a year. The Scud-C is a mobile missile capable
of carrying high explosive, biological, or chemical warheads.
It has a range enabling it to reach all of South Korea. The North
is believed to maintain a total of 24 to 36 Scud-Cs in its Army.

<P>
According to Robert D. Walpole, Deputy Director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, &quot;North Korea is the largest proliferator [in the
world] of ballistic missiles.&quot; <sup>14</sup>   Pyongyang uses missile sales
to earn hard cash for oil. By one estimate North Korea has sold
Iran and Syria a total of 320 Scud-Cs. <sup>15</sup>  It also has enhanced Iran's
missile production capability. In turn, Iran may be providing
North Korea with missile test facilities. <sup>16</sup>  Although North Korea
has discussed missile sales with Libya, Walpole believes that
Iran probably will be the first to purchase <I>Nodong</I> missiles.
<P>
<B>India and Pakistan. </B>India and Pakistan have fought each
other in 1947, 1966, and 1971. In recent years both countries
have almost come to blows over the disputed state of Kashmir in
Northern India. Their nuclear competition dates from the 1970s.
Although claiming not to be a nuclear state, India is believed
to have exploded a 12-kiloton nuclear device in 1974, and Shekhar
Gupta, Senior Editor of<I> India Today</I>, estimates India has
enough fissile material to build 60 bombs. <sup>17</sup>  The opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) is committed to building a nuclear arsenal
and may lead the government after national elections early in
1996. Meanwhile, Pakistan is believed to have enough plutonium
for seven crude nuclear weapons. <sup>18</sup>  Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD)
charged in April of this year that he believes Pakistan has five
nuclear weapons and India possesses between five and ten. <sup>19</sup>  The
inability of the Bush Administration in 1990 to certify that Pakistan
lacked a nuclear weapon triggered provisions of the 1986 Pressler
Amendment barring U.S. military sales to Pakistan.
<P>
Both states are developing missiles that could be nuclear armed.
India is deploying the indigenously developed 150-mile-range Prithvi
 to reserve Army units. <sup>20</sup>  This is a liquid-fueled, mobile missile.
India is estimated to have 40 to 50 <I>Prithvi </I> missiles,
with the intention of building up to 80. <sup>21</sup>  In 1992 India tested
a variant of the liquid-fueled and immobile <I>Agni </I> missile
that flew over 1,500 miles. It is now considering deploying this
missile, <sup>22</sup> which is capable of reaching most of Pakistan and many
targets in China. Additionally, India is developing an Advanced
Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV) for commercial purposes, and this
could become a 2,500-mile-range missile. In 1993 the United States
stopped Russia from selling ICBM engine technology to India but
did go ahead and sell complete rocket engines that could assist
India in building more powerful missile engines.
<P>
With China's assistance, Pakistan began the development of its
Haft missiles in the early 1980s. First tested in 1989, the <I>Haft-1</I>
has a range of only 50 miles. Also under development are the 185-mile
<I>Haft-2 </I>and 375-mile <I>Haft-3</I> missiles. In 1991 U.S.
officials revealed that Pakistan was purchasing the 185-mile Chinese
M-11. <super23></sup>  Pakistan received transporter-erector-launchers for the
M-11 in February 1991 from China. In July 1995, U.S. spy satellites
discovered over 30 M-11 delivery cases at an air force base in
Pakistan. <sup>24</sup> 
<P>
Future Indian long-range ballistic missiles may be capable of
reaching U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. However,
India's and Pakistan's potential nuclear missile arsenals are
mainly to deter each other, while India also seeks to deter China.
While it would not threaten the United States, a nuclear missile
exchange between India and Pakistan would create incalculable
destruction and loss of life, fuel religious and ethnic conflict,
and destabilize South Asia and the Persian Gulf for decades.
<P>
<b>DIPLOMACY ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT PROLIFERATION </b>
<P>
Washington has tried diplomacy and sanctions to prevent nuclear
and missile proliferation in Asia. While these attempts have been
worthwhile, they have not stopped proliferation. China signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1992 but continues
to export nuclear technology. Most recently China is reported
to have sold Iran a calutron for enriching uranium, a critical
missing link in Iran's nuclear weapons program. <sup>25</sup>  China twice has
promised but failed to abide by the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which forbids the sale of missiles with ranges
over 185 miles. <sup>26</sup>  However, evidence is accumulating that China
earlier this year shipped more than 30 M-11s to Pakistan. <sup>27</sup>
<P>
North Korea signed the NPT in 1985 but has failed to comply fully
with its terms. For example, it refused until 1992 to allow inspections
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as required by
the pact and threatened to withdraw from the pact in March 1993
in reaction to IAEA requests to inspect a nuclear waste dump.
This dump, which would have yielded information on the extent
of North Korean plutonium production, still has not been inspected.
In addition, North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge, made to
South Korea in 1991, to create a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula.
The threat of limited United Nations sanctions in 1994 forced
Pyongyang to agree to &quot;freeze&quot; its nuclear program.
In October 1994 North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle
its existing nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants that would be financed and built by an international
consortium. However, the pact allows Pyongyang to delay full IAEA
inspections for five years or more and stipulates that these inspections
will not begin until &quot;significant components&quot; of the
reactors are delivered.
<P>
Pyongyang has challenged and will likely continue to challenge
the implementation of this complex agreement.<sup>28</sup>  Pyongyang's objections
to Seoul's role in building the proposed light-water reactors
heightened tensions and again led to a flurry of U.S.-North Korean
negotiations this Spring and to further delay in the agreement's
implementation. Meanwhile, it is possible that North Korea continues
nuclear weapons-related research and development in locations
unknown to the IAEA  which cannot undertake full-scope inspections.
North Korea also refuses to join the MTCR. North Korea's ability
to undermine the NPT and IAEA and flout the MTCR all demonstrate
the weakness of diplomacy in stemming nuclear proliferation.
<P>
Both India and Pakistan also have refused to sign the NPT and
join the MTCR. The Pressler Amendment sanctions against Pakistan,
which have barred U.S. military sales since 1990, have yet to
convince Islamabad to end its nuclear weapons program. The Bush
Administration tried, but failed, to convince India and Pakistan
to negotiate a South Asian Nuclear Free Zone.<sup>29</sup>  In 1994 Pakistan
rejected a Clinton Administration proposal that the United States
and NATO guarantee Pakistan's security if it denuclearized.<sup>30</sup>
<P>
<b>THE DANGERS OF A WEAKER U.S. DETERRENT IN ASIA</b>
<P>
America's extended nuclear and conventional force deterrent is
the foundation of security in the Asia-Pacific region. This American
commitment obviates the need for allies and friends to build their
own nuclear deterrent. The possibility of nuclear proliferation
in Asia increases when America's commitment is undermined, either
from Washington or by new nuclear threats. After China's threatening
July missile tests, in Taiwan's parliament on July 28, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui responded to a question from opposition
Democratic Progressive Party member Liu Jui-hsiung on whether
Taiwan should develop nuclear weapons. &quot;Whether [we] need
nuclear weapons would require long-term study,&quot; Lee said.
&quot;Taiwan used to have the capability to build nuclear weapons
but it caused international concern and damaged the country's
image.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 
<P>
Indeed, it was the Carter Administration's decision to end diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and its attempt to reduce U.S. troops in
South Korea that increased interest in nuclear weapons in both
countries. Washington convinced Taipei not to proceed with attempts
to acquire plutonium in the late 1970s and to end nuclear weapons-related
research in the late 1980s.<sup>32</sup>  A retired South Korean general has
disclosed that in the late 1970s South Korea almost completed
an atomic bomb, but the project stopped after pressure from Washington.<sup>33</sup>

<P>
Although, although Japan's national policy since 1971 has been
not to manufacture, possess, or allow the introduction of nuclear
weapons into Japan, in 1994 then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata unnerved
many with the comment that &quot;It is certainly the case that
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but has not
made them.&quot;<sup>34</sup>  Only a series of cataclysmic events, such as
a rupture of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty combined with nuclear
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, would likely move Japan
to build nuclear weapons.<sup>35</sup> 
<P>
Missile technology is also widespread throughout Asia. Japan's
H-2 commercial space-launch vehicle conceivably could be turned
into a 9,300-mile-range ICBM. The South Korean Army deploys the
150-mile <I>NHK-1 </I>tactical missile. In June, Seoul reportedly
asked Washington to scrap a 1979 agreement that bars South Korea
from building missiles that travel more than 180 miles.<sup>36</sup>  Taipei
is developing the 80-mile-range<I> Green Bee</I> tactical missile
and the 600-mile-range <I>Sky Horse</I> missile.
<P>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES BENEFIT ASIANS AND AMERICANS</b>
<P>
Missile defense systems will increase the security of American
forces deployed abroad. At the same time, they can benefit the
United States and its Asian allies in other ways. For example:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Anti-missile systems offer a deterrent far less threatening
than nuclear weapons.</B>
<P>
Anti-missile systems are a less destabilizing way to deter attack
from nuclear missile-armed states.  Should a non-nuclear Asian
state build nuclear weapons, other non-nuclear states will be
inclined to follow suit. This is a recipe for further proliferation.
<P>
<LI><B>Anti-missile defenses reduce vulnerability to nuclear blackmail.</B>
<P>
China's July missile tests were intended to threaten Taiwan. With
appropriate anti-missile systems, Taiwan would not be as vulnerable
to future Chinese threats. Moreover, with adequate defenses, South
Korea and Japan could better withstand potential North Korean
or Chinese demands backed by nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses are insurance against accidental nuclear
missile launches.</B>
<P>
China is undergoing a near-term leadership transition in which
the military could emerge as a nationalist force. Because political
stability cannot be assured, concerns that the political leadership
may lose control of China's nuclear weapons cannot be dismissed.<sup>38</sup>
 Control of some of China's nuclear weapons may have been contested
in 1967, as reports indicate that the commander of the Chinese
military region containing the Lop Nor nuclear test facilities
rebelled briefly against Mao Tse-tung.<sup>39</sup>  In North Korea, presumed
leader Kim Jong-Il's intentions toward South Korea remain unclear,
while accurate knowledge of his health and mental stability is
lacking. Were he to be replaced by a faction bent on heightening
tensions with South Korea, the chances of an accidental missile
launch would grow.
<P>
<LI><B>Cooperation in missile defenses can build political confidence
in Asia.</B>
<P>
As missile defenses are non-threatening and reduce threats to
Asian population centers, multilateral efforts led by the United
States can enhance security, promote defense cooperation, and
advance U.S. leadership with Asian allies and friends. These measures
would decrease mistrust and increase confidence between Asian
countries.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses can create incentives to reduce both nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.</B>
<P>
For example, if both India and Pakistan possessed missile defenses,
there would be less incentive to launch missile attacks against
each other. A reduction in the utility of nuclear missiles could
enhance mutual confidence, opening the door to negotiations on
limiting and reducing nuclear and missile forces. Similarly, if
the ROC possessed adequate missile defenses, Taipei would have
a greater incentive to propose confidence-building measures with
Beijing. It could ask, for example, that Beijing join it in agreeing
not to deploy tactical or intermediate-range missiles within a
threatening proximity. If the U.S. and its Asian allies were to
create a regional missile defense system, they would have greater
credibility in approaching China, perhaps in the ASEAN Regional
Forum, about beginning a dialogue on shared missile defense systems.
This could serve as an incentive for Beijing to limit its short-range
and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
<P></OL>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES WILL STRENGTHEN ASIAN SECURITY</b>
<P>
American extended deterrence and forward deployment of conventional
forces serve as the foundation for Asian security. In order to
strengthen deterrence and security in Asia, the United States
must take the lead in dealing with Asia's emerging next threat:
 the proliferation of nuclear-armed missiles. The United States
is the only country with the technical and moral strength to counter
the growing missile threat in Asia.
<P>
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985 invited Australia,
Japan, and South Korea to participate in the Strategic Defense
Initiative.<sup>40</sup>  Only Japan responded positively, allowing private
companies in 1987 to participate in missile defense architecture
studies with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Clinton Administration
has built on this by seeking Japanese technological contributions
to missile defense systems more aggressively and by offering Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems on a commercial basis.
<P>
But the Administration's Asian missile defense architecture is
hobbled by its decision to abandon the Bush Administration's more
ambitious Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) program.
The Clinton Administration is limiting the U.S. missile defense
program to theater-based, short-range systems. The Administration
refuses to build space-based missile defense systems, like boost-phase
interceptors, that have a better chance of defending the United
States and its allies from missile attack. An active missile defense
strategy toward Asia can strengthen U.S. leadership by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating a major post-Cold War mission for the Asian-American
alliance system. </B>Building a regional missile defense architecture
is a service that only America can provide. A secure and stable
Asia will foster growth in job-creating U.S.-Asia trade. Equally
important, by cooperating with Washington to develop and fund
missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able
to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries
from nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Confirming the benign and defensive intent of American strategy
in Asia. </B>American leadership in missile defenses would offer
allied and friendly Asian states the same protection from limited
nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail that  Americans enjoy. Such
defenses threaten only the offensive weapons of potential aggressor
states in Asia.
<P>
<LI><B>Reversing the growing impression in Asia of American retreat
and weak leadership. </B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's policy flip-flops toward China, attempts
to manage trade with Japan, and inaction in response to aggressive
acts by China in the South China Sea and against Taiwan have reduced
American credibility in Asia. By exercising strong leadership
in missile defenses, Washington can regain lost political momentum
and begin to reverse diplomatic damage. A strategy to accomplish
this goal would entail:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Building and deploying a missile defense system for the United
States.</b>
<P>
A National Missile Defense (NMD) system is needed not only to
defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends
that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail.
Such a goal is both feasible and affordable. Earlier this year,
a team of experts assembled by The Heritage Foundation recommended
a National Missile Defense system based initially on the Navy's
Upper Tier proposal. This is an advanced high-velocity version
of the Navy's <I>Standard</I> surface-to-air missile system deployed
in AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Its guidance would be assisted
by the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> early warning and tracking satellite.
The Heritage plan then calls for Upper Tier to be supplemented
by space-based defenses, to include space-based missile interceptors
and lasers. The cost of the Upper Tier, <i>Brilliant Eyes,</i> and space
based systems is estimated to be about $25 billion over 15 years.<sup>41</sup>
 At the same time, it is critical that the U.S. retain adequate
offensive nuclear systems, although NMD would allow the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear deterrent forces.<sup>42</sup>
<P>
Space-based missile defense systems also would enable the U.S.
to complement any future TMD capabilities of its Asian allies.
If U.S. space-based interceptors or lasers did not destroy hostile
missiles early in their flight, U.S. satellites could help direct
Asian-based interceptors to their targets. Some countries in Asia,
like Australia, oppose a U.S. National Missile Defense program
because it might lead to abrogating the 1973 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. Washington should tell its friends that it seeks
ultimately to renegotiate the ABM Treaty with Russia to allow
for a limited national defense against missiles but that, in the
meantime, the ABM Treaty does not prohibit the United States from
deploying theater missile defenses in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Accelerating development and deployment of the Navy's Upper
Tier TMD system to the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD TMD
system to U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.</b>
<P>
The Clinton Administration should increase funding for the Navy's
Upper Tier TMD system, THAAD, and the Brilliant Eyes early warning
satellite. These TMD systems are needed urgently to defend U.S.
naval and ground forces in Asia.<sup>43</sup>  The Navy's Upper Tier system
is especially important because its mobility will enable the U.S.
Pacific Command to deploy a TMD system near South Korea or Taiwan.
This system also will protect U.S. naval forces within range of
Chinese medium-range missiles. The THAAD system is needed to defend
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan against North Korean Scud
 and <I>Nodong </I> missiles. Accelerated development of Upper
Tier and THAAD would make these systems more rapidly available
for sale to U.S. allies.
<P>
<LI><b>Encouraging Japan, South Korea, and Australia to acquire advanced
U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense cooperation.</b>
<P>
Washington should urge its major allies in Asia to purchase TMD
systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore
multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. Japan
is slowly developing a political consensus to purchase an advanced
U.S.-based TMD system. According to a recent study of potential
missile defense architectures for Japan, completed by private
U.S. and Japanese companies, a Japanese TMD system could include
advanced Patriot, THAAD, and naval-based Upper Tier systems guided
by missile targeting systems built into AWACS radar aircraft.
Washington should urge Tokyo to decide quickly on missile defense
architecture and to purchase those systems from the United States.
<P>
South Korea has a clear requirement to defend itself against North
Korean missiles. Therefore, it is interested in obtaining TMD
systems. Washington should urge Seoul to place a much higher priority
on purchasing TMD systems from the U.S. South Korea now relies
on the approximately 192 Patriot  missiles deployed in the Spring
of 1994, which mainly protect U.S. forces in South Korea and are
not enough to defend ROK forces or cities.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
Australia, which refused to join the 1985 U.S. offer of SDI international
cooperation, finally signed a missile defense research agreement
with the U.S. in June 1995.<sup>45</sup>  During the Gulf War, a jointly manned
early warning satellite downlink in Nurrungar, Australia, helped
target attacking Iraqi Scud  missiles. The U.S. should encourage
Australia to consider purchasing naval-based Upper Tier systems
and placing them in air defense frigates which Australia plans
to build. Washington should ask Canberra to consider hosting a
multinational missile defense early warning observation facility
at Nurrungar. The facility would be open to Western allies cooperating
in missile defense and to other states seeking neutral enforcement
mechanisms for missile control or reduction agreements.
<P>
Washington also should encourage missile defense cooperation between
South Korea and Japan. The major reason for this is to help South
Korea avoid any unintended damage from Chinese or North Korean
missiles destroyed on their way to Japan. When the Upper Tier
AEGIS cruisers are introduced to the 7th Fleet, the U.S. Navy
should demonstrate their capability to allies and friends in Southeast
Asia and make their use a regular part of multilateral exercises,
like <I>KANGAROO</I> in Australia and <I>RIMPAC,</I> conducted
bi-annually with most U.S. allies and friends in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Telling China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.</b>
<P>
Washington should continue to urge Beijing to abide fully by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime. Washington also should urge Beijing to make its
nuclear weapons programs more transparent and to consider eventual
limitations on its nuclear arsenal. But added pressure on China
is needed. The Chinese should be told that if they do not curb
nuclear technology cooperation with countries like Pakistan and
Iran, and missile sales to Pakistan, China will begin to define
itself as an adversary.
<P>
The Clinton Administration should obey the 1990 Arms Export Control
Act that obligates the United States to impose trade sanctions
on China because of its sale of missiles to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence
agencies believe China has shipped over 30 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
This charge cannot be swept under the rug. Failure to respond
to China's sale of missiles makes a mockery of the Administration's
nonproliferation policies. The Clinton Administration should devise
a graduated schedule of sanctions that will be ended when China
joins the MTCR.
<P>
Clinton should also explain to the Chinese that missile defenses
are a justified and moral response to China's continued nuclear
weapons buildup and its demonstrated willingness to engage in
nuclear threats. Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees
to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsenal, the
U.S. will make available to China early warning data.
<P>
<LI><b>Selling advanced TMD systems to Taiwan, consistent with the
Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval TMD forces to help
defend Taiwan.</b>
<P>
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) calls for the U.S. to &quot;provide
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and to &quot;maintain
the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
or the social economic system of the people of Taiwan.&quot; 
Following China's missile &quot;tests&quot; designed to threaten
Taiwan, sale of missile defense systems to Taiwan is consistent
with the TRA. Raytheon Company is helping Taiwan build a variant
of the Patriot PAC-2 called the Modified Air Defense System.<sup>46</sup> 
Since this program does not respond to Taiwan's immediate defense
needs, Washington should offer Taipei the more capable <I>Patriot</I>
 PAC-2 GEM  the most advanced variant in the U.S. Army  and consider
offering THAAD if Beijing persists in threatening Taipei. Washington
should make clear to Beijing that the sale of missile defense
systems to Taiwan does not threaten China. Rather, the purpose
is to prevent China's nuclear blackmail of Taiwan. Washington
also should prepare to use 7th Fleet AEGIS cruisers and destroyers
armed with the Standard Upper Tier TMD missiles to defend Taiwan,
consistent with the TRA.
<P>
<LI><b>Offering India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.</b>
<P>
To advance non-proliferation initiatives between India and Pakistan,
the United States should offer both countries missile defenses
and technology if they agree to limit and reduce their nuclear
and missile arsenals. A verifiable treaty to limit such systems
might be facilitated by giving Indian and Pakistani officials
access to a U.S. monitor that receives data from U.S. early warning
and reconnaissance satellites or a similar monitor placed in another
location. A monitor would enable both countries to observe each
other's military sites and provide warning of a first strike.
The agreement could be strengthened later by the sale of ground-based
TMD systems to both countries. After acquiring space-based missile
defense systems, the U.S. might help enforce an Indian-Pakistan
nuclear and missile reduction treaty by extending space-based
missile defense coverage to both countries. Space-based defenses
also could give Washington the option to intervene unilaterally
to prevent a disastrous nuclear exchange.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
The United States must develop a missile defense strategy for
Asia. Missile defenses are needed to enhance the security of U.S.
military forces in Asia, to safeguard America's Asian friends
and allies, and to encourage multilateral missile defense cooperation.
This strategy is sorely needed to enable Americans and Asians
to reduce their vulnerability to Chinese and future North Korean
nuclear missiles. Both countries have demonstrated they are prepared
to disregard conventions like the NPT and MTCR. China's willingness
to use missiles to intimidate neighbors like Taiwan, in addition
to concerns about instability in China or North Korea, compels
Americans and Asians to plan jointly for appropriate missile defenses.
<P>
Only the United States has the technical capability and the moral
vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail
or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation. By responding
to the threat of nuclear missiles in Asia, the U.S. can counter
perhaps the most critical emerging threat to peace in that region.
At the same time, by demonstrating determination to counter this
threat, Washington will be strengthening its extended nuclear
and conventional deterrent in Asia while lessening the possibility
that Asia could become destabilized by nuclear proliferation.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As the Senate considers the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill, it must consider funding for AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House already has voted to end funding for this program. While it is hailed by the Administration and its supporters as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, it actually has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project. In an era of budget deficits, the Administration is asking the American taxpayer to support a program that funds bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts in order to fund the President's pet program. 
<p>
Although supporters maintain that AmeriCorps is a successful "program that encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to college and disperses decision-making power from Washington to the states,"1 the rhetoric contrasts sharply with reality. The Senate should follow the bold lead of the House of Representatives and terminate AmeriCorps because it:
<p><ul>
<li>Does little to help American families pay for college;

<li>Destroys the spirit of volunteerism;

<li>Removes participants from local communities where they are needed and uses them to enlarge the federal bureaucracy; 

<li>Improperly funds partisan political activities; and

<li>Costs the taxpayers too much.
</ul>
<p>
FAILING TO HELP AMERICAN FAMILIES PAY FOR COLLEGE
<p>
AmeriCorps does little to help working families pay for college and fails to accomplish its stated goal of "expanding educational opportunity."2  The program's eligibility criteria allow any individual, regardless of income, to qualify for its benefits. For example, President Clinton's daughter Chelsea could receive the same educational award voucher as more needy participants and could be selected over youth from families who need help to meet the rising cost of post-secondary education. The only requirements are the following:3
<p><ul>
<li>Participants must be citizens or legal resident aliens aged seventeen or older at the commencement of service in many cases.

<li>Participants may serve before, during, or after post-secondary education.

<li>Participants must have a high school degree to receive education vouchers.4</ul><p>Thus, the children of wealthy and influential people can elbow out poor students. As Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) has noted, for every one AmeriCorps participant (who may or may not need financial assistance) who receives college benefits, many more needy students could qualify for Pell Grants.5<p>	Chart 1 indicates that if the federal government took one AmeriCorps award of $26,700, and converted it into a means-tested program, it could provide approximately 18 students with college Pell Grants for each AmeriCorps participant. If the President's goal is to help those who need funding for higher education, means-tested programs would provide more opportunity to more people.<p>UNDERMINING THE SPIRIT OF VOLUNTEERISM
<p>
The generosity of AmeriCorps' benefits also sends a mixed message about volunteering. Taxpayers do not need another program to do what millions of Americans already are doing. Private sector community service is thriving. There are numerous state and local volunteer programs that idealistic young people may join. Surveys by Independent Sector show that in 1994, 89.2 million Americans 18 and over volunteered in some capacity, for an average of 4.2 hours a week. They were not moved by the lure of a lucrative government job, but by a spirit of true volunteerism and genuine service.
<p>
	In particular, volunteer activity is flourishing among college students across the country. Campus-based volunteer student groups are expanding, and more schools are encouraging students to volunteer by broadening their regular curricula to include service jobs.6 The federal Commission on National and Community Service is calling on schools and colleges to encourage more students to perform volunteer work,7 but almost every college and university in the United States already gives students opportunities to earn school credit for participating in community service activities. For example, Rutgers University, the site chosen by President Clinton to announce the AmeriCorps program, integrates community service into the undergraduate curriculum, through its Civic Education and Community Service Program. The course work includes a combination of traditional academic disciplines related to volunteer services performed in the communities that are home to Rutgers campuses.8<p>	Similarly, Loyola University in Chicago features programs designed to inspire students to help alleviate Chicago's urban blight. It sponsors partnerships with area schools and a community policing project for criminal justice and sociology students. Other academic programs attract students to service-oriented careers, such as social work and nursing.9<p>	Even Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., the private school attended by Chelsea Clinton, requires community service. There are student work programs and voluntary service projects on and off campus for all grades, mandatory service projects for ninth-graders, and 30 hours of off-campus community service required for graduation, according to a Sidwell brochure.
<p>
	By providing payment for "volunteering," however, AmeriCorps weakens the spirit of volunteerism and undermines efforts to promote true community service. Moreover, AmeriCorps creates a huge bureaucracy to do what 51.1 percent of Americans over the age of 18 already do.10 As Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) has noted, " [With] federal bureaucrats involved, you need a federal bureaucracy to write the grant announcement, a federal bureaucrat to oversee and review the grant applications, another federal bureaucrat to issue the grant, then you need a state bureaucrat to write the grant, a state bureaucrat to establish a `dialogue' with the local communities, and you will need several staff at the local level to make sure that they are complying with all the guidelines and red tape required by the federal government."11  AmeriCorps embodies all of the principles of enlarging rather than reinventing government.<p>	AmeriCorps further corrupts and undermines true volunteerism by encouraging successful, independent, local volunteer organizations to become dependent upon federal funding. AmeriCorps makes participating programs look to the federal bureaucracy for money and solutions to the problems in their backyards rather than take the initiative to solve community problems themselves.
<p>

ENLARGING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
<p>
In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000 "volunteers" described as "working all over America, helping people -- person to person."12  In reality, a significant number of these highly paid "volunteers" are working in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded programs, or political action organizations. Of the 20,000 "volunteers" currently participating in the program, 2,053 are working inside the federal bureaucracies on programs funded by the federal government. Chart 2 presents a breakdown of AmeriCorps participation within the federal government.
<p>

ENGAGING IN PARTISAN POLITICS
<p>
Several AmeriCorps programs have ignored the Corporation's mission statement of addressing the nation's problems through direct community service. Instead, they have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers. 
<p>
	 Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 clearly states that:  "any approved national service position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political organization.... "
<P>
	But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps "Summer of Safety" program last year organized 40 groups to rally against the federal crime bill's "three strikes and you're out" provision.13 Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission statement was a non-profit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed to use its "volunteers" to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods. Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. "The 'volunteers' had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door in April and May (1995) when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb were fighting for re-election."14  According to 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor, "We realized there was something politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying... this was a great position we were in, making public officials accountable for their jobs."15  The Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding, but the example shows the potential for abuse.<p>HEAVY COST TO TAXPAYERS<p>During the debate on AmeriCorps in the 103rd Congress, several Senators made floor statements offering to eliminate the program if it proved too costly and was found to be unsuccessful. One was Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), who declared that "Congress will not, and should not, fund a program if it is unsuccessful. I do not believe it will happen but if it does I would favor cutting the program."16<p>	The General Accounting Office (GAO) has just released a report requested by Senator Grassley on the costs of the AmeriCorps program.17 Senator Grassley asked for the investigation of the costs after the 103rd Congress approved a 96 percent increase in funding that raised program spending from $217.3 million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $427.3 million in Fiscal Year 1995 (including the National Service Trust and AmeriCorps grant).18 The Administra
tion is asking the American taxpayers to pay for an expensive program that cannot provide evidence of its benefits to the taxpayer or to the local communities it is suppose to serve. Further, the Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees AmeriCorps, is not required to evaluate the program rigorously over the long term.19<p>	The GAO report highlights important discrepancies between the Clinton Administration's estimates of how much AmeriCorps costs and the true costs. According to the GAO, the cost is approximately $26,700 per volunteer for ten months work. This estimate, as noted by the GAO, is substantially higher than the Clinton Administration's. Eli Segal, chief executive officer of AmeriCorps, stated in congressional testimony this March that the total cost, which includes all benefits and education vouchers, per "volunteer" would be no more than $18,800.20 The GAO's research, however, reveals that costs are more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. The Administration now claims that the $17,600 figure was intended to represent only the federal contribution.<p>	Chart 3 summarizes GAO estimates of the cost per "volunteer."	As the GAO report clearly points out, the federal government is the primary source of funds for the program. Only 7 percent of the AmeriCorps budget comes from private sources, with the federal government responsible for 79 percent of the costs and state and local tax dollars covering 14 percent. This is the opposite of the Administration's intention when the program was created. In a February 28, 1993, <i>New York Times</i> op-ed, President Clinton stated that the program would receive its funding primarily from the private sector:
<p>
<blockquote>	While the Federal Government will provide the seed money for national service, we are determined that the participants -- the individuals who serve and the groups that sponsor their service -- will guide the process. Spending tens of millions of tax dollars to build a massive bureaucracy would be self defeating.21</blockquote><p>	The program has failed to demonstrate an ability to leverage other private sector money and is spending far more of the taxpayers' money.<p>	According to the Corporation for National Service, the total direct compensation package for an AmeriCorps "volunteer" is worth nearly $13,000 for approximately 10 months of work -- nearly $15,900 on an annual basis. This is more than the amount that 42.3 percent of young householders, ages 15-24, take home as pay on an annual basis.22 Moreover, AmeriCorps "volunteers" have a greater opportunity to obtain additional benefits and grants than many workers in the private sector, including those with secondary degrees and years of work experience. For instance, each "volunteer" is paid a $7,400 cash stipend along with a $4,725 tuition credit. In addition, the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, the legislation which created AmeriCorps, allows states and service organizations to supplement the federal compensation package. These "volunteers" can be paid up to twice the minimum wage, or $8.50 per hour, and still be eligible for the $4,725 education credit and free medical and child care benefits.
<p>
	Although the average AmeriCorps "volunteer" receives approximately $13,000 in benefits, the GAO found that the total average cost per "volunteer" is nearly $27,000. Therefore, more than half of the cost is going to bureaucracy and overhead -- not even to the young people participating. For instance, the Navy's Seaborne Conservation Corps costs $66,715 per "volunteer" and $49.06 per hour of direct service; the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps costs $42,758 per participant and $31.44 per hour of direct service; and Magic Me of Baltimore, Maryland, costs $49,652 per participant and $36.51 per hour of direct service.23<p>	Surprisingly, in a recent editorial, <i>Washington Post</i> journalist E.J. Dionne, Jr., suggested that AmeriCorps should continue because "government agencies can accomplish useful things at a low price."24  But AmeriCorps is not low cost, and it is still a mere assertion of opinion that agencies are accomplishing useful things. Regardless of where the resources come from, "volunteers" are compensated better than many young adults in the private sector.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared that "National service will be America at its best -- building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility. National service is a challenge for Americans from every background and way of life, and it values something far more than money."25  The President's rhetoric is appealing. However, despite a $1.7 million public relations budget, the laudable goals of AmeriCorps do not match its reality. AmeriCorps sounds good on paper, but it is nothing more than an expensive and largely bureaucratic government jobs program. It does little to promote the true spirit of volunteerism and lacks any means-testing assurances that its financial rewards actually will go to those most in need of college assistance. 
<p>
	 Congress should repeal the AmeriCorps program.

<title>Clinton's Bosnia Venture Threatens What It Is Supposed to Uphold -- Heritage</title>

<h3>CLINTON'S BOSNIA VENTURE THREATENS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD -- THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</h3> 
By Thomas Moore<br>
Deputy Director, Foreign Policy and Defense Studies
<p>
John Hillen<br>
Policy Analyst<br><p>

<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 267<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating Backgrounder No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
A year ago, The Heritage Foundation warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's credibility was being severely damaged by subordination of its Bosnian peace enforcement efforts to an impotent and ineffective United Nations (UNPROFOR) command structure. At the same time, Heritage warned that misguided attempts to salvage NATO's credibility by "Americanizing" the Balkan conflict could destroy the alliance, because it would impose a responsibility which NATO was not designed to handle.<sup>1</sup> <p>
Today, as a result of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton peace agreement</a>, the Bosnia war is being Americanized. Advance parties of U.S. and allied troops already are in Bosnia or on their way. Now that the formal peace agreement has been signed in Paris, the U.S. First Armored Division will begin moving from Germany into northeast Bosnia. In all, some 60,000 NATO troops, including upwards of 20,000 Americans and contingents from 11 non-NATO countries, will take part in the Bosnian Implementation Force (IFOR). This number does not include the even larger logistical "tail," as well as naval and air units, that will be dedicated to supporting U.S. elements on the ground. 
<p>
This massive deployment of American ground forces for a peacekeeping mission -- one in which there is no emergency, no threat to U.S. lives, and no immediate national security interest at stake -- is unprecedented. Nevertheless, it is going forward. On Decemer 13 the Senate offered qualified and grudging support for the troops and mission in Bosnia, while the House backed the troops but opposed the President's policy.
<P>
Deploying 20,000 U.S. troops to IFOR is highly risky and unnecessary. But the Clinton Administration painted the United States into a corner with ill-considered promises of ground troops and by making U.S. participation in the peacekeeping force a condition of the Dayton peace framework. Once these commitments were on the table, the Administration found it necessary to invoke the sanctity of U.S. commitments, America's credibility and prestige, and the continued strength of the Atlantic alliance in order to sell the deployment to Congress. For these reasons, Congress had no choice but to offer its support at least for U.S. troops in Bosnia.
<p>
The IFOR commitment, entered into hastily and without thoughtful analysis, is, in the words of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an example of a vital national interest which has been "self-created."<sup>2</sup>  But this is the hand that has been dealt, and the U.S. must play it out as best it can. Though there are risks in going into Bosnia, the Clinton Administration's intellectual confusion and incompetent statecraft have set up a situation in which there also are penalties if America turns its back on NATO and the allies at this stage. The U.S. has to weigh the actual and certain damage of reneging on its promises against the potential and uncertain damage if the mission should fail at some future point. Presented with a wholly unnecessary <i>fait accompli</i>, the Congress now must support American troops while expressing strong reservations about the Bosnia mission, laying down markers for its success or failure, and establishing some clear guidelines for implementation of the peace plan.
<p>
The President once again has led the nation into a foreign policy <i>cul de sac</i> with no good choices. American and allied soldiers in IFOR may lose their lives, all in the name of "preserving NATO."  Since public opposition to the U.S. role in IFOR is both broad and deep, the Administration's Bosnian sales pitch may well result in loss of public support for the NATO alliance as IFOR casualties mount. 
<p>
As the U.S. wades deeper into this proverbial quagmire, it is time to look at past mistakes and future risks. The nation's leaders must make sure this mission does not turn into another Somalia episode, destroying the very things it is supposed to uphold -- U.S. leadership, credibility, prestige, the sanctity of U.S. commitments, and especially the health of the Western alliance.
<p>

<b>Correcting the Administration's Mistakes</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has made some serious mistakes in its policy on Bosnia. The President and Congress should correct these mistakes in the coming days and weeks.
<p>
<b>Mistake #1:  Linking the Implementation Force to NATO</b><br>
The President must stop making IFOR a test case for NATO, and the Administration must begin to anticipate what will happen to public support for NATO as a result of this policy linkage if the Bosnia mission results in the loss of U.S. soldiers and a premature withdrawal. Such an outcome would be far more destructive of NATO than a U.S. refusal to commit ground troops to IFOR at the outset. NATO is more important to the U.S. than IFOR, and American public support for NATO must transcend the ups and downs of this peace implementation mission.
<p>
<b>Mistake #2:  De Facto Changes in the North Atlantic Treaty</b><br>
Having experienced the failure of the UNPROFOR command arrangement, the Administration refused to deploy U.S. troops to Bosnia under the United Nations. This was a wise move. Only a tried and true military command structure, one in which the U.S. is the dominant military partner, is acceptable for U.S. troops in potential danger. Putting IFOR under NATO was the only practical choice.
<p>
However, in sending troops on a peace enforcement mission to Bosnia under NATO, the Administration has turned the North Atlantic Treaty into something other than a mutual defense treaty. Article 5 of the treaty explicitly makes NATO a defensive alliance:  An attack upon one is an attack upon all. It does not authorize out-of-area peacekeeping operations. 
<p>
The Administration must begin to address the impact of unilaterally stretching the fabric of the Atlantic alliance beyond what it will bear. If the North Atlantic Treaty is going to be converted into something other than a mutual defense treaty that leads to more Bosnia-like missions in the future, then the American people (as well as the other 15 member nations of NATO) have the right to approve. In America's case, approval should come through the advise-and-consent treaty prerogative of the U.S. Senate under the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Mistake #3: Confusion Over Ends and Means</b><br>
	NATO has never been an end in itself, but a means to achieve the collective defense of its members. As such, it is still immensely important and worth preserving. However, since the threat and the historical conditions which gave birth to NATO have changed dramatically, NATO cannot expect to remain the same and still be relevant to the security needs of Europe and the strategic interests of the United States. Those needs still exist, even if in different form, and must be articulated clearly by the President and his national security leadership. By invoking NATO to justify an unpopular IFOR mission, the Administration has confused this equation and made NATO the end in itself. That argument will not be sustainable if things in Bosnia go wrong. If the IFOR mission fails, it will be seen as a failure of NATO. Questions then will be raised about the efficacy and necessity of NATO. As a result, perhaps America's most important military alliance will have been put in jeopardy.
<p>
<b>Mistake #4: Neglecting the Selection of NATO's Secretary General</b><br>
The Administration either acquiesced in, or actively participated in, the short-sighted decision to pick Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana as NATO's new Secretary General. Solana, a leading Spanish Socialist, opposed Spain's entry into NATO and was active in trying to expel the U.S. from NATO air bases in Spain. While he may have experienced a "confirmation conversion," American supporters of NATO are entitled to be skeptical of the selection of a man with marginal qualifications and whose country is not part of NATO's integrated command structure, especially at what is perhaps the most critical moment in NATO's recent history. 
<p>
The Administration is willing to send 20,000 U.S. soldiers into potential combat "in order to preserve NATO," but it was not willing to insist on -- or even recruit, if necessary -- a highly qualified and credible Secretary General from a country which is part of the integrated military command. It is too late now to make another choice, but it is not too late for the United States to demand that the new Secretary General:
<p><ul>
<li> Respect the essential military nature of NATO as a defensive alliance. Efforts to get NATO involved in "nation building" and other civilian activities should be resisted, while attempts formally to change NATO's charter to deal with peacekeeping and other quasi-military missions should be discouraged;
<p>
<li> Assert NATO's primacy in the implementation of the Bosnia peace accord to insure that refugee matters and nation-building activity by the U.N. and the Organization for Security and Cooperations in Europe do not interfere with military operations under NATO;
<p>
<li> Defer to NATO's Supreme Military Commander in all matters related to IFOR military operations; and
<p>
<li> Support robust rules of engagement and aggressive force protection measures.
</ul><p>
<b>Mistake #5: Turning the U.S. Armed Services into a Constabulary Force</b><br>
The principal mission of the U.S. armed forces is to fight and win America's wars. This mission requires continuous, arduous, and dedicated training. In contrast, the Clinton Administration has demonstrated a peculiar propensity toward using U.S. military forces for peacekeeping, peace enforcement, humanitarian, and other non-traditional missions while neglecting to provide the resources and commitment needed to keep them in the best fighting trim. In effect, the Administration, led by a commander in chief notoriously inexperienced in foreign and defense policy, is in danger of turning America's combat-ready forces into a constabulary force and NATO into a regional policing organization. If NATO is to remain viable, its primary mission must remain self-defense and deterrence, not peacekeeping and peace enforcement.
<p>
One of the greatest concerns of U.S. Army commanders being deployed to Bosnia is the inevitable erosion of their units' combat skills, which demand constant and rigorous training to keep honed. The U.S. deployment to Bosnia requires the great majority of the ground combat strength of U.S. forces in Europe. Upon returning to their bases in Germany from Bosnia, these troops will need many months to retrain and regain the warfighting skills that will atrophy during the IFOR mission. This effectively puts the U.S. Army in Europe out of the warfighting business for at least two years. The problem was highlighted recently in a General Accounting Office report charting the deleterious and alarming effects of peace operations on combat readiness.<sup>3</sup>  After a year in Bosnia on peacekeeping duty, the U.S. First Armored Division, now arguably the best, most combat-ready heavy division in the world, will no longer be at a state of readiness to perform its warfighting mission should a crisis erupt in another part of the world.
 <p><b>"Inoculating" NATO Against Failure in Bosnia</b><p>
In addition to correcting these mistakes, there are several steps the Administration and Congress should take to inoculate NATO against the possible failure of IFOR. The ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the peace accord and the military plan have exposed the contrary and clashing ambitions of the allies. The Administration must end the rhetorical oversell, begin a serious assessment of these inherent deficiencies, and develop strategies to deal with them as they become evident on the ground. Above all, the U.S. should take the lead in assuring that the cracks now appearing in NATO's approach to IFOR will not widen as this poorly planned mission proceeds. The first priority is to ensure a political and military unity of effort among the NATO allies.
<P>
<b>Getting Political Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 America and Europe have fundamentally different policy approaches to the Bosnian problem that transcend the provisions of the peace accord initialed in Dayton. The first and most obvious disagreement is over goals, end-states, and commitment. America's European allies, having been on the ground in the former Yugoslavia for the better part of the four-year war, understand that a long-term commitment is needed to address this enigmatic and intractable conflict. In the face of extended European commitment to the long-term rehabilitation of war-torn Bosnian society, the Clinton Administration has proposed a plan that has U.S. troops redeploying within nine or ten months. It is obvious to the European allies that, for the U.S., the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the goals are fully achieved."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
According to the timetable laid out in the Dayton peace accords, the period when U.S. troops will be ready to redeploy will be the most crucial and fragile period in the peace implementation plan. It is at this time that the critical issues of disarmament, refugee resettlement, elections, and the political formation of an elaborate central Bosnian government all will be coming to the fore. It is also at this time that the U.S. commitment will be waning.
<p>
The second policy disagreement concerns arming and training the Bosnian Muslims, a policy the European NATO partners have resisted vigorously throughout the conflict. If the expected scenario is played out, nine or ten months into this operation, American troops will be redeploying and European forces will be manning the buffer zone and assisting in nation-building while the U.S. is sponsoring the arming and training of the Bosnian army. The International Institute of Strategic Studies in London recently noted that this "will not only undermine the impartiality which IFOR is now insisting on, but it will certainly encourage, if that was ever needed, Croat and Serb forces to maintain their own arsenals."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Clearly, such fundamental policy disagreements need to be addressed thoroughly before more soldiers set foot on the ground. Otherwise, much as disagreement over disarmament did in Somalia, the issue will work to split the alliance and bring down the mission. America and her allies have a peace accord and a peace implementation plan. They do not have full agreement on a final political settlement, intermediate and long-term objectives, criteria for success, and a road map to get there.
<p>
<b>Getting Military Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 NATO is one of the few military alliances with a consistent, reliable, and rehearsed common doctrine as well as standard operating procedures. However, this common doctrine is no assurance of a common approach to the military aspects of the peace implementation mission. It is a challenge in any multinational mission to ensure that a common tactical and operational approach is used by all forces. This challenge increases by leaps and bounds in a mission that has ill-defined goals, objectives, and end-states. As noted above, the Bosnia implementation plan is not well-defined enough to ensure a unified and common approach to operations.
<p>
In the U.N. operation in Somalia, the forces involved operated under standard rules of engagement and a common operational plan, and yet there were great differences in interpreting military actions in this peace-enforcement mission. In Somalia, the U.S. had its most significant differences with another NATO ally -- Italy -- and even demanded the United Nations fire the Italian military commander after he publicly criticized the American contingent's aggressive approach to operations. Common doctrine in a contentious mission by no means guarantees unity of effort. A disagreement over tactics and operations easily can lead to a splintering of the mission.
<p>
In Bosnia, the U.S., French, British, Russian, and 19 other military contingents (both NATO and non-NATO) also will interpret the mission and rules of engagement differently. America's European allies tend to operate with much greater restraint and patience as a result of their long experience with these types of missions. They eschew both the emphasis on disproportionate and overwhelming force by the U.S.<sup>6</sup>  and the wanton use of force by the Russians in conflicts such as Chechnya. In fact, a recent British military report emphasized that "American doctrine currently lacks the subtlety required for internal conflict and is in danger of being associated with an inexact and counter-productive use of force."<sup>7</sup>  The European allies are not nearly as impatient or intolerant of casualties as the U.S. and are willing to bear far greater restraints for longer periods of time in these types of missions.<p><b>NATO Expansion.</b><br> One of the most profound ways the Administration can inoculate NATO against failure in Bosnia is to embark upon a coherent and thoughtful program of NATO expansion. This will give the alliance new life and energy, and will reassert its role as a mutual security treaty by integrating the new democratic states of East and Central Europe.
<p>
NATO has been the foundation of European security for 45 years, possibly the most successful such alliance in history. The U.S. should support a renewed and enlarged NATO because it guarantees an American presence on the European continent and a "seat at the table" in the world's most vital, productive region. The United States has clear, abiding, and vital interests in Europe. Europe is the soil where America's deepest roots are found. America is bound to Europe by innumerable links of trade, finance, communications, and technology exchange; ties of history, culture, and shared values; and nearly five decades of mutual security arrangements. 
<p>
A free and stable Europe has always been essential to the United States. In the 20th century, the U.S. has intervened in two bloody world wars to prevent the domination of Europe by aggressive dictatorships. Moreover, America paid a high price for 45 years of Cold War to prevent the domination of Europe and the Eurasian landmass by communist imperialism. This involvement and stabilizing presence have made the U.S. in effect a European power. Americans cannot cut themselves off from Europe without doing harm to the U.S. as a world power, and as a people.
<p>
Europe cannot remain stable and prosperous, to the mutual benefit of the U.S. and the European allies, if its post-Cold War boundary is drawn along the borders of Germany and Austria. Such an artificial division would leave a power vacuum in East Central Europe and consign millions of people who share America's democratic values and aspirations to an uncertain fate. A new European security framework will not hold up unless it reflects the realities of the political upheaval that marked the end of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. That new reality includes the re-orienting of former East Bloc states toward the West.
<p>
There are other reasons to enlarge NATO-- for example, to lessen internal tensions between members and facilitate the resolution of conflicts-- but the U.S. must not lose sight of the fact that NATO has been successful because it was a defensive alliance. Turning it into something else could weaken it fatally. At the very least, changing the nature of NATO, as the Administration is doing in Bosnia, requires debate in Congress. Unless America understands that NATO's underlying and abiding purpose remains to defend Europe, the burdens of the alliance over time will cause NATO to crumble.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
Because the Bosnian peace implementation plan is weak and ambiguous in many of its military provisions, there is a great possibility that several major policy imbroglios could develop between the U.S. and its NATO allies. As British strategist William Shawcross recently noted in <i>The Times</i> of London, "A real danger is that, although the Dayton agreement provides a chance to end the war, its complexities, its contradictions and the different if not conflicting ambitions of the Allies mean that it, too, may be seen to fail. That would be an even more serious failure than that of the UN. It would be the defeat of NATO, and of the Western Alliance."<sup>8</sup> <p><b>What Congress Should Do </b><p>Deep opposition to the IFOR deployment exists in both political parties and in both houses of Congress. But at this stage, the 104th Congress has been unwilling to challenge the President's constitutional prerogatives as commander in chief, either by a statutory prohibition of U.S. participation in IFOR or by cutting off funds, both of which are within Congress's power. Once American forces are deployed on missions where hostile action is possible, Congress usually is reluctant to endanger them or undermine their success by making the mission the object of a domestic political struggle. The Administration, counting on this traditional support for the troops, was confident its Bosnia <i>fait accompli</i> would survive congressional action.
<p>
On December 13, the Senate voted 69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain resolution, which supports the men and women in uniform but "does not endorse the President's decision ...[or] the agreement reached in Dayton," according to Majority Leader Dole. The House, which had voted to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission, was even more forceful, voting 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops being deployed. This tepid endorsement provides political distance for Members of Congress should the President's Bosnian intervention result in catastrophic failure. 
<p>
But expressing support for the troops while criticizing the Dayton plan and IFOR's mission does not end Congress's responsibility. Congress simply cannot wash its hands of the issue and cede all responsibility to a President who has shown such ineptness in foreign and defense policy. If Members believe the IFOR mission is dangerously flawed, they have a responsibility to continue their efforts to mitigate the dangers. This would demonstrate actual and not just rhetorical support for the troops facing possible death or injury in Bosnia.
<p>
How should Congress respond to the Administration's <i>fait accompli</i>?  First, Congress should continue to exercise its oversight responsibility by reviewing the mistakes that led to the "boxing in" of the United States so that no choice was left but to proceed with such a risky and unnecessary venture. Second, it should assess the ambiguities and deficiencies in the Bosnia peace plan that could jeopardize success -- and thus harm NATO and U.S. credibility.<sup>9</sup>  Third, it should consider future legislation building on the momentum and principles established in the December 13 House and Senate votes and designed to achieve the following: <p><ul><li> Lay down additional markers by which success or failure can be measured. This would help prevent "mission creep" and provide further basis for an exit strategy.

<li> Establish some basic guidelines for implementing the agreement. This could include such do's and don'ts as:  a) avoid trying coercively to disarm unthreatening factions; b) refuse to get involved in nation-building or to police civilian activities; c) avoid trying to guarantee either the return of refugees or certain outcomes in elections; d) resist the temptation to launch military operations in search of alleged war criminals; and e) use overwhelming force when challenged.

<li> Express strong support for NATO and NATO expansion. The President has implied that opposition to the Dayton plan is tantamount to weakening the credibility of America's commitment to NATO. Congress should make it clear that this is not true. In no way should the reservations of Congress be interpreted as doubting the validity or credibility of NATO. A vote of confidence in NATO and for expanding the alliance not only would help to deflect the President's unfair and unwise depiction of doubters as isolationists or opponents of NATO, but also would help to inoculate NATO against the fallout of the possible failure in Bosnia that so many in Congress fully expect.
</ul><p>
Opposing IFOR is not equivalent to isolationism or opposition to NATO. In fact, it may turn out to be the Clinton Administration's misguided adventurism that destroys NATO. The President has embarked upon a hazardous course for good or ill; he alone is now responsible to the American people for what happens. But he needs to be reminded, even as Americans defer to his role as commander in chief, that U.S. credibility and prestige are too valuable to be squandered or debased by improper use.

<title>The Duma Elections: Russian Reformers Beware -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE DUMA ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN REFORMERS BEWARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<sup>1 </sup><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 443<br>
December 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The elections to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on December 17 
demonstrated that democratic politics are beginning to take root in Russia. A healthy majority of 
eligible voters participated, and the political elites are learning that they must appeal to them. 
However, many voters clearly are frustrated with the hardships of economic transition, crime, and 
corruption. The impressive performance by Gennady Zyuganov's communists at the polls, and the 
high public opinion ratings of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate, 
indicate that the pro-market forces may lose control of the executive branch in the June 1996 
presidential elections. If this occurs, there is a danger that the 1995 elections will be the first and the 
last free and "clean" parliamentary elections in Russia for a long time.
<p>
<b>More Hardline Duma.</b> Half of the Duma (225 seats) is elected by party lists. To win 
seats in this half, parties had to gain more than five percent of the popular vote. Only four parties 
met this test. The Russian voters gave the communists 22 percent and Zhirinovsky's "Liberal 
Democratic" Party of Russia (LDPR) 11 percent. The centrist Our Home is Russia, headed by 
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, received 10 percent of the vote, and the reformist 
<i>Yabloko</i> Party led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky just over 7 percent. This means that the 
communists, together with their allies, now have about 30 percent of the votes, and the nationalists, 
over 17 percent.
<p>
The other half of the Duma is made up of single-seat constituencies, in which the candidate with the 
majority of votes in the district takes the parliamentary post. In these single-mandate districts, the 
voters elected 77 independent (unaffiliated) candidates, 58 communists, 20 deputies from the 
Agrarian Party (which is closely tied to the communists), 14 from <i>Yabloko</i>, and 10 from 
Our Home is Russia. Former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reformist Democratic Choice 
of Russia and the communist-nationalist Power to the People party, led by former USSR Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, won 9 seats each. Zhirinovsky's LDPR took only one seat. A few seats 
in the single-mandate districts were gained by members of smaller parties which did not clear the 
five percent barrier. 
<p>
Out of the total of 450 Duma seats, the communists lead with 150 seats, while LDPR, Our Home is 
Russia, and <i>Yabloko</i> all have approximately 50 each. Given these figures, the communists 
most probably will manage to appoint a chairman and take control of several key committees. The 
leadership of the Duma will consist of the chairman and leaders of the factions which will be 
formed. Given its composition, the Duma is likely to prove confrontational toward the executive 
branch.
<p>
<b>Achievement for Russian Democracy.</b> The 1995 democratic process was more 
transparent and fair than in 1993: this Duma was elected for a full four-year term; no parties were 
banned from running, and a total of 42 parties and movements participated in the race. The 1993 
Duma was elected for two years only, and several parties were banned from running after the 
Russian Supreme Soviet was disbanded by Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
The Russian public showed maturity by heeding the call to participate in the voting process. The 
voting rate was a respectable 65 percent, 15 percentage points higher than in 1993. The lowest 
voting rate was among the young, who tended to cast their ballots for democrats, Zhirinovsky, or 
centrists, but not for the communists. Older voters leaned more heavily toward the communists.
<p>
The elections were "clean" by Russian standards. This is the assessment of foreign and Russian 
observers and of the generally free mass media. There were very few reports of minor tampering 
with the process; three candidates, however, were killed or died in suspicious traffic accidents. 
<p>
There were quite a few surprises in the elections. A number of parties had been expected to do 
better. Among these were Gaidar's Democratic Choice of Russia (4.1 percent), Women of Russia 
(4.6 percent), and the Congress of Russian Communities led by the charismatic General Alexander 
Lebed (4.3 percent). 
<p>
The poor performance of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia suggests that the 
voters do not trust the government's execution of reforms, and they are tired of the ubiquitous crime 
and corruption. Our Home is Russia won the most votes in Moscow (20 percent), where the 
country's capital is most heavily concentrated, and where the reforms already have produced wealth 
and opportunity. (Almost all of Moscow's single-mandate districts returned democratic candidates.) 
Voters in the provinces, where the reforms have not yet generated jobs and have weakened the 
social safety net, gave the communists and nationalists their heaviest gains.
<p>
<b>The Presidency: Yeltsin Still in the Running.</b> Many Russians believe that the Duma 
elections were but a dress rehearsal for the real political fight that will take place in the presidential 
elections next summer. The Duma elections highlighted Communist Party chief Zyuganov and his 
ability to command the still-formidable Party machine. They also showcased Zhirinovsky's shrewd 
political instincts, setting him up as the other presidential front-runner in June. On the other hand, 
Alexander Lebed, whose ads featured the General shooting an arsenal of infantry weapons, has 
shown that he is a better soldier than a politician. 
<p>
According to public opinion polls, both Chernomyrdin and President Boris Yeltsin are not favored 
to do well if they run for president. Both men are in their sixties in a country where the average 
male life expectancy is only 57. Yeltsin's ill health remains a central theme in Russian politics. 
Nevertheless, well-informed sources in Moscow predict that he will still run in June, even though 
he trails Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, Lebed, and Yavlinsky in the presidential election ratings.
<p>
Yegor Gaidar's poor showing eliminated him as the presidential hopeful of the Russian center-right. 
Grigory Yavlinsky, who consistently has distanced himself from the Yeltsin administration and 
won high personal approval rating among the voters, remains the only democratic presidential 
hopeful. However, he will need to work hard to win the first round of presidential elections by 
becoming a consensus candidate of the reformers -- not a very likely development. 
<p>
<b>Conclusion.</b> The fight for Russia's democratic future is far from over. The democrats and 
reformers are split and hardly capable of resisting the dual nationalist and communist threat. While 
the elections showed that Russians can behave like good democrats, they showed also that voters 
do not necessarily elect good democrats. The reformers have to increase their popular appeal, and 
do it very fast. If these had been presidential elections, Gennady Zyuganov would now be the leader 
of Russia and working to turn back the clock, with disastrous consequences for his own country and 
her neighbors near and far. Come June, this may be a very real scenario if democrats do not unite.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Terrorism is a cancer that has plagued the Middle East for
decades. It is now metastasizing into new and more deadly forms that
pose grave challenges to the United States and the West. Middle
Eastern terrorists are striking outside their home region, boldly
attacking high-profile targets, and killing in a more indiscriminate
manner. Last year the U.S., which had never suffered a major terrorist
attack on its soil by Middle Eastern terrorists, was rocked by the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, which killed six
Americans and wounded over 1,000. This was the highest casualty toll
ever recorded for a single terrorist incident. A subsequent bombing
campaign against targets in New York City was stopped in its tracks in
June 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombing embodies several ominous trends in
Middle Eastern terrorism. It epitomizes the drift toward large-scale,
indiscriminate violence. It also underscores the degree to which
radical Islamic extremists have supplanted radical nationalists, such
as the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the chief Middle Eastern
terrorist threat to the U.S. Moreover, radical Islamic groups are
inciting Sunni (orthodox) Muslims to support revolutionary terrorism
in Egypt and Algeria, just as radical Shia Muslims were incited by the
Iranian revolution. Finally, the Sudanese connection of several of the
bombers demonstrates how Sudan has become the "new Lebanon" -- a host
for a wide variety of terrorist groups and an important bridge between
Shia Iranian radicals and the new wave of Sunni Arab radicals.
<P>
     The United States cannot afford to ignore the wake-up calls
presented by the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled Iraqi-
sponsored assassination attempt against former President George Bush
during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait. The taboo against international
terrorist attacks inside the country and against important national
symbols has been broken. Washington must lead a concerted
international effort to make such terrorist attacks more difficult,
more costly to the perpetrators, and more risky for the states that
back them.

<P>
     The Worldwide Spread of Middle Eastern terrorism. The U.S. is by
no means the only country to feel the wrath of Middle Eastern
terrorists in recent months. In July, 117 people were killed in a
series of four bombings in nine days that swept Argentina, Panama, and
Britain. Most, if not all, of this carnage is believed to be the
handiwork of the world's most deadly terrorist organization --
Hezbollah (Party of God), an Iranian-sponsored and Syrian-backed
terrorist group based in Lebanon that perpetrated the October 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. In August, radical
Islamic terrorists seeking to overthrow the Algerian government killed
two Chinese and five French citizens in Algeria, as part of a
terrorist campaign against foreigners that has claimed 60 lives since
September 1993.
<P>
     Yet, the U.S. and its citizens have been the world's foremost
targets of international terrorism in recent years. The FBI estimates
that 32 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1982 to 1992 were
targeted against Americans or American property. (FBI Terrorist
Research and Analytical Center, "Terrorism in the United States:
1982-1992" (Washington D.C., 1993), p. 11.) Middle Eastern terrorism
remains the greatest terrorist threat to the United States. Although
some 20 percent of all international terrorist incidents from 1982 to
1992 have been traced to Middle Eastern quarrels, these incidents have
accounted for about 35 percent of terrorist-related fatalities.
(Testimony of terrorism expert Brian Jenkins before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Security,
International Organizations and Human Rights, March 12,1993.) Middle
Eastern terrorist incidents repeatedly have drawn the U.S. into
international crises. State-sponsored terrorist attacks against
Americans have triggered U.S. military retaliation against Iran, Iraq,
and Libya. 
<P>
     Iran has been the foremost state sponsor of terrorism since the
1979 Iranian revolution. But terrorist attacks against Western targets
dropped off after the 1989 election of President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was more interested in rebuilding Iran with Western
help than in exporting revolution. Now that Rafsanjani is steadily
losing ground to more radical leaders in a bitter internal power
struggle, there could be an escalation of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
Indeed, this may already have started to happen with Hezbollah's July
bombing campaign.
<P>
     Despite the growing danger, the Clinton Administration has failed
to mount a credible effort to stem the tide of terrorism. Although it
pays lip service to counterterrorism, the Administration unwisely
remains wedded to a State Department reorganization plan that would
downgrade the Office of Counterterrorism and signal friends and foes
that fighting terrorism is not a high priority. To more fully protect
American citizens from the scourge of Middle Eastern terrorism, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
  <P>   The Administration should shelve its plan to downgrade the status
of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and make
terrorism a top permanent agenda item at the annual G-7 summits.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare.
<P>     Treating it as a purely criminal matter does not effectively
address the issue of state-supported terrorism.
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible.
 <P>   Raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military costs of
state terrorism to the point where they exceed the expected benefits.
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups. 
 <P>    Washington increasingly should apply public pressure on allied
governments, particularly in Europe, that appease terrorist states.
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
 <P>    The use or threat of force is an essential deterrent to state-
supported terrorism.
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism.
 <P>    Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey require firm U.S. support and
close cooperation against international terrorism.
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
 <P>    The FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies need to expand
their sources of human intelligence on international terrorism and
consult closely with allies and other concerned states.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.
<P>     Deportation proceedings should be streamlined, political asylum
requests should be screened more quickly and decisively and visas
should be denied to members of groups that use, support, or advocate
terrorism. Federal criminal penalties for visa and passport forgeries
should be toughened.
<P>
Work to restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist
groups thrive. 
  <P>   The U.S. should back efforts by the governments of Lebanon and
Afghanistan to roll back the influence of Islamic radicals and
dismantle terrorist training camps.
<P>
THE UPSURGE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST
<P>
     Middle Easterners are the prime suspects in a series of four
terrorist attacks against far-flung Western targets in July. On July
18 a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
killing 96 people and wounding more than 200. The next day a bomb
destroyed a commuter plane in Panama, killing 21, most of them Jewish
businessmen. A car bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in
Lebanon on July 27, wounding 13 people. The next day another car bomb
demolished the London offices of a Jewish charity organization.
<P>
     A previously unknown group calling itself Ansarallah (Partisans
of God) claimed responsibility for the Buenos Aires and Panama
bombings. American intelligence specialists believe that the group is
a subsidiary of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based radical Shiite terrorist
organization. Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, the leader of Hezbollah's most
militant faction, is suspected of being the leader of the group.
(Louise Lief, "Partisans of Terror," U.S. News and World Report,
August 8, 1994, p. 36.) There has been speculation that the attacks
were meant to derail the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, because the
bombings straddled Jordanian King Hussein's July trip to Washington to
sign a non-belligerency accord with Israel. A more likely explanation,
however, is that this spate of terrorism was a spillover of the
intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. 
<P>
     Hezbollah undoubtedly was smarting over Israel's capture of one
of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon on May 21. The radical
Islamic terrorists also may have been angry over Israel's June 2 air
strike that killed some 45 of its cadres in Lebanon. Israeli and
American intelligence officials are said to have little doubt that
Iran also was behind the July 18 Buenos Aires bombing. (Testimony of
Steven Emerson, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations
and Human Rights, August 1, 1994.) Up to 20 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, who train and equip Hezbollah forces, apparently were killed
in the June 2 air strike. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore World's
Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.) Iran
was implicated in a similar terrorist operation in Argentina that took
the lives of 29 people in March 1992. Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for that bombing, which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
possibly retaliating for an earlier Israeli attack that killed its
military chief. Electronic intelligence intercepts and an extensive
forensic investigation revealed that Iranian officials had helped
acquire the plastic explosives used in that 1992 bombing. (Steven
Emerson, "Diplomacy That Can Stop Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal,
July 22, 1994, p. A10.) Iran also has been implicated in the July 18
Buenos Aires bombing by an Iranian defector questioned by Argentine
criminal investigators. (Gabriel Escobar, "Iranian Diplomats Said to
Be Suspects in Blast at Argentine Jewish Center," The Washington Post,
July 29, 1994, p. A27.) 
<P>
     The string of bombings in July greatly concerns U.S.
counterterrorism officials. They are worried about the ability of
Hezbollah terrorists to mount a sustained, coordinated, and well-
organized terrorist campaign against targets all over the globe. (The
car bomb used against the Israeli Embassy in London was delivered by a
woman, a fact that has led some experts to doubt involvement of
Hezbollah in that particular attack, because the organization
previously has condemned the use of women in terrorist actions.
Nevertheless, the possibility that a secular terrorist group carried
out that attack does not necessarily let Iran off the hook, because
Tehran has used secular groups such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - General Command.) The attacks apparently
were planned well in advance and utilized local support networks for
reconnaissance and preparation. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore
World's Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.)
The July 19 mid-air bombing of a Panamanian commuter plane is
especially troubling because it may be the first suicide terrorist
attack on an airliner. (British counterterrorism officials secretly
have warned British airlines to be on guard for suicide bombers. Jamie
Dettner, "Airlines Warned of Suicide Bombers," The Washington Times,
August 8, 1994, p. A15.) 
  <P>   

 THE CONTINUING MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
<P>
     The February 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center was a
curious terrorist operation. On the one hand it was well-planned and
professional; the terrorists were able secretly to construct and
deploy a massive truck bomb. On the other hand, it was a surprisingly
amateurish operation. The four terrorists convicted of the attack took
unnecessary risks, such as giving a correct name and address when
renting a vehicle for delivering the bomb.
<P>
     So far, no foreign state has been found responsible for the World
Trade Center attack. But there are disturbing shreds of circumstantial
evidence that point to possible Iranian or Iraqi involvement. Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and
possibly directed the bombers, long has been on the Iranian payroll,
according to Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of CIA
counterterrorism operations. (Bill Gertz, "Iran Backs Terrorist
Networks in U.S., Canada," The Washington Times, March 17, 1993, p.
A7.) Sheik Omar regularly was given large sums of money by Iran's
intelligence service, using Iran's delegation to the United Nations as
a conduit. ("Washington Whispers," U.S. News and World Report, May 31,
1993, p. 23.) U.S. government investigators discovered that about
$100,000 was transferred to the suspects before the bombing from banks
in foreign countries, including Iran, but it is not known if this was
payment for the attack or for other activities such as propaganda or
recruitment. (Ralph Blumenthal, "$100,000 Is Linked to Trade Center
Suspects," The New York Times, April 25, 1993, p. 41.)
<P>
     Other signs point toward Iraq. For instance, the attack took
place during the second anniversary of the ground offensive against
Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Terrorist attacks launched on
anniversaries historically have been a common means of seeking
vengeance in the Middle East. Another troubling circumstance is that
Ramzi Yousef, who apparently set the plot in motion, entered the U.S.
in 1992 on an Iraqi passport on a trip that began in Iraq. Moreover,
Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi suspect who cooperated with the FBI and was
released from jail, later flew back to Iraq and is now believed to be
living in Baghdad. Many New York law enforcement officials reportedly
believe that Iraq was involved, although they can not prove it.
(Laurie Mylroie, "World Trade Center Bombing -- The Case of Secret
Cyanide," The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 1994, p. A16.)
<P>
     Iraq also would seem to have more to gain from such a terrorist
operation than Iran. Saddam would have had a strong incentive to
punish the U.S. for its role in Desert Storm. Iraq also may have
wanted to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and its arch-rival
Iran by casting suspicion on Tehran for the bombing. This would
strengthen Iraq's perceived value in the Middle East as a bulwark
against revolutionary Iran, an argument Iraqi diplomats have made in
attempts to persuade members of the United Nations Security Council to
lift the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. (Iraq also had
sponsored a similarly deceptive terrorist operation in June 1982, when
it ordered the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian
terrorist group, to shoot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, an act
which provoked Israel to punish the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) by invading Lebanon to destroy its base camps. The payoff for
Iraq was that the Israelis dealt Iraq's rival Syria a sharp military
setback in the course of the Lebanon War, and precluded Syria from
joining its ally Iran in its 1980-1988 war with Iraq.)
<P>
     A final disquieting consideration was the nature of the World
Trade Center bomb itself. Not only was the bomb huge, loaded with
1,200 pounds of explosives, but it was customized with compressed
hydrogen to magnify the blast and sodium cyanide to create a poisonous
cloud after the explosion. (The sodium cyanide apparently burned up
completely instead of turning into a gas. See Mylroie, op. cit., p.
A16.) A bomb that big and sophisticated has never before been
detonated by a terrorist group that did not have state sponsorship or
long-standing experience in building explosive devices.
<P>
THE NEW BREED OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombers are a new breed of terrorist.
Unlike the tightly disciplined cells that dominated terrorism in the
past, they functioned in a loosely organized ad hoc manner. Three of
the six charged with the bombing were dedicated followers of Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the fiery spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, a
radical fundamentalist movement that has waged a terrorist campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian government.
<P>
     At least three of the six bombers had fought in the war in
Afghanistan against Soviet and Afghan communists. The Sheik also made
at least three visits there since 1980 and two of his sons reportedly
fought there. Thousands of Muslims from roughly 40 countries flocked
to Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion. (Pakistani
officials estimated that at least 2800 foreign Muslims remained in
Afghanistan in 1993. Edward Gargan, "Where Arab Militants Train and
Wait," The New York Times, August 11, 1993, p. A8.) Radicalized
veterans from the Afghan war -- called by some journalists the
"University of Jihad"(Holy War) -- have returned home and have become
the spearheads of radical Islamic movements in Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bosnia, Egypt, Sudan, and many other places around the world. (Tim
Weiner, "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield," The New York Times
Magazine, March 13, 1994, p. 53.) Hundreds of these "Afghanis" are
being trained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sudanese training
camps.
<P>
     Radical Islamic movements have mushroomed not only in the Muslim
world, but also among Muslim immigrants in the West. The World Trade
Center bombers were all either recent immigrants or illegal aliens.
Although they may have been drawn to America by economic opportunities
and political freedoms, these terrorists rejected America's values and
what they considered to be its degenerate culture of materialism and
secularism. Rejecting assimilation into the resented society of their
host country, they were susceptible to incitement by Sheik Omar. What
they did mirrors what happened in several other terrorism cases, such
as Hezbollah's 1985-1986 bombing campaign in France and its bombings
in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994. In all three cases, small portions
of local immigrant communities provided support for the terrorist
operations. 
<P>
     Ironically, many radical Islamic movements outlawed in their own
countries have found sanctuary in Western countries. So long as they
are in the West, they cannot be arrested by the police back home. Like
Sheik Omar, leaders of these radical movements lambaste their host
countries while taking advantage of their open political systems to
travel freely, organize politically, raise funds, recruit new members,
support underground opposition movements in their home countries, and
sometimes to direct terrorist activities. Germany long has been a base
for Islamic extremists. (German intelligence officials estimate that
about 700 Arab extremists live there, along with over 42,000 other
foreign extremists. Jim McGee, "U.S. Pledges Global Pursuit in
Bombing," The Washington Post, March 13, 1993.) The U.S. has become a
safe haven for Hezbollah, the Islamic Group, Algerian fundamentalists,
and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli officials claim that Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement), the radical Palestinian Islamic group
that is using terrorism to undermine the nascent Palestinian-Israeli
peace, actually is directed from a headquarters in the United States.
(Ehud Yaari, "A Safe Haven for Hamas in America," The New York Times,
January 27, 1993.) 
<P>
     The support networks that these terrorist groups are forming
inside the U.S. for fundraising, recruitment, and propaganda
activities could become the nucleus for terrorist attacks on American
soil. These potential terrorists are dangerous because, unlike hit
teams dispatched from the Middle East, they are now blending into
Western societies where they have established personal and communal
roots. U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that "sleeper cells"
already established inside the U.S. could lie dormant for many years
until activated for specific terrorist actions. (The FBI discovered a
sleeper cell of the Abu Nidal organization inside the U.S. in 1986 and
arrested four Palestinian members in April 1993 after one member of
the group murdered his daughter. See William Carley, "A Trail of
Terror," The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Moreover, the decentralized structure of many of the radical
Islamic movements makes it difficult for host governments to detect,
defend against, or apprehend terrorists lurking within these
movements. The loosely linked informal webs of Islamic militants,
often organized in small groups around a charismatic cleric, are
harder to track and infiltrate than the more rigidly organized
Palestinian terrorist groups that have been a major threat for
decades. The Palestinian groups had a more straightforward
organization and often were corrupt and therefore susceptible to
bribery. They also were easier to penetrate because infighting between
rival organizations led them to provide information on each other.
<P>
     The new breed of radical Islamic terrorist is more intractable,
less likely to betray other terrorists, and more unpredictable. In
contrast to long-established Palestinian terrorist groups who had more
predictable targets and objectives, Islamic radicals have more unclear
motives and a wider variety of targets. They not only attack Israel,
secular governments in Muslim countries, and states that support the
secular regimes they oppose, they also target reporters with whom they
disagree, intellectuals they despise (such as Salman Rushdie, the
author of The Satanic Verses), and Western cultural institutions such
as the American University in Beirut. 
<P>
     Most Palestinian terrorist groups refrained from assaulting
Americans or launching attacks on American soil. The reason: they
wanted to influence American public opinion to change U.S. foreign
policy and to drive a wedge between Israel and America. They made the
cold-blooded political calculation that killing Americans would hurt,
rather than help their political cause. 
<P>
     This self-imposed restraint often is not as strong among Islamic
militants. This new breed of terrorist is hostile not only to American
policies, but to many American values. For example, they reject
secular law and democracy and the separation of church and state. They
view American culture as a threat to Islamic piety and revile what
they perceive to be the degenerate secular and materialist bias of
American society. To Islamic radicals, the U.S. is the villainous
successor of the European colonial empires that have sought to
dominate the Middle East since the time of the crusades. In their holy
war against the West, terrorism is an acceptable instrument for
carrying out the will of God. Because they are motivated by
apocalyptic zeal, and not sober political calculations, their choice
of possible targets is much wider and more indiscriminate than that of
other terrorists. Since they are less predictable, they can be more
dangerous than Palestinian or other Middle Eastern terrorists.
<P>
     Islamic radicals also often have a different audience in mind
than Palestinian nationalists. Instead of using terrorism to influence
Western powers to change their policies, they often use terrorism to
punish Western powers and inspire other Muslims to rise up against the
West. This focus on the Muslim audience rather than an American
audience helps explain how the bombers of the World Trade Center could
rationalize their bloody actions. The bombing was meant to demonstrate
the power of Islamic radicals and the vulnerability of the U.S., not
to lead the U.S. to rethink its Middle East policy.
<P>
THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM
<P>
     The Middle East is a hotbed of state-sponsored terrorism. Five of
the seven states that have been branded by the U.S. government as
sponsors of international terrorism-- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and
Syria--are located in the region. (Cuba and North Korea are the other
two on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.)
Moreover, 22 of the 41 major international terrorist groups described
in the State Department's annual report on global terrorism are based
in the Middle East. (See U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global
Terrorism: 1993, April 1994, Appendix B.) The region not only is
infested with more terrorist groups than any other region, but these
groups subscribe to a wider variety of ideologies and causes, ranging
from Marxism to secular Arab, Armenian, Kurdish, and Palestinian
nationalism to radical Islamic fundamentalism. Each year the Middle
East is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, with most of the
spillover afflicting Western Europe. (Between 1980 and 1989 over 400
terrorist actions spilled over from the Middle East to other regions,
with 87 percent of these actions occurring in Western Europe. Paul
Wilkinson, "Terrorism, Iran and the Gulf Region," Jane's Intelligence
Review, May 1992, p. 222.)
<P>
     Because of the heavy concentration of terrorist states and
terrorist groups, most new trends in terrorism develop in the Middle
East, then spread quickly to other regions. Radical Palestinian groups
such as the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. When improved airport security measures made hijacking
more difficult, Palestinian groups such as the 15 May organization
were in the forefront of the trend of airline bombings. 
<P>
     Most terrorist groups prior to 1970 were autonomous organizations
of indigenous dissidents that pursued their own agendas without
outside support. (Neil Livingston and Terrell Arnold, eds., Fighting
Back: Winning the War Against Terrorism (Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath,
1986) p. 12.) During the 1970s the Soviet Union and its satellites
greatly expanded their support for terrorist groups. Moscow often used
Middle Eastern client states such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and the
former People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen as intermediaries
to mask Soviet arms, training, intelligence, and logistical support
for a wide variety of terrorist groups. 
<P>
     The radical Arab states, which regularly used terrorism as a tool
of repression against internal opposition, sought their own terrorist
surrogates to wield as weapons against Israel, Western powers, and
other Middle Eastern states. Libya, Syria, and Iraq courted
Palestinian splinter groups or created their own Palestinian puppet
organizations to buttress their claims to Arab leadership. These
puppets also were used as proxy terrorists who, if caught, would not
bring down retaliation on the head of the state sponsor.
<P>
     The 1979 Iranian revolution brought Iran into the forefront of
international terrorism. Iran organized, trained, equipped, and
financed Shiite revolutionary movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon
and Ad Dawa (The Call) in Iraq and the Gulf States. Under Iranian
supervision, Hezbollah unleashed a lethal terrorist campaign in 1983
to drive the Western peacekeeping forces out of Lebanon, bombing the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April and the Marine barracks in October.
After Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected President in 1989,
Iranian support for international terrorism was toned down and the
Western hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon gradually were released
by the end of 1991. But assassinations of Iranian exile leaders
continued at an alarming pace. Government-sponsored terrorism also was
supplemented by terrorism financed by Iranian so-called charitable
foundations, many of which are controlled by radical clerics opposed
to many of Rafsanjani's policies. One of these, the Fifteenth of
Khordad Foundation, has put a $2 million bounty on the head of Salman
Rushdie, condemned to death as a blasphemer by Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. (Rushdie's publishers, translators, and bookstores that sell his
books have been targeted for terrorist attacks. In the last five years
113 people have died in violence related to the Rushdie affair in more
than 20 countries. See Bizhan Torabi, "The West, Iran Deadlocked Over
Rushdie," The Washington Times, February 16, 1994, p. A13.) 
<P>
     President Rafsanjani's power steadily has been eroded by radical
rivals who have gained dominance over the Iranian parliament. He is a
lame duck, prohibited by the Iranian constitution from running for re-
election for a third term in 1996. As the struggle to succeed him
intensifies, there is a good chance that Iran's support for terrorism
will escalate. The West and the U.S. make convenient targets for hard-
liners in their fight to seize power. In fact, Iran already has become
more aggressive in supporting terrorism. In addition to suspected
Iranian involvement in the July bombings in Buenos Aires and London,
three Iranians await trial in Thailand for an attempt to bomb the
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. In April, the British government
charged that it had clear evidence of growing contacts between Irish
Republican Army terrorists and Iranian embassies in Europe. (In
addition to providing money and possibly arms to the I.R.A., London
charged that Iran also was building links to the Syria-based Japanese
Red Army. Stewart Dalby, "Iran Accused of Terrorist Links," Financial
Times, April 29, 1994, p. 1.) In May, more than 300 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards arrived in Bosnia to organize Muslim militias and
terrorist groups, according to U.S. intelligence sources. (Bill Gertz,
"Iranians Move into Bosnia to Terrorize Serbs," The Washington Times,
June 2, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
TOWARD A MORE EFFECTIVE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY
<P>
     The U.S. has an historic opportunity to crack down on Middle East
terrorism. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Empire
have deprived Middle Eastern terrorist states of superpower backing.
The embryonic peace agreement between Israel and the PLO has reduced
one source of terrorism, although Palestinian rejectionists both
within and outside the PLO continue their terrorist war against
Israel. Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent isolation has
constrained state support from that quarter, particularly as long as
Baghdad moderates its policies in an effort to wriggle out of U.N.-
sponsored economic sanctions. Iran and Libya are isolated and beset by
substantial economic problems caused in part by low oil prices.
Sudan's radical Islamic regime is drained by a long-running civil war
and a grim economic situation. Syria faces a precarious future as
President Hafez al-Assad, not in the best of health, plots his
personal political endgame. 
<P>
     All of these Middle Eastern regimes, which have exported so much
terrorism-related misery, are simultaneously vulnerable on a number of
different fronts. In the past they have been able to shrug off Western
demands to halt their support of terrorism. But now that they have
lost Soviet backing and have become increasingly dependent on the West
for economic support, that is no longer true. The West now has more
influence and leverage over these states. Moreover, many of these
regimes are threatened by internal political opposition, or the
prospect of such opposition in the near future. The U.S. and other
Western powers, therefore, gain potential leverage by supporting or
threatening to support opposition groups hostile to terrorist regimes.
<P>
     While the threat or actual use of force is the ultimate deterrent
to terrorism, experienced terrorist states and groups often are
successful in concealing their responsibility for terrorist outrages
to avoid military reprisals. To deter terrorism, Washington must
convince its allies and other concerned states to increase the
diplomatic, economic, military,and political costs of state-supported
terrorism. A unified Western campaign to curtail Middle Eastern
terrorism now has a greater chance for success than ever before. Only
the U.S. can forge and lead such a coalition. To build an
international consensus to combat terrorism and to follow through and
act on that consensus, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration must drop its short-sighted plan for
downgrading the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. This
reorganization plan would fold that office into a new Bureau for
Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime and demote the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism from the current equivalent of an Assistant Secretary
of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. L. Paul Bremer,
a former Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, noting that the
office would be "gutted," charged that: "The Clinton Administration
has neglected the terrorist threat, with our public officials paying
only lip service to the problem." (L. Paul Bremer, "With Assad, Talk
About Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 1994, p. A10.)
   <P>
	Congress has temporarily blocked the Administration's plans.
Under the leadership of Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), the
House voted on April 18, 1994, to retain an independent Office of
Counterterrorism. But the Administration has not given up on its
reorganization plan, which originated in the Bush Administration as a
cost-cutting measure. 
<P>
     Congress will again have to wrestle with the reorganization plan
after April 30, 1995, when the Gilman amendment expires. At that time,
Congress should consider insisting that the Administration permanently
shelve its plans to downgrade State's counterterrorism office. This
office instead must be given the bureaucratic clout to champion tough
anti-terrorism policies against other bureaus in the State Department,
or in other departments, that have little or no interest in combating
terrorism. Therefore, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who is the
U.S. government's senior full-time counterterrorism official, must
have direct access to the Secretary of State, and not be relegated, as
the Administration plans, to the bottom of a cumbersome reporting
chain. To secure the diplomatic clout that is needed to impress U.S.
allies and terrorist nations, the Coordinator should be restored to
the status of ambassador-at-large, as was the case during the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
     Washington should aggressively raise the profile of the
counterterrorism issue by injecting it into every multilateral
diplomatic forum and every high-level bilateral meeting with officials
from allied governments or terrorist regimes. The U.S. should ensure
that the issue of terrorism appears automatically on the agenda at
every G-7 summit. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism should become a
permanent fixture at the summits as the prime mover in a multilateral
working group on counterterrorism.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare. 
<P>
     Terrorism is the most ubiquitous kind of low-intensity conflict.
Yet, it is too often treated primarily as a law enforcement issue.
While bringing the rule of law to bear on terrorists is desirable, it
is not always possible, particularly when terrorists are being
protected by a state sponsor. In cases of state-supported terrorism,
which the CIA estimates comprise up to 80 percent of all international
terrorism, it is not realistic to rely solely on law enforcement
agencies to fight terrorists. 
<P>
     State-supported terrorism is in effect an act of war and should
be approached as a form of surrogate warfare. The U.S. should not
unnecessarily hobble itself in this war against terrorism by treating
state-sponsored foreign terrorists the same as it treats domestic
terrorist groups. Counterterrorist forces should not require courtroom
standards of evidence before they take action. Adopting a narrow
legalistic approach to fighting terrorism would lead to American
paralysis and terrorism would proliferate unchecked. 
<P>
     The U.S. should make use of the full arsenal of its weapons
against terrorism by relaxing self-imposed restrictions on special
operations. For example, Executive Order No. 11905, signed in 1976,
was designed to prohibit assassinations of foreign leaders, but it
also has been interpreted as prohibiting commando assaults on
terrorist groups. This executive order should be refined to permit
such special operations, particularly against terrorist groups that
have killed Americans in the past, such as Hezbollah or the Abu Nidal
organization. Counterterrorist teams also should be deployed to
apprehend terrorists in anarchic areas such as Lebanon or Afghanistan,
and not just in international waters or airspace.
<P>
     The U.S. should also make greater use of non-violent covert
actions, such as the dissemination of disinformation to create
dissension inside terrorist groups and psychological warfare to
aggravate the terrorists' sense of vulnerability and to encourage
distrust of their state sponsors. Agents of influence, wherever they
can be inserted, would help to disrupt terrorist operations and turn
terrorists against each other. Sabotage operations also should be
launched against the safehouses, logistics support networks, and
financial assets of terrorist groups. 
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern states have relied heavily on state-sponsored
terrorism because it is a cost-effective tool to their foreign
policies. The U.S. should work with its allies and other concerned
states to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military
costs of supporting terrorism so high that it outweighs the strategic
benefits.
<P>
Diplomatic sanctions. 
<P>
     Countries victimized by terrorism in the past have broken
relations or reduced the size of the diplomatic mission of the state
sponsor. This helps limit the threat of terrorism, because much of it
is directed, supported, and financed by intelligence personnel
operating under diplomatic cover. But diplomatic sanctions usually
have been unilateral, ad hoc responses that have had little effect on
terrorist states. Washington should propose an agreement among the G-7
and NATO allies that would require all of them to expel large numbers
of diplomats, if not break diplomatic relations completely, with
states that support terrorist attacks. Moreover, diplomatic personnel
of these states should be expelled for each confirmed terrorist attack
by a surrogate terrorist group. 
<P>
     This measure would raise the public uproar over terrorism and
increase the costs of each attack. This may give pause to some
terrorist states, particularly those such as Iran and Sudan, that want
the West to bail them out of dire economic predicaments. At a minimum,
reducing the diplomatic presence of terrorist states will make it
harder for them to support terrorism out of their embassies. For
example, the expulsion of diplomats greatly undermined Iraq's ability
to export terrorism during the 1991 Gulf War. 
<P>
     Regardless of whether it can gain G-7 support for such an
agreement, the U.S. should pressure its allies to pare down the
diplomatic presence of Iranian and Sudanese diplomats in their
countries. Diplomats from Iran and Sudan have been implicated in the
July bombing in Buenos Aires and in the 1993 bomb plots in New York
City. The Iranian diplomatic presence particularly should be cut back
in Germany and Venezuela, which are centers for Iran's intelligence
and terrorist networks.
<P>
     Economic sanctions. Washington should persuade its allies to
participate in developing a multilateral version of the State
Department's list of states that support terrorism. Once placed on the
list, a terrorist state should be denied economic assistance, arms
sales, and preferential trade privileges from all participating
states. Further, the allies would be committed to voting against
financial aid for that state in international financial institutions
such as the World Bank. If Western Europe and Japan presented a united
front in threatening to impose sanctions, it could have a sobering
effect on the five Middle Eastern terrorist states. All, with the
possible exception of Libya, will require Western or Japanese economic
assistance, loans or renegotiation of existing loans in the near
future. Iran already is staggering under the financial burden of its
$30 billion foreign debt. Iraq owes foreign creditors more than $14
billion, Syria owes $16.5 billion, and Sudan's foreign debt is in
excess of $16 billion. Now that the Soviet Union has dissolved, they
have no place else to go. The U.S. should convince its allies to take
advantage of their financial leverage and elevate counterterrorism to
the forefront of economic aid and loan renegotiation decisions. 
<P>
     Trade sanctions against terrorist states will be more difficult
to extract from the Western Europeans and Japanese since they see
Iran, Iraq, and Libya as potentially lucrative export markets and
important sources of oil supplies. France and other countries already
are impatient to lift the U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq.
To block this, Washington should make Iraq a high-priority test case
for Western anti-terrorism cooperation. The U.S. should stress Iraq's
abortive plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April 1993 (For more on Iraq's assassination plot,
see James A. Phillips, "Punish Saddam's Terrorism With Military
Action," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 358, June 11,
1993.) and Baghdad's continuing terrorist attacks on the Kurds and on
U.N. personnel in northern Iraq. To test Baghdad's intentions,
Washington should request the extradition of Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi who
participated in the plot to bomb the World Trade Center, who returned
to Iraq. (Yasin was seen outside his father's house in Baghdad by an
ABC News reporter earlier this year. Mylroie, op. cit.) If Baghdad
balks at observing the terms of the extradition treaty that it signed
with the U.S., then it clearly will be in violation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution Number 687 (April 1991), which called on Iraq to
abandon its support of terrorism. This violation could become a
justification for maintaining the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
<P>
     The Europeans have been more cooperative in imposing economic
sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the
1988 Pan Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. But these
U.N.-imposed sanctions have fallen short of an embargo on Libyan oil.
The U.S. should expand the sanctions to include Libya's oil exports.
Washington should work through the U.N. Security Council to impose an
oil export regime similar to the one imposed on Iraq: oil revenues
would be funneled into a U.N.-administered escrow account that could
be used to pay reparations to the families of victims of Libyan
terrorism. This could be a model to punish other terrorist states that
block international efforts to apprehend terrorists.
<P>
     Another terrorist state that is extremely vulnerable to concerted
international economic sanctions because of its crumbling economy is
Sudan. It already has sought to appease the West by turning over the
notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias
"Carlos the Jackal," to France on August 15. (Carlos was a terrorist
playboy who had outlived his usefulness to Syria, which had harbored
him until 1991. Carlos's leftist politics did not endear him to
Sudan's radical Islamic regime.) 
<P>
     Iran will be a more difficult case because of the reluctance of
America's allies, particularly Germany and Japan, to sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests in exporting to Iran. Now that Iran is
having difficulty repaying its debts, foreign creditors may be more
willing to consider trade sanctions against Tehran. In any case, the
U.S. could strengthen its case for economic sanctions against Iran if
President Clinton blocks the proposed $750 million sale of up to 20
Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran and prohibits U.S. oil companies, the
largest purchasers of Iranian oil, from buying Iran's oil exports.
(American oil companies currently are prohibited from importing
Iranian oil into the U.S. but are allowed to buy it for resale
elsewhere. See James Phillips, "Containing Iran," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 980, March 9, 1994.)
<P>
     The U.S. should drive up the prospective political costs of
state-sponsored terrorism. This can be done by supporting opposition
groups in countries that engage in international terrorism. All Middle
Eastern terrorist states have generated domestic opposition.
Washington should provide diplomatic, economic, and even military
support to the most viable opposition groups in terrorist states. The
Kurds in Iraq, the resistance movements in southern Sudan, pro-Western
exile groups and the increasingly restless Azeris, Baluch, and Kurds
in Iran, and Libyan dissidents all merit increased American and
Western support. The Assad regime in Syria has brutally eliminated
most domestic opposition, but President Assad's persistent health
problems and the recent death of his son and heir apparent, Basil, has
increased uncertainty about the political durability of Syria's
minority Alawite regime. Although there may be no viable opposition
inside Syria in the short run, the U.S. should increase its diplomatic
support for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian domination. 
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups.
<P>
     Western Europe has borne the brunt of the spillover of Middle
Eastern terrorism, yet historically has been reluctant to take
determined action against it. Too often, European states have sought
to appease terrorist states and cut separate deals with them, rather
than take a unified stand against terrorism. Last October, Germany
hosted a visit by Iran's Minister of Intelligence and Security, Ali
Fallahiyan, the overseer of much of Iran's terrorist operations.
France appeased Iran last December by expelling two suspected Iranian
terrorists whose extradition had been sought by Switzerland for the
1990 assassination of an Iranian opposition leader in Geneva. 
<P>
     The U.S. must drive home to its allies that appeasement of
terrorism is a self-defeating policy that only encourages more
terrorism. France may be ripe for persuasion, now that an upsurge in
terrorist attacks against French citizens in Algeria led Paris to
crack down on exiled Algerian radicals in France in early August.
France now criticizes the U.S. and Germany for allowing exiled
Algerian radicals to continue to operate freely within their borders.
Washington should cooperate with France and closely monitor the
activities of Algerian radicals in the U.S., while pressing Paris to
support greater international cooperation in isolating terrorist
states, particularly Iran.
<P>
     Germany and Japan, the two biggest exporters to Iran, are the
weak links in Western efforts to isolate Iran. Both states argue that
they aid Iranian "moderates" by maintaining good trade and diplomatic
relations with Iran. This rationale has grown increasingly threadbare
in view of Iran's continued support of terrorism. Besides, Iran's
"moderates" are losing ground to more radical elements in Tehran who
are likely to escalate terrorism unless confronted with firm
international pressures. The U.S. should strongly warn Germany and
Japan, first privately and increasingly in public, that appeasement
only encourages Iran and other terrorist states to believe that
terrorism is cost-free. Worse, by conducting preferential trade
relations with Iran and granting it foreign aid and loans, Germany and
Japan are subsidizing Iran's terrorism. 
<P>
     Washington also should press its allies to establish a high-level
central office for coordinating counterterrorism policies. These
offices could act as liaisons with allied counterterrorism agencies.
Modeled on the U.S. Office of Counterterrorism, these offices would
help raise the profile of counterterrorism as an international issue
and make international cooperation more effective and timely.
Washington also should lobby all its allies to adopt stiffer penalties
for terrorism, including longer jail terms and the seizure of the
assets of terrorist groups or states. The Europeans, in particular,
should be pressed to stop releasing terrorists before their sentences
have been completed.
<P>
     Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to halt the flow of
financial aid to radical Islamic movements. Substantial sums of money
from private Saudi religious foundations and individuals have
bankrolled Sheik Abdul Rahman and other radical fundamentalists.
Riyadh placed restrictions on the flow of these funds outside the
country in 1993 but needs to more carefully control the activities of
the Islamic foundations to prevent them from meddling in the internal
affairs of other Muslim countries. 
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
<P>
     The use or threat of use of military force is essential for
punishing and deterring state-sponsored terrorism. The military
response should be designed to raise the cost of terrorism above the
price a terrorist state is willing to pay. The U.S. should not get
bogged down in a tit-for-tat exchange by limiting its attacks merely
to terrorist training camps. Instead, it should strike targets that
the terrorist state highly values, such as its internal security
forces and secret police. For example, if Iran or one of its
surrogates, such as Hezbollah, lashes out at an American target, the
U.S. should not content itself with destroying a few easily
replaceable terrorist camps in Lebanon or Iran. Rather, the U.S.
should attack Iran's Revolutionary Guards which train terrorists and
provide internal security, as well as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence
and Security.
<P>
     A sharp and decisive military reprisal not only can have a
deterrent effect on the terrorist state attacked, it also can have a
strong demonstration effect on other states that support terrorism.
For example, the April 1986 air strikes against Libya had a
significant impact on Syria as well as Libya. According to the State
Department, Libya reduced its involvement in international terrorism
from 19 incidents in 1986 to six in 1987, while Syrian involvement
fell from 34 in 1985 to six in 1986 and to one in 1987.
<P>
     Special operations are an important option for fighting
terrorists close to innocent civilians, in hostage rescue operations,
and in efforts to apprehend terrorist leaders. The Pentagon must make
an effort to maintain the strength and readiness of the Special
Operations Command which includes the elite "Delta Force," Army
Special Operations Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Reconnaissance teams,
and a special assault unit from the 101st Air Assault Division. These
forces should be periodically dispatched on anti-terrorism training
exercises in friendly Middle Eastern states to give them familiarity
with the region and experience with desert warfare. 
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorists pose much more of a threat to secular
and moderate regimes in the Muslim world than to the West. Islamic
revolutionary movements have used terrorism to undermine and
demoralize ruling governments, polarize societies, and intimidate
secular opposition. Terrorists have become the shock troops of Islamic
revolutionary movements seeking the overthrow of the governments of
Egypt and Algeria. The U.S. has a major stake in both countries. A
radical Islamic revolution in either of them would send shock waves
throughout the Arab world.
<P>
     Washington should steadfastly support the governments of Egypt
and Algeria in their efforts to reach an accommodation with political
opposition groups while firmly suppressing terrorists. American
diplomats should not meet publicly with radical Islamic leaders
because this could undermine the existing government. Nor should
Washington permit radical Islamic leaders, such as Tunisian
revolutionary Rashid el-Ghanoushi, to visit America unless they reject
terrorism. Nor should it pressure any government to enter talks with
any group that supports terrorism. Whenever possible the U.S. should
share its intelligence on terrorist groups and their supporters with
the governments battling revolutionary terrorists.
<P>
     In addition to supporting moderate Arab regimes threatened by
terrorism, the U.S. should cooperate closely with Turkey and Israel in
combating terrorism. Both countries are valuable sources of
intelligence on international terrorism and should be furnished with
American intelligence on terrorist activities in a timely manner. The
U.S. also should maintain relentless pressure on Syria to halt its
support for the Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, two terrorist groups that have killed
scores of Turks. Moreover, Washington should strongly back Israel's
demand that any Syrian-Israeli peace agreement must include guarantees
that Syria will cease its support for Palestinian terrorists and help
end Hezbollah's rein of terror in Lebanon. 
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
<P>
     Fighting terrorism effectively requires detailed and timely
intelligence about the operations of terrorist groups, their support
networks and their state sponsors. The FBI has made effective use of
intelligence information to pre-empt at least 78 terrorist plots since
1982. (Estimate provided by Kevin Giblin, Senior Intelligence Officer
for Counterterrorism, FBI, in an August 3, 1993 Forum of the U.S.
Global Strategy Council entitled "Terrorism: The Next Phase?") But the
new breed of radical Islamic terrorists, organized in informal
amorphous groups, presents a new challenge for intelligence-gathering.
To maintain and expand its intelligence network, the FBI should make a
systematic effort to recruit Arab-Americans and American Muslims.
<P>
     The CIA needs to upgrade the volume and quality of its human
intelligence on terrorist groups and states. It must develop a more
extensive network of agents dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence
and infiltrate terrorist groups on a long-term basis. The CIA should
make every effort to recruit American and foreign personnel with
extensive knowledge of and experience in the cultures and societies of
their terrorist adversaries. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center,
created in 1986 by President Reagan after the hijacking of TWA flight
847, should be expanded and devote more resources to surveillance of
the new breed of radical Islamic terrorists. The National Security
Agency and various defense intelligence agencies should be directed to
give counterterrorism a higher priority in their intelligence-
gathering efforts. The Defense Department also should consider
dedicating more of its reconnaissance satellites to gathering
information on possible military targets related to terrorism, such as
terrorist bases and training camps in terrorist states and the Syrian-
controlled areas of Lebanon.
<P>
     In addition, the U.S. should improve its efforts to reward
informants who provide useful information about terrorist activities.
The State Department's International Counterterrorism reward program
provides monetary awards of up to $2 million for information on
terrorist activities against Americans. It has led to the defection of
more than ten terrorist informants and the prevention of nearly a
dozen acts of terrorism against Americans. This program should be
publicized more widely in the Middle East. A recent report that a
valuable informant was treated shabbily by the U.S. government is
disconcerting because it could lead the trickle of informants to dry
up. (See Jill Smolowe, "A Hero's Unwelcome," Time, May 9, 1994, p.
50.) Informants who risk their lives to provide important intelligence
should be promptly rewarded for their efforts.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. 
<P>
     Sheik Abdul Rahman and two of the World Trade Center bombers
entered the country illegally. They eventually were caught but were
allowed to remain in the country pending subsequent legal proceedings.
This situation is intolerable. Congress should reform the immigration
laws to accelerate deportation proceedings and simplify and
consolidate the lengthy procedural hearings and appeal system that
permit illegal and undocumented aliens to evade immigration controls.
Applicants for political asylum should be screened to weed out and
immediately deport those without a credible basis for asylum.
<P>
     Tougher penalties should be imposed on the production or use of
fraudulent passports and visas. Nine of the original 35 indictable
counts in the 1993 New York bombing plots involved visa or passport
offenses. The recently passed crime bill contains a measure that will
double the maximum prison terms for such crimes from 5 to 10 years
(and increase to 20 years if the documents were used to facilitate
terrorism) and boost fines from $2,000 to $250,000. A companion
measure sponsored by Representative Gilman, which currently is under
consideration by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow the
government to seize the assets of criminals convicted of creating or
using false documents for terrorism or drug smuggling. If passed, this
measure would make it harder for terrorists to obtain false documents.
<P>
     Finally, the U.S. government should automatically deny visas to
members of groups that advocate, support, or participate in terrorism.
Unfortunately, the 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act killed the
provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act
that allowed the U.S. government to restrict the entry into the U.S.
of members of a group deemed a threat to U.S. security. The State
Department now wrings its hands over denying visas solely because of
membership in a terrorist group. This loophole, which puts the nation
at risk, needs to be closed. Congress should pass legislation that
enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners because of
membership in terrorist groups rather than requiring proof of personal
involvement in terrorist acts, as is now the case.
<P>
Restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist groups
thrive.
<P>
     Many of the World Trade Center bombers were supporters of the
radical Afghan group Hezbi Islami (Party of Islam) led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, a virulently anti-Western Islamic militant. Some reportedly
were trained in Hezbi Islami camps and fought in the Afghan war. The
U.S. should drop its short-sighted hands-off policy in Afghanistan
that has led it to remain neutral in the fighting between Hekmatyar's
Islamic zealots and the provisional government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. With a limited commitment of financial aid, the
U.S. can greatly strengthen the ability of the moderate Afghan forces
to defeat Hekmatyar's drive to transform Afghanistan into a
revolutionary Islamic state. By bolstering Rabbani's regime, the U.S.
could help end the anarchy that gives terrorists a foothold in
Afghanistan. (See James Phillips, "Winning the Endgame in
Afghanistan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 181, May 18,
1992.)
 <P>
    In addition, Washington should press Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to
end their support of Hekmatyar.
<P>
     The U.S. also should revive its efforts to build a stable and
independent Lebanon. Syria has sought to keep the Lebanese weak and
divided to assure its own dominance there. It has vetoed the efforts
of the Lebanese government to extend its control into southern Lebanon
and disarm Hezbollah. The U.S. should insist that Syria abide by the
terms of the 1989 Taif agreement, which require Syria to withdraw its
40,000 troops to eastern Lebanon and permit the Beirut government to
extend its control over its own territory. Only then will Lebanon
cease to be a staging area for international terrorism.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorism has become more unpredictable and
audacious. Radical Islamic terrorists inspired by Iranian, Algerian,
and Egyptian revolutionary movements have overshadowed Palestinian
nationalist terrorists as a threat to the West. These new terrorists
often are supported by networks of radical Islamic activists who live
in Muslim communities in the West. Even more worrisome is the
training, arms, financial support, and guidance which radical Islamic
terrorists receive from such states as Iran and Sudan. 
<P>
     International terrorism is not likely to be eradicated, but it
can be weakened considerably if increased diplomatic, economic,
political, and military pressure is brought to bear on the state
sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. must lead an international campaign to
raise the costs of terrorism. This will require a coordinated, firm,
and relentless international effort. This kind of cooperation paid off
in disarming Iraqi terrorism during the Gulf War, and it can work
again. The U.S. must convince its allies that they now are involved,
whether they want to be or not, in an international war against
terrorism.
<P>
     To do so, the Clinton Administration must do more to stop
international terrorism. It must shelve its misguided plan to
downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, toughen
its approach to terrorist states, and remain vigilantly on guard
against terrorist movements. Only then will its allies sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests to advance the long-term security
interests of the West and other targets of Middle Eastern terrorists.

<h3>Tougher Law Enforcement Is Driving Down Urban Crime</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John J. DiIulio Jr.</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	Serious crime is declining in many big cities across America. That's the good news. Meanwhile, the country's largest and most violent cohort of young males will soon reach its crime-prone years. That's the bad news. But demography is not fate. Smarter law enforcement and tougher sentencing policies explain much of the recent drop in crime, and can minimize the damage from the next crime wave.
<p>	Between 1993 and 1994, the violent crime rate declined by 10 percent or more in eight of the 10 cities with the highest violent-crime rates (Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, Tallahassee, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, Jacksonville, and Pueblo, Colorado). In many cities, a sizable reduction in homicides accounts for much of the fall in these rates. For example, the number of murders in Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans together plummeted by 17 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year ago.
<p>	New York City and Houston have enjoyed truly phenomenal drops in serious crimes, including murder. In 1992 and again in 1993, more than 1,900 homicides were committed in the Big Apple. But in 1994 New York City's  murder count fell to 1,581. Through July 1995, it suffered fewer than 700 murders, and it continued to show declines of 10 percent or more in robberies, burglaries, and most other serious crimes. Likewise, the number of people murdered in Houston declined by 32 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with same period a year ago. Rapes in Houston decreased by 21 percent, robberies by 15 percent, and the overall violent crime rate by 7 percent.
<p>	While New York City and Houston are leading the pack, other cities are catching up. During the first half of 1995, for example, the overall crime rate was down by more than 16 percent in San Francisco, 10 percent in San Antonio, and 6 percent in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And the number of murders declined by more than 6 percent in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, 9 percent in Detroit, and 10 percent in Boston and St. Louis.
<p>	What is going on here? Some criminologists dismiss the recent improvement in the crime rate as a mere statistical fluke. But it is hard to imagine that these downward trends, occurring in consecutive years in given jurisdictions, could have happened by chance. Others insist that the slide in crime rates is greased by a dwindling population of teenage boys. There is something to this claim, but it ignores the inconvenient fact that Houston and some other places with growing populations of at-risk youth have nonetheless experienced sharp reductions in crime.
<p>	Finally, a few criminologists have rushed to relate the dive in crime rates to everything from a sudden surge in the efficacy of gun control laws (which is patently absurd) to changes in the patterns of drug use (for example, the decline in crack-cocaine use which, they insist, has had nothing to do with anti-drug law enforcement). One much-quoted criminologist has even declared, "What goes up must come down."
<p>
<b>Bratton's Law: Enforcement Counts</b>
<p>	In many cities, the decline in crime rates can be explained at least in part by law-enforcement efforts that capitalize on community crime-fighting initiatives and take bad guys off the streets. I call this explanation Bratton's Law in honor of New York City's police commissioner, William Bratton. Like most veteran professionals in the justice system, Bratton understands perfectly well that crime rates are not determined solely by what cops, courts, and corrections agencies do. But his impatience with criminological cant about the inefficacy of policing practices and sentencing policies on crime rates is both ennobling and enlightening. Three brief examples illustrate Bratton's Law in action.
<P><ul>

<li><b>Jacksonville.</b> In July 1991, Harry L. Shorenstein became state attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Jacksonville, Florida. At that time Jacksonville was besieged by violent crime, much of it committed by juvenile offenders. In the year before Shorenstein arrived, juvenile arrests had risen by 27 percent, but most young habitual criminals were released quickly. Jacksonville's finest were doing their best to remove serious young criminals from the streets, but the rest of the system was not following suit.
<p>	Then, in March 1992, Shorenstein instituted an unprecedented program to prosecute and incarcerate dangerous juvenile offenders as adults. In most parts of the country, juvenile criminals for whom the law mandates adult treatment are not actually eligible for state prison sentences and are routinely placed on probation without serving any jail time. But Shorenstein's program was for real. He assigned 10 veteran attorneys to a new juvenile-prosecutions unit. Another attorney, funded by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, was assigned to prosecute repeat juvenile auto thieves.
<p>	By the end of 1994, the program had sent hundreds of juvenile offenders to Jacksonville's jails and scores more to serve a year or more in Florida's prisons. Jacksonville's would-be juvenile street predators got the message, and the effect of deterrence soon appeared in the arrest statistics. From 1992 to 1994, total arrests of juveniles dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. From 1993 to 1994, juvenile arrests increased nationwide and by over 20 percent in Florida. But Jacksonville had a 30 percent decrease in all juvenile arrests, including a 41 percent decrease in juveniles arrested for weapons offenses, a 45 percent decrease for auto theft, and a 50 percent decrease for residential burglary. Although Jacksonville still has a serious violent crime problem, the number of people murdered there during the first half of this year declined by 25 percent compared with the same period a year ago.<p>
<li><b>Houston.</b> Almost a thousand officers have been added to the city's police force since 1991. Led by Police Chief Sam Nuchia, Houston has a cost-effective police overtime program that puts more cops on the street when and where they are most needed. Residents of Washington, D.C., which fields the highest number of police officers per capita of any major city, know that more police manpower does not necessarily produce less crime or better police performance. But in Houston, Nuchia has used the additional manpower to jump-start community anti-crime activities.
<p>	To cite just one example, Houston's Citizen Patrol Program has operated in more than a hundred of the city's neighborhoods. Among other things, thousands of citizen patrollers have observed and reported suspicious or criminal behavior, from assaults to narcotics dealing to vandalism. Many once-troubled neighborhoods have gone as long as three consecutive months without needing to call for police service. Indeed, two recent studies found that Nuchia's enforcement efforts not only contributed to Houston's falling crime rates, but also improved police emergency response times, raised police productivity, and reduced citizens' fear of crime.<p>
<li><b>New York City.</b> Like Houston, New York City has greatly expanded its police force. Since 1990, the NYPD has grown by 7,000 officers. Under Bratton, police have been directed to crack down on public drinking, graffiti, vandalism, and other public disorders. The NYPD has beefed up action against street gangs and drug traffickers, returned to a policy of frisking suspects for guns and other weapons, and redoubled precinct-level efforts on a wide range of community-policing projects.<p>
	In the process, Bratton has promoted a new breed of precinct commanders and made them responsible for finding innovative, cost-effective ways of serving citizens and cutting crime in their neighborhoods. Despite recent corruption scandals, the precinct-based management system is working, NYPD morale is high, and New Yorkers are getting results that range from fewer aggressive panhandlers to fewer shootings and murders.
</ul><p>
<b>Criminologically Correct</b>
<p>	Why, then, are many criminologists so unwilling to admit that law enforcement can cut crime? Part of the answer is that more than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime. The most famous of these studies is the Kansas City, Missouri, "preventive-patrol" experiment.
<p>	For a year in the early 1970s, Kansas City was divided into three areas, each of which received a different level of auto patrol. The 1974 report on the experiment found that criminal activity, reported crime, rates of victimization (as measured in a follow-up survey), citizen fear, and satisfaction with the police were about the same in all three areas. Active auto patrol -- beats where cars cruised the streets conspicuously two to three times more frequently than in the control areas --  no difference at all.
<p>But academic experts who treat such negative findings as the final words on the subject are badly mistaken. George L. Kelling of Northeastern University, the father of the Kansas City research and many other major studies, recently cautioned his colleagues that "generalizing from a study about a specific tactic to other tactics or uses of police is inappropriate." As Kelling observed, "random preventive patrol by automobile for the purpose of creating a feeling of police omnipresence" is a relic of "mid-century policing tactics."
<p>Kellling has scolded those "academic ideologists" in criminology who "do not let research interfere with their conclusions." He keenly characterizes as defeatist dogma their views that "crime stems from basic structural features of society, and until problems like homelessness, social injustice, economic inequalities, and racism are addressed, police impact on crime will be negligible."
<p>	As a matter of ideology, denying that law enforcement counts in cutting crime may be trendy, but the policy science of the subject remains far from settled. Following an exhaustive review of the empirical literature on policing, David H. Bayley of SUNYAlbany recently concluded that there has never been "a rigorous, clear-cut test of the association between the visible presence of the police and crime rates." Bayley is now in the early stages of a quasi-experimental study designed to test this relationship while controlling for demographic and other variables related to the incidence of crime. Such fine-tuned research on patrol presence, policing strategies, crime rates, and other key variables has become possible only in the past few years with the development of computer-assisted information systems for police dispatching and management.
<p>	Bayley's cutting-edge research will help to identify the general conditions under which tactics and increases in police manpower can curb public disorders and cut crime. For now, there is no solid evidence to dismiss, and every practical reason to uphold, Bratton's Law.
<p>
<b>Wattenberg's Law: Prison Works</b>
<p>	By the same token, there is tremendous empirical support for another proposition that many criminologists reflexively reject: Sentencing policies that keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars contribute mightily to reductions in crime.
<p>	I call this proposition Wattenberg's Law in honor of Ben Wattenberg, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a nationally syndicated columnist. As Wattenberg has quipped, "A thug in prison can't shoot your sister." Whatever else incarceration buys us in the way of criminal deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution, it most definitely pays dividends by preventing crimes that prisoners would commit if they were free.
<p>	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported that fully 94 percent of state prisoners have committed one or more violent crimes or served a previous sentence in jail or on probation. Between 1980 and 1993, violent offenders were the greatest contributors to state prison population growth.
<p>	Even so, today more convicted violent offenders are serving time on probation and parole than in prison. About a third of all violent crime arrestees are on probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest. Recent studies by me and others estimate that most prisoners commit between 12 and 21 serious crimes a year when on the loose.
<p>	From 1980 to 1992, the aggregate violent-crime rate in the 10 states where incarceration climbed the most decreased by 8 percent. In the 10 states with the lowest increases in incarceration, violent crime soared, in aggregate, 51 percent. A study published in Science calculated that in 1989 alone, the increased use of imprisonment spared Americans an estimated 66,000 rapes, 323,000 robberies, 380,000 assaults, and 3.3 million burglaries. In a research report targeted against California's three-strikes law (life without parole for thrice-convicted felons), the RAND Corp. conservatively estimated that the measure would spare Californians about 340,000 serious crimes a year.
<p>	Nationally, state prisoners convicted of violent crimes who were released in 1988 had served an average of only 43 percent of their sentences in confinement. Violent convicts released in 1992 had served an average of 48 percent of their time behind bars. And violent offenders released from state prisons this year will have served, on average, 50 to 52 percent of their time in confinement. This slow but steady increase in incarceration is the result of a nationwide trend toward tougher sentencing policies, and has already spared millions of Americans from serious crimes.
<p>	It is not yet possible to calculate precisely how much tougher incarceration policies have contributed to falling crime rates in particular cities. But in explaining New York City's falling crime rate, consider the fact that roughly half of New York's state prison population, and an even larger fraction of its violent offender population, comes from New York City. Over the last decade, the Empire State's prison rolls have more than doubled, and the amount of time served behind bars by violent and repeat criminals has increased by as much as 50 percent.
<p>
<b>DiIulio's Law: Be Prepared</b>
<p>	Apparently, it takes a Ph.D. in criminology to doubt that keeping dangerous criminals incarcerated cuts crime and to wonder whether releasing any significant fraction of the nation's 1 million prisoners tonight would result in more serious crime tomorrow.
<p>	But criminologists are right about one thing: Americans are sitting on a demographic crime bomb. Most predatory street crimes are committed by men under 25. Today there are about 7.5 million males aged 14 to 17. By the year 2000, we will have an additional 500,000. About 6 percent of young males are responsible for half the serious crimes committed by their age group. Thus, in five years we can expect at least 30,000 more young murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets than we have today. Worse, since the 1950s each generational cohort of young male criminals has committed about three times more crime than the one before. Despite the recent decline in murder rates, homicides committed by 14- to 17-year-olds between 1985 and 1993 increased by 165 percent (more for minority males). The next wave of homicidal and near-homicidal violence among urban youth is bound to reach adjacent neighborhoods, inner-ring suburbs, and even the rural heartland.
<p>	This crime bomb probably cannot be defused. The large population of seven- to 10-year-old boys now growing up fatherless, Godless, and jobless -- and surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults -- will give rise to a new and more vicious group of predatory street criminals than the nation has ever known. We must therefore be prepared to contain the explosion's force and limit its damage.
<p>	While there is some room for reasonable disagreements about policy tactics -- for example, whether the federal role in crime control should be expanded, or whether we should invest more in drug treatment or drug interdiction -- any effective anti-crime policy must advance one or more of three interlocking anti-crime strategies: hardening targets, targeting the hardened, and targeting resources.
<p>	<b>Hardening the Target.</b> Over the last decade or so, most Americans have taken steps to make the places where they live, work, go to school, or recreate impervious to crime. People have moved out of high-crime neighborhoods, installed anti-burglary devices, made crime-sensitive investment decisions, and lectured their children to be mindful of dangers. Businesses and the 32 million Americans who now live in privately governed residential communities have erected security gates and employed more than a million private security guards. 
<p>	Neighborhoods of every socioeconomic description have formed "town watch" associations and citizen patrol groups. And the poorest of the inner-city poor have battled the ACLU for the right to target-harden their homes, schools, and parks: They erect concrete barriers on streets frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes, evict convicted street thugs from public housing, install metal detectors, and institute random locker searches in public high schools, and more.
<p>	Though to a degree hard to quantify, such initiatives have contributed to recent decreases in crime rates and, over time, insulated us somewhat from the failures of our system of justice. But as the next crime wave approaches, we may well be nearing the limit of what private target-hardening measures can do to foster public safety.
<p>	Government at all levels, therefore, should do whatever can be done to bolster these protective measures. To offer just two of many possible examples, urban zoning decisions should begin to take into account the criminal consequences of permitting liquor outlets to be so heavily concentrated in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods. Likewise, urban enterprise zones make sense as ways of giving <i>de facto</i> tax credits to businesses willing to locate in high-crime places.
<p><b>Targeting the Hardened.</b> At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars. To consolidate and expand recent gains, we must be vigilant not only in pushing for truth-in-sentencing and three-strikes measures, but seeing to it that these laws are followed both in letter and in spirit.
	<p>Make no mistake: The counter-offensive against tougher sentencing policies is well underway. Aided and abetted by activist federal judges, prisoners' rights activists, journalists, and academic "experts," efforts are already being made to depict these laws as failures and to deny or disparage any suggestion that they have helped account for recent drops in crime rates.
<p>	But just ask the criminals. In California this year, within several months after the three-strikes law went into effect, an increasing number of parolees began to request inter-state transfers. Likewise, even before Washington State's three-strikes law hit the books in 1993, dozens of sex offenders called the Seattle Police Department with questions about what crimes might count as "strikes." As one career criminal told the detective in charge of the department's sex-offender unit, "It wasn't until [the three-strikes law] passed that I had to say to myself, 'Damn, these people are serious now.'"
<p>	As the next crime wave draws near, we must remain deadly serious about targeting hardened adult and juvenile criminals for arrest, prosecution, and incarceration. Anti-incarceration propagandists can be counted on to work overtime with much-publicized tales like the one about the California man whose "third strike" was stealing a slice of pizza from a child in a mall. They failed to note, however, that this criminal had four prior convictions.
<p>	Likewise, the anti-incarcerationists are sure to repeat canards about how tougher sentencing policies will bankrupt the country and result in massive prison overcrowding. In truth, we now spend less than half a penny of every tax dollar on prisons, and the costs of prisons can be reduced greatly by cutting back on inmate amenities and services that account for more than half of the prison budget in many states. 
<p>	As for "overcrowding," despite the growth in the prison population, fewer prisons today are operating over their rated capacity (the number of inmates they were designed to hold) than in 1990. And contrary to popular assertions, there is no systematic empirical evidence to show that double-celling raises the risk of prison disorders, inmate illness, or other serious problems.
<p>	Congress is taking steps to target the hardened, as it considers Title III of the Violent Criminal Incarceration Act adopted by the House last February. Known as the Stop Turning Out Prisoners or STOP law, this measure would prohibit activist federal judges from arbitrarily imposing prison caps that result each year in the early release of tens of thousands of dangerous criminals whose return to the streets results in murder and mayhem.
<p><b>Targeting Resources.</b> Whatever government does henceforth to combat crime should be done in a targeted fashion. It makes no sense, for example, to heed President Clinton's call for spending $8.8 billion in federal dollars for "100,000 cops." As I and many other analysts have proven, not only will that amount not pay for or even seed the funding of anything near 100,000 police officers, but the Justice Department's grant process is rigged to deliver lots of money to small cities that have enough cops and little crime. By the same token, however, it makes even less sense to follow the Republican alternative of dumping more than $10 billion on the states in open-ended anticrime block grants.
<p>	So here is DiIulio's Law: Over the next five years, as our euphoria over good news about crime fades and a public panic to "do something" about youth crime begins, let us prepare to honor the overarching conservative principle that government should never spend money it does not have for purposes it has not clearly articulated in order to generate results that cannot easily be evaluated.

	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."

<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."
