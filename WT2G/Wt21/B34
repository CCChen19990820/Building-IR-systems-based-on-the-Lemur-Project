in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves. A
<P>

company of women without men is, however, as dull as a company of men
<P>

without women.&quot;  And after telling some stories to prove his point,

<P>

he ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a fourth at
<P>

their dinner.
<P>

<P>

The ladies were rather amused at the man's assurances and after
<P>

some discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay,
<P>

as his society might prove entertaining.  &quot;But listen, friend,&quot;

<P>

said<A NAME = "AS14483"></A> Zobeida<A NAME = "BB14486"></A><A HREF = "SPP49.HTM#BB147421"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &quot;if we grant your request, it is only on condition
<P>

that you behave with the utmost politeness, and that you keep the
<P>

secret of our way of living, which chance has revealed to you.&quot; 
<P>

Then they all sat down to table, which had been covered by Amina
<P>

with the dishes she had bought.
<P>

<P>

After the first<A NAME = "AO14547"></A><A NAME = "AS14548"></A> few mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a golden<A NAME = "AB145427"></A> cup. 

<P>

She first drank herself, according to the Arab custom, and then
<P>

filled it for her sisters.  When it came to the porter's turn he
<P>

kissed Amina's hand, and sang a song, which he composed at the moment
<P>

in praise of the wine.  The three ladies were pleased with the song,
<P>

and then sang themselves, so that the repast was a merry one,
<P>

and lasted much longer than usual.
<P>

<P>

At length, seeing that the sun was about to set, Sadia said
<P>

to the porter, &quot;Rise and go; it is now time for us to separate.&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;Oh, madam,&quot; replied he, &quot;how can you desire me to quit you

&quot;Dog,&quot; cried the princess when she first caught sight of him,

&quot;you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourself
<P>

before me in this hideous shape.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;And you,&quot; retorted the lion, &quot;have not feared to break our 
treaty

that engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each other.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Accursed genius!&quot; exclaimed the princess, &quot;it is you by whom

<P>

that treaty was first broken.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I will teach you how to give me so much trouble,&quot; said the lion,

and opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her.  But the

princess expected something of the sort and was on her guard. 
<P>

She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his mane
<P>

repeated two or three words over it.  In an instant it became a sword,
<P>

and with a sharp blow she cut the lion's body into two pieces. 
<P>

These pieces vanished no one knew where, and only the lion's<A NAME = "AS262823"></A><A NAME = "BB262824"></A><A HREF = "SPP152.HTM#BB458120"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>

head remained, which was at once changed into a scorpion. 
<P>

Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpent
<P>

and gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was getting
<P>

the worst of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight. 
<P>

But in a moment<A NAME = "AO26339"></A><A NAME = "AS263310"></A> the serpent had become an eagle<A NAME = "AB263323"></A> more powerful still,

who soared up in the air and after him, and then we lost sight of
<P>

them both.
<P>

We all remained where we were quaking with anxiety, when the ground

opened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out, its hair

standing on end, and miauing frightfully.  At its heels<A NAME = "AO263919"></A><A NAME = "AS263920"></A> was a wolf<A NAME = "AB263927"></A>,
<P>

who had almost seized it, when the cat<A NAME = "AO264017"></A><A NAME = "AS264018"></A> changed itself into a worm<A NAME = "AB264029"></A>,
<P>

and, piercing<A NAME = "AO26415"></A><A NAME = "AS26416"></A> the skin<A NAME = "AB264111"></A> of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a tree,
<P>

hid itself in the fruit.  The pomegranate<A NAME = "AO264215"></A><A NAME = "AS264216"></A><A NAME = "AB264217"></A> swelled till it grew as
<P>

large<A NAME = "AO26433"></A><A NAME = "AS26434"></A> as a pumpkin<A NAME = "AB264311"></A>, and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery,
<P>

from which it fell into the court and was broken into bits. 
<P>

While this was taking place the wolf, who had transformed himself
<P>

into a cock, began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate as fast
<P>

as he could.  When all were gone he flew towards us, flapping his
<P>

wings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly his eye fell
<P>

on one which lay<A NAME = "AO26499"></A><A NAME = "AS264910"></A> on the bank<A NAME = "AB264917"></A> of the little canal that flowed
<P>

through the court; he hastened towards it, but before he could touch
<P>

it the seed<A NAME = "AO26517"></A> rolled into the canal and became a fish.  The cock
<P>

flung<A NAME = "AO26523"></A><A NAME = "AS26524"></A> himself in after the fish and took the shape of a pike<A NAME = "AB265229"></A>,
<P>

and for two hours they chased each other up and down under the water,
<P>

uttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing.  At length they
<P>

rose from the water in their proper forms, but darting such flames
<P>

of fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the palace should
<P>

catch fire.  Soon, however, we had much greater cause for alarm,
<P>

as the genius, having shaken off the princess, flew towards us. 
<P>

Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing our danger,
<P>

had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself.  As it was,
<P>

the Sultan's beard was singed and his face scorched, the chief
<P>

of the eunuchs<A NAME = "AO26627"></A><A NAME = "AS26628"></A><A NAME = "BB26629"></A><A HREF = "SPP169.HTM#BB50805"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> was burned to a cinder, while a spark deprived me
<P>

of the sight of one eye.  Both I and the Sultan had given up all
<P>

hope of a rescue, when there was a shout of &quot;Victory, victory!&quot;

<P>

from the princess, and the genius lay at her feet a great heap
<P>

of ashes.
<P>

<P>

Exhausted though she was, the princess at once ordered the little slave,

dig<A NAME = "AO27893"></A><A NAME = "AS27894"></A> up the ground underfoot, and thou<A NAME = "AB278917"></A> shalt find a bow of brass and
<P>

three arrows of lead.  Shoot the arrows at the statue, and the rider
<P>

shall tumble into the sea, but the horse will fall down by thy side,
<P>

and thou shalt bury him in the place from which thou tookest the bow
<P>

and arrows.  This being done the sea will rise and cover the mountain,
<P>

and on it thou<A NAME = "AO27949"></A><A NAME = "AS279410"></A><A NAME = "AS279411"></A><A NAME = "AB279412"></A><A HREF = "SPP278.HTM#BB834220"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> wilt perceive the figure of a metal<A NAME = "AB279427"></A> man seated
<P>

in a boat, having an oar in each hand.  Step on board and let
<P>

him conduct thee; but if thou<A NAME = "AO279613"></A><A NAME = "AS279614"></A><A NAME = "AB279615"></A> wouldest behold thy kingdom again,
<P>

see<A NAME = "AO27973"></A><A NAME = "AS27974"></A> that thou<A NAME = "AB27979"></A> takest not the name of Allah into thy mouth.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Having uttered these words the vision left me, and I woke,
<P>

much comforted.  I sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out of
<P>

the ground, and with the third shot the horseman fell with a great
<P>

crash into the sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that I
<P>

had hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me. 
<P>

I stepped silently in and sat down, and the metal man pushed off,
<P>

and rowed without stopping for nine days, after which land appeared
<P>

on the horizon.  I was so overcome with joy at this sight that I
<P>

forgot all the old man had told me, and cried out, &quot;Allah be praised! 

<P>

Allah be praised!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man
<P>

sank from beneath me, and left me floating on the surface. 
<P>

All that day and the next night I swam and floated alternately,
<P>

making as well as I could for the land which was nearest to me. 
<P>

At last my strength began to fail, and I gave myself up for lost,
<P>

when the wind suddenly rose, and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore. 
<P>

Then, placing myself in safety, I hastily spread my clothes out to dry
<P>

in the sun<A NAME = "AO28177"></A>, and flung myself on the warm ground to rest.

operation of this title) to a provision of part A of title IV, or a State plan under such part (or a provision of such a plan), including

<strong>This is a full-text facsimile of the original document.</STRONG>
<P>
<ul><ul><ul>  (B) Data<A NAME = "AO3599"></A> indicates that at least
half of the children born to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men.
Available<A NAME = "AO35947"></A> data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are
fathered by men over age 20.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (C) Surveys<A NAME = "AO3609"></A> of
teen mothers have revealed that a majority of such mothers have histories of
sexual and physical abuse, primarily with older adult men.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well documented
 as follows:</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (A) Young<A NAME = "AO3629"></A><A NAME = "AS36210"></A> women 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public<A NAME = "AB36245"></A> assistance and to spend more 
years on welfare once enrolled. These combined<A NAME = "AO36271"></A><A NAME = "AS36272"></A> effects of  younger and longer' increase total AFDC<A NAME = "AB36289"></A> costs per household by 25 percent 
to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (B) Children<A NAME = "AO3639"></A><A NAME = "AS36310"></A> born out-of-wedlock have a substantially higher
risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth<A NAME = "AB36351"></A>
weight.</ul></ul></ul>
 <p><ul><ul><ul> (C) Children<A NAME = "AO3649"></A> born out-of-wedlock are
more likely to experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more
child abuse, and neglect.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (D) Children<A NAME = "AO3659"></A><A NAME = "AS36510"></A> born
out-of-wedlock were more likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower
educational<A NAME = "AB36539"></A> aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents
themselves.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (E) Being born out-of-wedlock
significantly reduces the chances of the child growing up to have an intact
marriage.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (F) Children<A NAME = "AO3679"></A> born out-of-wedlock
are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (9) Currently<A NAME = "AO3688"></A> 35 percent of children in single-parent homes were
born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in
single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 percent). While many
parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their
control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless,
the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well
documented as follows:</ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (A) Only<A NAME = "AO3699"></A> 9 percent of
married-couple families with children under 18 years of age have income below
the national poverty level. In contrast, 46<A NAME = "AO36956"></A> percent of female-headed
households with children under 18 years of age are below the national poverty
level.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (B) Among single-parent families,
nearly  1/<A NAME = "AO37021"></A><A NAME = "AS37022"></A><A NAME = "AS37023"></A>2  of the mothers who never married received AFDC<A NAME = "AB37041"></A> while only  1/5
of divorced mothers received AFDC<A NAME = "AB37060"></A>.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (C)
Children<A NAME = "AO3719"></A> born into families receiving welfare assistance are 3 times more
likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood than children not born into
families receiving welfare.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (D) Mothers<A NAME = "AO3729"></A><A NAME = "AS37210"></A> under
20 years of age are at the greatest risk of bearing low birth<A NAME = "AB37239"></A> weight
babies.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (E) The younger the single-parent
mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (F) Young<A NAME = "AO3749"></A><A NAME = "AS37410"></A> women who have children before finishing high<A NAME = "AB37425"></A> school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a longer 
period of time.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public<A NAME = "AO37519"></A> cost of births to teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent children 
program, the food<A NAME = "AO37555"></A><A NAME = "AS37556"></A><A NAME = "AS37557"></A><A NAME = "AB37558"></A> stamp program, and the medicaid<A NAME = "AB37569"></A> program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (H) The absence<A NAME = "AO37611"></A><A NAME = "AS37612"></A> of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school<A NAME = "AB37643"></A> performance and peer adjustment.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (I) Children<A NAME = "AO3779"></A><A NAME = "AS37710"></A><A NAME = "AS37711"></A><A NAME = "AB37712"></A> of teenage single parents have lower cognitive scores, lower educational<A NAME = "AB37733"></A> aspirations, and a greater likelihood of
 becoming teenage parents themselves.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (J) Children<A NAME = "AO3789"></A> of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children from 
intact 2-parent families.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (L) Neighborhoods<A NAME = "AO3809"></A> with larger percentages of youth aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent 
households have higher rates of violent crime.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (M) Of those youth<A NAME = "AO38113"></A> held for criminal offenses within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived primarily in a
 home with both parents. In contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9<A NAME = "AO38171"></A> percent of the 62,800,000 children in the Nation's 
resident population were living with both parents.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention<A NAME = "AO38248"></A><A NAME = "AS38249"></A> of
 out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birth are very important Government<A NAME = "AB38283"></A> interests and the policy contained 
in part A <A NAME = "AO382102"></A><A NAME = "AS382103"></A>of title IV<A NAME = "AB382109"></A> of the Social Security Act (as amended by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the crisis.</ul></ul>
<p><ul>  Except as otherwise specifically provided, wherever in this title<A NAME = "AO38319"></A> an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to or 
repeal of a section or other provision, the reference<A NAME = "AO38361"></A> shall be considered to be made to that section or other provision of the Social 
Security Act.</ul>
<p><h3>SEC. 103. BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES.</h3>
<p><ul>  (a) IN GENERAL--  Part A of title IV (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is

When I reached the bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace,
<P>

as brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that I had ever seen,

<P>

with a long<A NAME = "AO20717"></A><A NAME = "AS20718"></A> gallery supported by pillars of jasper<A NAME = "AB207121"></A><A HREF = "SPP273.HTM#BB819014"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, ornamented with
<P>

capitals of gold.  Down this gallery a lady came to meet me,
<P>

of such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought only
<P>

of her.
<P>

<P>

To save her all the trouble possible, I hastened towards her,
<P>

and bowed low.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Who are you?  Who are you?&quot; she said.  &quot;A man or a genius?
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;A man, madam,&quot; I replied; &quot;I have nothing to do with genii.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;By what accident do you come here?&quot; she asked again with a sigh. 

<P>

&quot;I have been in this place now for five and twenty years, and you are

<P>

the first man who has visited me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Emboldened by her beauty and gentleness, I ventured to reply,
<P>

&quot;Before, madam, I answer your question, allow me to say how grateful I

<P>

am for this meeting, which is not only a consolation to me in my own
<P>

heavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier,&quot;

<P>

and then I told her who I was, and how I had come there.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Alas, prince,&quot; she said, with a deeper sigh than before, &quot;
you have
<P>

guessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this
<P>

gorgeous place.  I am the daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle,
<P>

of whose fame you surely must have heard.  At my father's desire I was
<P>

married to a prince who was my own cousin; but on my very wedding day,
<P>

I was snatched up by a genius, and brought here in a faint. 
<P>

appear of such a dense blackness.
<P>

<P>

As may be supposed--continued the pilot--the mountain sides
<P>

are very rugged, but on the summit<A NAME = "AO276215"></A><A NAME = "AS276216"></A> stands a brass<A NAME = "AB276223"></A> dome supported
<P>

on pillars, and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse,
<P>

with a rider on his back.  This rider wears a breastplate of lead,
<P>

on which strange signs and figures are engraved, and it is said
<P>

that as long as this statue remains on the dome, vessels will
<P>

never cease to perish at the foot of the mountain.
<P>

<P>

So saying, the pilot began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing their
<P>

last hour had come, made their wills, each one in favour of his fellow.

<P>

<P>

At noon next day, as the pilot had foretold, we were so near to the
<P>

Black Mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of the ships
<P>

and dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible noise. 
<P>

A moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the crews with them. 

<P>

I alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was driven ashore
<P>

by the wind, without even a scratch.  What was my joy on finding
<P>

myself at the bottom<A NAME = "AO27789"></A> of some steps which led straight up the mountain,
<P>

for there was not another inch to the right or the left where a man
<P>

could set his foot.  And, indeed, even the steps themselves were
<P>

so narrow and so steep that, if the lightest breeze had arisen,
<P>

I should certainly have been blown into the sea.
<P>

<P>

When I reached the top I found the brass dome and the statue exactly
<P>

as the pilot had described, but was too wearied with all I had
<P>

gone through to do more than glance at them, and, flinging myself
<P>

under the dome, was asleep in an instant.  In my dreams an old man
<P>

appeared to me and said, &quot;Hearken, Agib!  As soon as thou<A NAME = "AO278825"></A><A NAME = "AS278826"></A><A NAME = "AB278827"></A> art awake

<P>

Hearing my words, the young man recovered himself, and when I had ended,

<P>

he said, &quot;The reasons, Prince, that have caused me to be buried
<P>

in this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise you. 
<P>

My father is a rich merchant, owning much land and many ships,
<P>

and has great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceased
<P>

mourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth.
<P>

<P>

&quot;At length one day he dreamed that the following year a son would
<P>

be born to him, and when this actually happened, he consulted
<P>

all the wise men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant. 
<P>

One and all they said the same thing.  I was to live happily
<P>

till I was fifteen, when a terrible danger awaited me, which I
<P>

should hardly escape.  If, however, I should succeed in doing so,
<P>

I should live to a great old age.  And, they added, when the statue
<P>

of the brass horse on the top of the mountain of adamant is thrown
<P>

into the sea by Agib, the son of Cassib, then beware, for fifty days
<P>

later your son shall fall by his hand!
<P>

<P>

&quot;This prophecy<A NAME = "AO28686"></A><A NAME = "AS28687"></A><A NAME = "AS28688"></A><A NAME = "AB28689"></A> struck the heart<A NAME = "AB286816"></A> of my father with such woe, that he

<P>

never got over it, but that did not prevent him from attending
<P>

carefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago,
<P>

my fifteenth birthday.  It was only yesterday that the news
<P>

reached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had been
<P>

thrown into the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this
<P>

underground chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising to
<P>

fetch me out when the forty days have passed.  For myself, I have
<P>

no fears, as Prince Agib is not likely to come here to look for me.&quot;

<P>

<P>

I listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of my
<P>
<P>

<p><h4><center>TITLE  -- -BLOCK GRANTS FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</center></h4>
<p><h3>SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h3>
<p><ul>  The Congress<A NAME = "AO3405"></A> makes the following findings:</ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (1) Marriage<A NAME = "AO3418"></A> is the foundation of a successful society.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (2) Marriage<A NAME = "AO3428"></A> is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (3) Promotion<A NAME = "AO3438"></A><A NAME = "AS3439"></A><A NAME = "AB34310"></A> of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (4) In 1992, only<A NAME = "AO34412"></A><A NAME = "AS34413"></A> 54 percent of single-parent families with
children had a child<A NAME = "AB34436"></A> support order established and, of that 54 percent, only
about one-half received the full amount due. Of the cases<A NAME = "AO34477"></A><A NAME = "AS34478"></A> enforced through
the public<A NAME = "AB34487"></A> child support enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload
has a collection.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul> (5) The number of individuals receiving aid to
families with dependent children (in this section referred to as  AFDC') has
more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of these recipients are
children. Eighty<A NAME = "AO34576"></A><A NAME = "AS34577"></A>-nine percent of children receiving AFDC<A NAME = "AB34590"></A> benefits now live in
homes in which no father is present.</ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul> (A)(i) The
average monthly number of children receiving AFDC benefits--</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>  (I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>  (II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>  (III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>  (IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (ii) While the number<A NAME = "AO35113"></A><A NAME = "AS35114"></A> of children receiving AFDC<A NAME = "AB35123"></A> benefits
increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total<A NAME = "AO35144"></A> number of
children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5
percent.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (B) The Department<A NAME = "AO35211"></A><A NAME = "AS35212"></A><A NAME = "AS35213"></A><A NAME = "AB35214"></A> of Health and
Human Services has estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC<A NAME = "AB35243"></A>
benefits within 10 years.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (C) The increase<A NAME = "AO35311"></A> in
the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the
increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage<A NAME = "AO35362"></A>
of live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, from 10.7
percent to 29.5 percent.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul>  (6) The increase of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented as
follows:</ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (A) It is estimated<A NAME = "AO35513"></A> that the rate of
nonmarital teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000
unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The overall rate<A NAME = "AO35568"></A><A NAME = "AS35569"></A> of
nonmarital<A NAME = "AB35574"></A> pregnancy rose 14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000
unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the
overall pregnancy<A NAME = "AO355125"></A><A NAME = "AS355126"></A><A NAME = "AB355127"></A> rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980
and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 to 117.6
pregnancies in 1991.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (B) The total<A NAME = "AO35611"></A> of all
out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to
29.5 percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by
the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul>  (7) An
effective<A NAME = "AO35710"></A><A NAME = "AS35711"></A><A NAME = "AS35712"></A> strategy to combat teenage<A NAME = "AB35721"></A> pregnancy must address the issue of male
responsibility, including statutory<A NAME = "AB35742"></A> rape culpability and prevention.  The
increase<A NAME = "AO35755"></A><A NAME = "AS35756"></A><A NAME = "AS35757"></A> of teenage<A NAME = "AB35762"></A> pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly
severe and is linked to predatory sexual<A NAME = "AB35791"></A> practices by men who are
significantly older.</ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>  (A) It is estimated that in
the late 1980's, the rate<A NAME = "AO35828"></A> for girls age 14 and under giving birth increased
26 percent.</ul></ul></ul> <p>

<P>


Next morning I dressed myself and began to look about me. 
<P>

There seemed to be no one but myself on the island, which was covered
<P>

with fruit<A NAME = "AO28215"></A><A NAME = "AS28216"></A><A NAME = "AB28217"></A> trees and watered with streams, but seemed a long distance
<P>

from the mainland which I hoped to reach.  Before, however, I had
<P>

time to feel cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the island,
<P>

and not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes, I hid
<P>

myself in the thick branches of a tree.
<P>

<P>

The sailors ran the ship into a creek, where ten slaves landed,
<P>

carrying spades and pickaxes.  In the middle of the island they stopped,

<P>

and after digging some time, lifted up what seemed to be a trapdoor. 
<P>

They then returned to the vessel two or three times for furniture
<P>

and provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old man,
<P>

leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age. 
<P>

They all disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining below
<P>

for a few minutes came up again, but without the boy, and let
<P>

down the trapdoor, covering it with earth as before.  This done,
<P>

they entered the ship and set sail.
<P>

<P>

As soon as they were out of sight, I came down from my tree,
<P>

and went to the place where the boy had been buried.  I dug up
<P>

the earth till I reached a large stone with a ring in the centre. 
<P>

This, when removed, disclosed a flight of stone steps which led
<P>

to a large room richly furnished and lighted by tapers.  On a pile
<P>

of cushions, covered with tapestry, sat the boy.  He looked up,
<P>

startled and frightened at the sight of a stranger in such a place,
<P>

and to soothe his fears, I at once spoke:  &quot;Be not alarmed, sir,
<P>

whoever you may be.  I am a king, and the son of a king, and will
<P>

do you no hurt.  On the contrary, perhaps I have been sent here
<P>

to deliver you out of this tomb, where you have been buried alive.&quot;

&quot;My daughter,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;I really had no idea you 
were
<P>

so clever.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the princess, &quot;there are many out-of-the-way 
things
<P>

it is as well to know, but one should never boast of them.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Well,&quot; asked the Sultan, &quot;can you tell me what must be done

<P>

to disenchant the young prince?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Certainly; and I can do it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Then restore him to his former shape,&quot; cried the Sultan. 
<P>

&quot;You could give me no greater pleasure, for I wish to make him
<P>

my grand-vizir, and to give him to you for your husband.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;As your Highness pleases,&quot; replied the princess.
<P>

<P>

Queen of Beauty rose and went to her chamber, from which she
<P>

fetched<A NAME = "AO25983"></A><A NAME = "AS25984"></A> a knife with some Hebrew<A NAME = "AB259815"></A> words engraven on the blade. 
<P>

She then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs, the little
<P>

slave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace,
<P>

and placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herself
<P>

standing in the centre of the court.  Here she traced a large
<P>

circle and in it wrote several words in Arab characters.
<P>

<P>

When the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the middle
<P>

of it and repeated some verses from the Koran.  Slowly the air
<P>

grew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble away,
<P>

and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the genius,
<P>
<P>

<P>


came to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighbours
<P>

of the envy he felt towards him.  But his character soon won him
<P>

the esteem of all, and the envious man's hatred grew, till he
<P>

came here with the deliberate intention of causing his death. 
<P>

And this he would have done, without our help, the very day before
<P>

the Sultan<A NAME = "AO23145"></A> has arranged to visit this holy dervish, and to entreat
<P>

his prayers for the princess, his daughter.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;But what is the matter with the princess that she needs
<P>

the dervish's prayers?&quot; asked another voice.
<P>

<P>

&quot;She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of 
Dimdim,&quot;
<P>

replied the first voice.  &quot;But it would be quite simple for this
<P>

holy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew!  In his
<P>

convent<A NAME = "AO23233"></A> there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail. 
<P>

Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of these
<P>

white hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the head
<P>

of the princess.  This will deliver her so completely that Maimoum,
<P>

the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The fairies<A NAME = "AO23295"></A><A NAME = "AS23296"></A> and genii<A NAME = "AB232911"></A><A HREF = "SPP192.HTM#BB576029"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> ceased talking, but the dervish did not forget
<P>

a word of all they had said; and when morning came he perceived
<P>

a place in the side of the well which was broken, and where he
<P>

could easily climb out.
<P>

<P>

The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him,
<P>

were enchanted at his reappearance.  He told them of the attempt on
<P>

his life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired into
<P>

his cell.  He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice
<P>

had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master.

The chief<A NAME = "AO25505"></A><A NAME = "AS25506"></A> of the eunuchs<A NAME = "AB255013"></A><A HREF = "SPP88.HTM#BB26629"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> bowed and left the room, ushering in a few
<P>

moments later the princess, Queen of Beauty.  Her face was uncovered,
<P>

but the moment she set foot in the room she threw her veil over
<P>

her head.  &quot;Sire,&quot; she said to her father, &quot;what can you be 
thinking
<P>

of to summon me like this into the presence of a man?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I do not understand you,&quot; replied the Sultan.  &quot;There is 
nobody
<P>

here but the eunuch<A NAME = "AO25579"></A><A NAME = "AS255710"></A><A NAME = "AB255711"></A><A HREF = "SPP89.HTM#BB26887"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, who is your own servant, the little slave,
<P>

and myself, yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach me
<P>

for having sent for you, as if I had committed a crime.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the princess, &quot;I am right and you are wrong.
<P>

This monkey<A NAME = "AO25625"></A><A NAME = "AS25626"></A><A NAME = "AS25627"></A><A NAME = "AB25628"></A><A HREF = "SPP85.HTM#BB256217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is really no monkey<A NAME = "BB256217"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF25628"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> at all, but a young prince who has
<P>

been turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius, son of
<P>

the daughter of Eblis.&quot;
<P>

<P>

As will be imagined, these words took the Sultan by surprise, and he
<P>

looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess. 
<P>

As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head to show that it
<P>

was true.
<P>

<P>

&quot;But how do you know this, my daughter?&quot; asked he.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Queen of Beauty, &quot;the old lady who took care 
of me
<P>

in my childhood was an accomplished magician, and she taught me
<P>

seventy rules of her art, by means of which I could, in the twinkling
<P>

of an eye, transplant your capital into the middle of the ocean. 
<P>

Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all persons
<P>

who are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was wrought.&quot;

<P>


But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters,
<P>

and in this I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputation
<P>

in this branch of knowledge that reached as far as India<A NAME = "AS198123"></A><A NAME = "AB198124"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB198924"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> itself.
<P>

<P>

Now the Sultan<A NAME = "AS19837"></A><A NAME = "AB19838"></A><A HREF = "SPP150.HTM#BB450312"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of the Indies, curious to see a young prince
<P>

with such strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father,
<P>

laden with rich presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court. 
<P>

My father, who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so
<P>

powerful a monarch<A NAME = "AO19877"></A>, and held besides that a little travel would
<P>

greatly improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly,
<P>

and in a short time I had set<A NAME = "AS198917"></A> out for India<A NAME = "BB198924"></A><A HREF = "SPP287.HTM#BB861613"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with the ambassador,
<P>

attended only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey,

<P>

and the badness of the roads.  However, as was my duty, I took
<P>

with me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan.
<P>

<P>

We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud
<P>

of dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near,
<P>

we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers. 
<P>

Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by
<P>

the camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawe
<P>

them by informing them who we were, and whither we were going. 
<P>

The robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was none
<P>

of their business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally. 
<P>

I defended myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length,
<P>

seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassador
<P>

and all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse
<P>

and rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead
<P>

from a wound in his side.  I managed to jump off without any injury,
<P>

and looked about to see if I was pursued.  But for the moment I
<P>

was safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in

after my own design.  It is now completed, and ready to be lived in. 
<P>

I should like to show it to you, but you must first swear two things: 
<P>

to be faithful to me, and to keep my secret.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Of course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gave
<P>

the promise without the least hesitation.  He then bade me wait
<P>

an instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richly
<P>

dressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name,
<P>

I thought it was better not to inquire.  We all three sat down to table

<P>

and amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things,
<P>

and with drinking<A NAME = "AS17797"></A> each other's health<A NAME = "AB177914"></A><A HREF = "SPP208.HTM#BB62676"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Suddenly the prince said to me,

<P>

&quot;Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this lady

<P>

to a certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built. 
<P>

You cannot mistake it.  Go in, both of you, and wait till I come. 
<P>

I shall not be long.&quot;
<P>

<P>

As I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my hand
<P>

to the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the place
<P>

of which the prince had spoken.  We had barely reached it when he
<P>

joined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe,
<P>

and a little bag containing plaster.
<P>

<P>

With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre
<P>

in the middle of the tomb.  One by one he took the stones and piled
<P>

them up in a corner.  When he had knocked down the whole sepulchre
<P>

he proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchre
<P>

had been I saw a trap-door. He raised the door and I caught sight
<P>

of the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the lady,
<P>

&quot;Madam, this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which I

<P>

told you of.&quot;
<P>

The two<A NAME = "AO112505"></A> princes returned home, but their adventure made so little
<P>

impression on them that they quite forgot to speak to their sister
<P>

on the subject.  The next morning when they went to hunt they met
<P>

the Sultan in the same place, and he inquired what advice their
<P>

sister had given.  The young men looked at each other and blushed. 
<P>

At last Prince Bahman said, &quot;Sire, we must throw ourselves on your

<P>

Highness's mercy.  Neither my brother nor myself remembered anything
<P>

about it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Then be sure you do not forget to-day,&quot; answered the Sultan,

<P>

&quot;and bring me back your reply to-morrow.&quot;
<P>

<P>

When, however, the same<A NAME = "AO112629"></A> thing happened a second time, they feared
<P>

that the Sultan<A NAME = "AO112637"></A> might be angry with them for their carelessness. 
<P>

But he took it in good part, and, drawing three little golden
<P>

balls from his purse, he held them out to Prince Bahman, saying,
<P>

&quot;Put these in your bosom and you will not forget a third time,
<P>

for when you remove your girdle to-night the noise they will make
<P>

in falling will remind you of my wishes.&quot;
<P>

<P>

It all happened as the Sultan had foreseen, and the two brothers
<P>

appeared in their sister's apartments just as she was in the act
<P>

of stepping into bed, and told their tale.
<P>

<P>

The Princess<A NAME = "AO112745"></A><A NAME = "AS112746"></A><A NAME = "BB112747"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF111355"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Parizade was much disturbed at the news, and did not
<P>

conceal her feelings.  &quot;Your meeting<A NAME = "AO1127512"></A><A NAME = "AS1127513"></A> with the Sultan is very honourable<A NAME = "AB1127526"></A>

<P>

to you,&quot; she said, &quot;and will, I dare say, be of service to you,

<P>

but it places me in a very awkward position.  It is on my account,
<P>

I know, that you have resisted the Sultan's wishes, and I am
<P>

escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I
<P>

took the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales. 
<P>

Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive,
<P>

the inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel
<P>

of food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of hunger. 
<P>

Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep,
<P>

and when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day;
<P>

a beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was tied
<P>

to the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black men. 
<P>

I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I could
<P>

not understand a word of their language.  Feeling perfectly bewildered
<P>

by my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to myself in Arabic,
<P>

&quot;Close<A NAME = "AO43914"></A><A NAME = "AS43915"></A><A NAME = "AS43916"></A> thine<A NAME = "AB43919"></A> eyes, and while thou<A NAME = "AB439118"></A> sleepest Heaven will change thy
<P>

fortune from evil to good.&quot;
<P>

<P>

One of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came forward saying:

<P>

<P>

&quot;My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we

<P>

came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating
<P>

down it, and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore. 
<P>

We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you come
<P>

and where you were going by that dangerous way?&quot;
<P>

<P>

I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them,
<P>

but that I was starving, and would fain<A NAME = "AO440317"></A><A NAME = "AS440318"></A><A NAME = "AB440319"></A> eat something first. 
<P>

I was soon supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied
<P>

my hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me. 
<P>

They were lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them,
<P>

and said that adventures so surprising must be related to their king
<P>

only by the man to whom they had happened.  So, procuring a horse,

met in the middle of the forest.  Here Marzavan begged the prince
<P>

to wait for him, and leading the groom's horse into a dense part
<P>

of the wood he cut its throat, dipped the prince's coat in its blood,
<P>

and having rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground where
<P>

the roads parted.
<P>

<P>

In answer to Camaralzaman's inquiries as to the reason for this,
<P>

Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their journey

<P>

was to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince's death. 
<P>

&quot;Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief,&quot;

<P>

he went on, &quot;but his joy at your return will be all the greater.&quot;

<P>

<P>

The prince<A NAME = "AO63115"></A> and his companion now continued their journey by land
<P>

and sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray their
<P>

expenses they met with no needless delays.  At length they reached
<P>

the capital<A NAME = "AS63145"></A><A NAME = "AB63146"></A><A HREF = "SPP275.HTM#BB825322"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of China, where they spent three days in a suitable
<P>

lodging to recover from their fatigues.
<P>

<P>

During this time<A NAME = "AO63177"></A> Marzavan had an astrologer's dress
<P>

prepared for the prince.  They then went to the baths,
<P>

after which the prince put on the astrologer's robe and was
<P>

conducted within sight of the king's palace by Marzavan,
<P>

who left him there and went to consult his mother, the princess's nurse.

<P>

<P>

Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan's instructions,
<P>

advanced<A NAME = "AO63243"></A><A NAME = "AS63244"></A> close to the palace<A NAME = "AB632413"></A> gates and there proclaimed aloud:
<P>

<P>

&quot;I am an astrologer and I come to restore health to
<P>

the Princess Badoura, daughter of the high and mighty
<P>

King<A NAME = "AS63283"></A><A NAME = "BB63284"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF58125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of China, on the conditions laid down by His

From a rich man I had in one moment become a beggar; and up to this
<P>

time I have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed on me. 
<P>

But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my undoing,
<P>

I oblige each passer-by to give me a blow.
<P>

<P>

This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story.
<P>

<P>

When the blind<A NAME = "AO88697"></A> man had ended the Caliph addressed him: 
<P>

&quot;Baba<A NAME = "AS88704"></A><A NAME = "BB88705"></A><A HREF = "SPP295.HTM#BB887412"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-Abdalla, truly your sin is great, but you have suffered enough. 

<P>

Henceforth repent in private, for I will see that enough money
<P>

is given you day by day for all your wants.&quot;
<P>

<P>

At these words<A NAME = "AO88747"></A><A NAME = "AS88748"></A><A NAME = "AS88749"></A> Baba<A NAME = "BB887412"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF85805"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-Abdalla flung himself at the Caliph's<A NAME = "AB887425"></A> feet,
<P>

and prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for ever.
<P>

<P>

of what had happened, his rage<A NAME = "AO725913"></A><A NAME = "AS725914"></A> and mortification<A NAME = "AB725919"></A> knew no bounds. 
<P>

Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Wretched son! thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father. 
<P>

The king will shed not only thy blood but mine.&quot;  His wife tried
<P>

to console him, saying:  &quot;Do not torment thyself.  With the sale
<P>

of my jewels I will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you
<P>

will buy another slave.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Do not suppose,&quot; replied her husband, &quot;that it is the loss 
of the money
<P>

that affects me.  My honour is at stake, and that is more precious
<P>

to me than all my wealth.  You know that Saouy is my mortal enemy. 
<P>

He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the consequences
<P>

that will ensue.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;My lord,&quot; said his wife, &quot;I am quite aware of Saouy's 
baseness,
<P>

and that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick. 
<P>

But how can he or any one else know what takes place in this house? 
<P>

Even if you are suspected and the king accuses you, you have only
<P>

to say that, after examining the slave, you did not find her worthy
<P>

of his Majesty.  Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers,
<P>

saying that you are not satisfied, and wish them to find you
<P>

another slave.&quot;
<P>

<P>

This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it,
<P>

but his wrath against his son did not abate.  Noureddin dared
<P>

not appear all that day, and fearing to take refuge with his
<P>

usual associates in case his father should seek him there,
<P>

he spent the day in a secluded garden where he was not known. 
<P>

He did not return home till after his father had gone to bed,
<P>

he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would be
<P>

given to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that,
<P>

on the contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished. 
<P>

Meanwhile Noureddin<A NAME = "AO75325"></A><A NAME = "AS75326"></A> and the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad<A NAME = "BB753223"></A><A HREF = "SPP251.HTM#BB753422"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

When the vessel<A NAME = "AO75337"></A> had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces for
<P>

their passage and went ashore.  Never having been in Bagdad<A NAME = "AS753421"></A><A NAME = "BB753422"></A><A HREF = "SPP261.HTM#BB78586"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> before,
<P>

they did not know where to seek a lodging.  Wandering along the banks
<P>

of the Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall. 
<P>

The gate was shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa

<P>

on either side.  &quot;Here,&quot; said Noureddin, &quot;let us pass the 
night,&quot;
<P>

and reclining on the sofas they soon fell asleep.
<P>

<P>

Now this garden<A NAME = "AO75417"></A> belonged to the Caliph.  In the middle of it was
<P>

a vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each window
<P>

having a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there. 
<P>

Only the door-keeper lived there, an old<A NAME = "AO754417"></A><A NAME = "AS754418"></A> soldier named Scheih<A NAME = "AB754425"></A><A HREF = "SPP251.HTM#BB755727"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Ibrahim,
<P>

who had strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted,
<P>

and never to allow any one to sit on the sofas by the door. 
<P>

It happened that evening that he had gone out on an errand. 
<P>

When he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he was
<P>

about to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceived
<P>

that they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman,
<P>

and decided to awake them by gentler means.  Noureddin, on being awoke,

<P>

told the old man that they were strangers, and merely wished to pass
<P>

the night there.  &quot;Come with me,&quot; said Scheih Ibrahim, &quot;I 
will lodge
<P>

you better, and will show you a magnificent garden belonging to me.&quot; 

<P>

So saying<A NAME = "AO75555"></A><A NAME = "AS75556"></A> the doorkeeper led the way into the Caliph's<A NAME = "AB755523"></A> garden,
<P>

the beauties of which filled them with wonder and amazement. 
<P>

Noureddin<A NAME = "AO75573"></A><A NAME = "AS75574"></A><A NAME = "AS75575"></A> took out two gold<A NAME = "BB755714"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF526723"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pieces, and giving them to Scheih<A NAME = "BB755727"></A><A HREF = "SPP252.HTM#BB75735"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Ibrahim

in three days' time.  The ship is to set sail, and I have arranged
<P>

all about your passage with the captain
<P>

<P>

&quot;You could not bring me better news,&quot; replied Camaralzaman,
<P>

&quot;and in return I have something pleasant to tell you.  Follow me
<P>

and see the good fortune which has befallen you.&quot;
<P>

<P>

He then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him the
<P>

treasure stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven
<P>

should in this way reward his kind host's many virtues and compensate
<P>

him for the privations of many years.
<P>

<P>

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the gardener.  &quot;Do you imagine that
I should
<P>

appropriate this treasure?  It is yours, and I have no right whatever
<P>

to it.  For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground here without

<P>

discovering anything.  It is clear that these riches are intended
<P>

for you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself
<P>

than by an old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing. 
<P>

This treasure comes just at the right time, when you are about
<P>

to return to your own country, where you will make good use of it.&quot;

<P>

<P>

But the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finally
<P>

after much discussion they agreed to divide the gold.  When this
<P>

was done the gardener said:
<P>

<P>

&quot;My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry
<P>

off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it. 
<P>

There are no<A NAME = "AO67767"></A><A NAME = "AS67768"></A><A NAME = "AS67769"></A> olives<A NAME = "AB677612"></A><A HREF = "SPP225.HTM#BB67785"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in the Ebony<A NAME = "AB677619"></A> Island, and those imported from
<P>

here fetch a high price.  As you know, I have a good stock of the
<P>

olives<A NAME = "AO67783"></A><A NAME = "AS67784"></A><A NAME = "BB67785"></A><A HREF = "SPP226.HTM#BB677933"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> which grew in this garden.  Now you must take fifty jars,

The air with which he said these words could have left no doubt
<P>

on the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms,
<P>

and the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Prince,&quot; returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to 
speak,
<P>

&quot;you have given me the greatest pleasure, and I have followed you
<P>

closely in all your adventures, and though you are positively
<P>

sitting before me, I even trembled at your danger in the upper
<P>

regions of the air!  Let me say what a debt I owe to the chance
<P>

that has led you to my house; you could have entered none which
<P>

would have given you a warmer welcome.  As to your being a slave,
<P>

of course that is merely a joke, and my reception must itself have
<P>

assured you that you are as free here as at your father's court. 
<P>

As to your heart,&quot; continued she in tones of encouragement,
<P>

&quot;I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago, to some

<P>

princess who is well worthy of it, and I could not think of being
<P>

the cause of your unfaithfulness to her.&quot;
<P>

Prince<A NAME = "AO100083"></A> Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no lady
<P>

with any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entrance
<P>

of one of the princess's attendants, who announced that dinner
<P>

was served, and, after all, neither was sorry for the interruption.
<P>

<P>

Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and the table was
<P>

covered with delicious fruits; while during the repast richly
<P>

dressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments. 
<P>

After the prince and princess had finished, they passed into a small
<P>

room<A NAME = "AO100173"></A> hung with blue and gold, looking out into a garden stocked
<P>

with flowers<A NAME = "AS100185"></A> and arbutus<A NAME = "AB1001810"></A> trees, quite different from any that were

<P>

The chief policeman of the quarter came running up, and found
<P>

a Christian ill-treating a Mussulman.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
<P>

he asked indignantly.
<P>

<P>

&quot;He tried to rob me,&quot; replied the merchant, &quot;and very nearly

<P>

choked me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Well, you have had your revenge,&quot; said the man, catching hold

<P>

of his arm.  &quot;Come, be off with you!&quot;
<P>

<P>

As he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him up,
<P>

but the hunchback<A NAME = "AO48727"></A><A NAME = "AS48728"></A><A NAME = "BB48729"></A><A HREF = "SPP162.HTM#BB488319"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> never moved.  &quot;Oho!&quot; he went on, looking closer,

<P>

&quot;so this is the way<A NAME = "AO487312"></A><A NAME = "AS487313"></A> a Christian has the impudence<A NAME = "AB487324"></A> to treat
<P>

a Mussulman!&quot; and seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he took
<P>

him to the inspector of police, who threw him into prison till
<P>

the judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his case. 
<P>

All this brought the merchant to his senses, but the more he thought
<P>

of it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have died
<P>

merely from the blows he had received.
<P>

<P>

The merchant was still pondering on this subject when he was
<P>

summoned before the chief of police and questioned about his crime,
<P>

which he could not deny.  As the hunchback<A NAME = "AO488317"></A><A NAME = "AS488318"></A><A NAME = "BB488319"></A><A HREF = "SPP185.HTM#BB556913"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> was one of the Sultan's
<P>

private jesters, the chief<A NAME = "AO48849"></A> of police resolved to defer sentence
<P>

of death until he had consulted his master.  He went to the palace
<P>

to demand<A NAME = "AO48865"></A> an audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only answered,

<P>

<P>

&quot;There is no<A NAME = "AO48888"></A> pardon for a Christian who kills a Mussulman.

I pursued it as fast as I could, and found myself in a narrow crack
<P>

among the rocks, along which I was just able to force my way. 
<P>

I followed it for what seemed to me many miles, and at last saw
<P>

before me a glimmer<A NAME = "AO40829"></A> of light which grew clearer every moment until
<P>

I emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot describe. 
<P>

When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it was
<P>

doubtless some little<A NAME = "AO40857"></A> animal which had found its way into the cavern
<P>

from the sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of escape

<P>

which I could never have discovered for myself.  I hastily surveyed
<P>

my surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit from
<P>

the town.
<P>

<P>

The mountains<A NAME = "AO40915"></A> sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no road
<P>

across them.  Being assured of this I returned to the cavern,
<P>

and amassed<A NAME = "AO40935"></A><A NAME = "AS40936"></A><A NAME = "AS40937"></A><A NAME = "AS40938"></A> a rich treasure of diamonds<A NAME = "BB409319"></A><A HREF = "SPP144.HTM#BB434322"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, rubies<A NAME = "AB409322"></A><A HREF = "SPP144.HTM#BB434327"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, emeralds<A NAME = "AB409325"></A>, and jewels
<P>

of all kinds which strewed the ground.  These I made up into bales,
<P>

and stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waited
<P>

hopefully for the passing of a ship.  I had looked out for two days,
<P>

however, before a single sail appeared, so it was with much
<P>

delight that I at last saw a vessel not very far from the shore,
<P>

and by waving my arms and uttering loud cries succeeded in attracting
<P>

the attention of her crew.  A boat was sent off to me, and in answer
<P>

to the questions of the sailors as to how I came to be in such
<P>

a plight, I replied that I had been shipwrecked two days before,
<P>

but had managed to scramble ashore with the bales which I pointed
<P>

out to them.  Luckily for me they believed my story, and without
<P>

even looking at the place where they found me, took up my bundles,
<P>

and rowed me back to the ship.  Once on board, I soon saw that the
<P>

captain<A NAME = "AO41073"></A><A NAME = "AS41074"></A> was too much occupied with the difficulties of navigation<A NAME = "AB410723"></A>
<P>

to pay much heed to me, though he generously made me welcome,

and admiring the device by which I had escaped from the valley,
<P>

and when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds,
<P>

they assured me that in all the years that they had carried on their
<P>

trade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for size
<P>

and beauty.
<P>

<P>

I found that each merchant chose a particular nest, and took his
<P>

chance of what he might find in it.  So I begged the one who owned
<P>

the nest to which I had been carried to take as much as he would
<P>

of my treasure, but he contented himself with one stone, and that by
<P>

no means the largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortune
<P>

was made, and he need toil no more.  I stayed with the merchants
<P>

several days, and then as they were journeying homewards I gladly
<P>

accompanied them.  Our way lay across high mountains infested
<P>

with frightful serpents, but we had the good luck to escape them
<P>

and came at last to the seashore.  Thence we sailed to the isle
<P>

of Rohat<A NAME = "AO35975"></A><A NAME = "AS35976"></A> where the camphor<A NAME = "AB359713"></A> trees grow to such a size that a hundred
<P>

men could shelter under one of them with ease.  The sap flows

&quot;My dear sister,&quot; answered the prince, &quot;accidents only happen

<P>

to unlucky people, and I hope that I am not one of them. 
<P>

But as everything is uncertain, I promise you to be very careful. 
<P>

Take this knife,&quot; he continued, handing her one that hung sheathed

<P>

from his belt, &quot;and every now and then draw it out and look at it. 

<P>

As long as it keeps bright and clean as it is to-day, you will know
<P>

that I am living; but if the blade is spotted with blood, it will be
<P>

a sign that I am dead, and you shall weep for me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So saying, Prince<A NAME = "AO108397"></A> Bahman bade them farewell once more, and started
<P>

on the high road, well mounted and fully armed.  For twenty days he
<P>

rode straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left,
<P>

till he found<A NAME = "AS108427"></A> himself drawing near the frontiers of Persia<A NAME = "BB1084222"></A><A HREF = "SPP384.HTM#BB1153010"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

Seated under a tree by the wayside he noticed a hideous old man,
<P>

with a long<A NAME = "AO108447"></A><A NAME = "AS108448"></A> white moustache<A NAME = "AB1084413"></A>, and beard that almost fell to his feet. 
<P>

His nails<A NAME = "AO108455"></A> had grown to an enormous length, and on his head he wore a
<P>

huge hat, which served him for an umbrella.
<P>

<P>

Prince Bahman, who, remembering the directions of the old woman,
<P>

had been since sunrise on the look-out for some one, recognised the
<P>

old man at once to be a dervish.  He dismounted from his horse,
<P>

and bowed low before the holy man, saying by way of greeting,
<P>

&quot;My father, may your days be long in the land, and may all your wishes

<P>

be fulfilled!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The dervish did his best to reply, but his moustache was so thick that
<P>

his words were hardly intelligible, and the prince, perceiving what
<P>

was the matter, took a pair of scissors from his saddle pockets,
<P>

and requested permission to cut off some of the moustache, as he had
<P>

&quot;The women, sire,&quot; said the bird, &quot;were the sisters of the 
Sultana,
<P>

who were devoured with jealousy at the honour you had done her, and in
<P>

order to revenge themselves invented this story.  Have them examined,
<P>

and they will confess their crime.  These are your children,
<P>

who were saved from death by the intendant of your gardens,
<P>

and brought up by him as if they were his own.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Like a flash<A NAME = "AO115267"></A> the truth came to the mind of the Sultan. 
<P>

&quot;Bird,&quot; he cried, &quot;my heart tells me that what you say is 
true. 
<P>

My children,&quot; he added, &quot;let me embrace you, and embrace each 
other,
<P>

not only as brothers and sister, but as having in you the blood
<P>

royal<A NAME = "AO115303"></A><A NAME = "AS115304"></A><A NAME = "AS115305"></A> of Persia<A NAME = "BB1153010"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF420"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> which could flow in no nobler<A NAME = "AB1153023"></A> veins.&quot;
<P>

<P>

When the first moments of emotion were over, the Sultan hastened
<P>

to finish his repast, and then turning to his children he exclaimed: 
<P>

&quot;To-day you have made acquaintance with your father.  To-morrow I
<P>

will bring you the Sultana your mother.  Be ready to receive her.&quot;

<P>

<P>

The Sultan then mounted his horse and rode quickly back to the capital. 

<P>

Without an instant's delay he sent for the grand-vizir, and ordered
<P>

him to seize and question the Sultana's sisters that very day. 
<P>

This was done.  They were confronted with each other and proved guilty,

<P>

and were executed in less than an hour.
<P>

<P>

But the Sultan<A NAME = "AO115437"></A> did not wait to hear that his orders had been
<P>

carried out before going on foot, followed by his whole court to
<P>

the door of the great mosque, and drawing the Sultana with his own
<P>

hand out of the narrow prison where she had spent so many years,
<P>

&quot;Madam,&quot; he cried, embracing her with tears in his eyes,
<P>

&quot;I have come to ask your pardon for the injustice I have done you,

<P>

&quot;Baba<A NAME = "AS85824"></A><A NAME = "BB85825"></A><A HREF = "SPP295.HTM#BB88705"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-Abdalla,&quot; returned the Caliph, &quot;your way of asking alms

<P>

yesterday seemed to me so strange, that I almost commanded you
<P>

then and there to cease from causing such a public scandal. 
<P>

But I have sent for you to inquire what was your motive in making
<P>

such a curious vow.  When I know the reason I shall be able to judge
<P>

whether you can be permitted to continue to practise it, for I
<P>

cannot help thinking that it sets a very bad example to others. 
<P>

Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal nothing.&quot;
<P>

<P>

These words<A NAME = "AS85915"></A> troubled the heart<A NAME = "AB859112"></A> of Baba-Abdalla, who prostrated
<P>

himself at the feet of the Caliph.  Then rising, he answered: 
<P>

&quot;Commander of the Faithful, I crave your pardon humbly,
<P>

for my persistence in beseeching your Highness to do an action
<P>

which appears on the face of it to be without any meaning. 
<P>

No doubt, in the eyes of men, it has none; but I look on it as a
<P>

slight expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been guilty,
<P>

and if your Highness<A NAME = "AO85989"></A> will deign to listen to my tale, you will
<P>

see that no punishment could atone for the crime.&quot;

once more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for I
<P>

felt that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation. 
<P>

At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down upon a rock, but I had
<P>

hardly closed my eyes when I was startled by something which fell
<P>

to the ground with a thud close beside me.
<P>

<P>

It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it several
<P>

more<A NAME = "AO35463"></A> pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places.  I had
<P>

always thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous
<P>

valley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had
<P>

devised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers'
<P>

tales<A NAME = "AO35503"></A><A NAME = "AS35504"></A><A NAME = "AS35505"></A><A NAME = "BB35506"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF82427"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> invented to give pleasure to the hearers<A NAME = "AB355021"></A><A HREF = "SPP137.HTM#BB411819"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, but now I perceived
<P>

that they were surely true.  These merchants came to the valley
<P>

at the time<A NAME = "AS35527"></A> when the eagles<A NAME = "AB355214"></A><A HREF = "SPP118.HTM#BB355613"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, which keep their eyries in the rocks,
<P>

had hatched their young.  The merchants then threw great lumps
<P>

of meat into the valley.  These, falling with so much force upon
<P>

the diamonds, were sure to take up some of the precious stones
<P>

with them, when the eagles<A NAME = "AO355611"></A><A NAME = "AS355612"></A><A NAME = "BB355613"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF355214"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pounced upon the meat and carried it off
<P>

to their nests to feed their hungry broods.  Then the merchants,
<P>

scaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries, would secure
<P>

their treasures.  Until this moment I had looked upon the valley
<P>

as my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting out of it alive,
<P>

but now I took courage and began to devise a means of escape. 
<P>

I began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find and storing

<P>

them carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions;
<P>

this I tied securely to my belt.  I then chose the piece of meat
<P>

which seemed most suited to my purpose, and with the aid of my turban
<P>

bound it firmly to my back; this done I laid down upon my face
<P>

and awaited the coming of the eagles.  I soon heard the flapping
<P>

of their mighty wings above me, and had the satisfaction of feeling

in with pirates, who seized our vessel, killing all who resisted,
<P>

and making prisoners of those who were prudent enough to submit at once,

<P>

of whom I was one.  When they had despoiled us of all we possessed,
<P>

they forced us to put on vile raiment, and sailing to a distant island
<P>

there sold us for slaves.  I fell into the hands of a rich merchant,
<P>

who took me home with him, and clothed and fed me well, and after
<P>

some days sent for me and questioned me as to what I could do.
<P>

<P>

I answered that I was a rich merchant who had been captured by pirates,

<P>

and therefore I knew no trade.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Tell me,&quot; said he, &quot;can you shoot with a bow?&quot;
<P>

<P>

I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth,
<P>

and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me.
<P>

<P>

Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with
<P>

him upon his own<A NAME = "AO46069"></A><A NAME = "AS460610"></A> elephant<A NAME = "BB460613"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF36049"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> took the way to a vast forest which lay far
<P>

from the town.  When we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped,
<P>

and my master said to me:  &quot;This forest swarms with elephants. 
<P>

Hide yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that pass you. 
<P>

When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So saying he gave me a supply<A NAME = "AO461215"></A> of food, and returned to the town,
<P>

and I perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch.  That night
<P>

I saw nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a large
<P>

herd<A NAME = "AO46153"></A><A NAME = "AS46154"></A> of elephants<A NAME = "AB46159"></A> came crashing and trampling by.  I lost no time
<P>

in letting fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals
<P>

fell to the ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free
<P>

to come down from my hiding place and run back to tell my master

&quot;He carries it about with him,&quot; said the princess, &quot;I know,

my faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded

<P>

powder returned to the princess, who let him in by a little side door.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Put on your most beautiful dress,&quot; he said to her, &quot;and 
receive
<P>

the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you

have forgotten me.  Invite him to sup with you, and say you
<P>

wish to taste the wine of his country.  He will go for some,
<P>

and while he is gone I will tell you what to do.&quot;

herself gaily for the first<A NAME = "AS838911"></A> time since she left China<A NAME = "BB838922"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB841412"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  She put
<P>

on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in a glass
<P>

that she looked more beautiful than ever, received the magician,
<P>

saying to his great amazement:  &quot;I have made up my mind that Aladdin<A NAME = "AS839228"></A><A NAME = "BB839229"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB83994"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>

<P>

is dead, and that all my tears will not bring him back to me,
<P>

so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited you
<P>

to sup with me; but I am tired<A NAME = "AS839517"></A> of the wines<A NAME = "AB839524"></A> of China, and would

But rescued though she was from one peril, it seemed as if she
<P>

had only fallen into another.  The Sultan commanded a horse to
<P>

be given her, and conducted her to his own palace, where he led
<P>

her to a beautiful apartment, and selected female slaves to wait
<P>

on her, and eunuchs to be her guard.  Then, without allowing
<P>

her time to thank him for all he had done, he bade her repose,
<P>

saying she should tell him her adventures on the following day.
<P>

<P>

The princess fell asleep, flattering herself that she had only
<P>

to relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by compassion,
<P>

and to restore her to the prince without delay.  But a few hours
<P>

were to undeceive her.
<P>

<P>

When the King<A NAME = "AO102737"></A><A NAME = "AS102738"></A><A NAME = "AB102739"></A> of Cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before,
<P>

he had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princess
<P>

becoming his wife, and at daybreak proclamation of his intention was
<P>

made throughout the town, by the sound of drums, trumpets, cymbals,
<P>

and other<A NAME = "AO102775"></A> instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy. 
<P>

The Princess<A NAME = "AO102785"></A><A NAME = "AS102786"></A><A NAME = "BB102787"></A><A HREF = "SPP346.HTM#BB1038119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Bengal was early awakened by the noise, but she did
<P>

not for one moment imagine that it had anything to do with her,
<P>

till the Sultan, arriving as soon as she was dressed to inquire
<P>

after her health<A NAME = "AO102817"></A><A NAME = "AS102818"></A><A NAME = "BB102819"></A><A HREF = "SPP343.HTM#BB103107"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, informed her that the trumpet blasts she heard
<P>

were part of the solemn marriage ceremonies, for which he begged
<P>

her to prepare.  This unexpected announcement caused the princess
<P>

such terror that she sank down in a dead faint.
<P>

<P>

The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid, and the Sultan
<P>

himself did his best to bring her back to consciousness, but for
<P>

a long while it was all to no purpose.  At length her senses

send for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to amuse
<P>

my guests.  In spite of my riches I shall not, however, give up trade
<P>

till I have amassed a capital of a hundred thousand drachmas, when,
<P>

having become a man of much consideration, I shall request the hand
<P>

of the grand-vizir's daughter, taking care to inform the worthy
<P>

father that I have heard favourable reports of her beauty and wit,
<P>

and that I will pay down on our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces. 
<P>

Should the vizir refuse my proposal, which after all is hardly to
<P>

be expected, I will seize him by the beard and drag him to my house.&quot;

<P>

<P>

When I shall have married his daughter I will give her ten of the best
<P>

<P>

gorgeous<A NAME = "AO50813"></A><A NAME = "AS50814"></A><A NAME = "AB50815"></A> robes, and mounted on a horse with a saddle of fine gold,
<P>

and its trappings<A NAME = "AO50827"></A><A NAME = "AS50828"></A> blazing with diamonds<A NAME = "BB508215"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF120226"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, followed by a train
<P>

of slaves, I shall present myself at the house of the grand-vizir,
<P>

the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as I pass along. 
<P>

At the foot of the grand-vizir's staircase I shall dismount,
<P>

and while my servants stand in a row to right and left I shall
<P>

ascend the stairs, at the head of which the grand-vizir will be
<P>

waiting to receive me.  He will then embrace me as his son-in-law,
<P>

and giving me his seat will place himself below me.  This being done
<P>

(as I have every reason to expect), two of my servants will enter,
<P>

each bearing a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold. 
<P>

One of these I shall present to him saying, &quot;Here are the thousand

<P>

gold pieces that I offered for your daughter's hand, and here,&quot;
<P>

I shall continue, holding out the second purse, &quot;are another
<P>

thousand to show you that I am a man who is better than his word.&quot; 

<P>

After hearing of such generosity the world will talk of nothing else.
<P>

<P>

I shall return home with the same pomp as I set out, and my wife

a napkin<A NAME = "AO80395"></A><A NAME = "AS80396"></A><A NAME = "AS80397"></A> and laid in it the magic<A NAME = "AB803920"></A> fruits from the enchanted<A NAME = "AB803929"></A> garden,
<P>

which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels.  She took
<P>

these with her to please the Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp. 

<P>

The grand<A NAME = "AO80425"></A><A NAME = "AS80426"></A>-vizir and the lords<A NAME = "AB804215"></A> of council had just gone in as she
<P>

entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan. 
<P>

He, however, took no notice of her.  She went every day for a week,
<P>

and stood in the same place.
<P>

<P>

When the council<A NAME = "AO80477"></A> broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said
<P>

to his vizir:  &quot;I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber
<P>

every day carrying something in a napkin.  Call her next time,
<P>

that I may find out what she wants.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot of
<P>

the throne<A NAME = "AO80535"></A>, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: 
<P>

&quot;Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want.&quot;
<P>

<P>

She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir, and bade
<P>

her speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she
<P>

might say.  She then told him of her son's violent love for the princess.

<P>

<P>

&quot;I prayed him to forget her,&quot; she said, &quot;but in vain; he 
threatened
<P>

to do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty
<P>

for the hand of the princess.  Now I pray you to forgive not me alone,
<P>

but my son<A NAME = "AS80637"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB806310"></A><A HREF = "SPP269.HTM#BB80785"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she
<P>

unfolded the jewels and presented them.
<P>

<P>

He was thunderstruck<A NAME = "AO80687"></A><A NAME = "AS80688"></A><A NAME = "AS80689"></A><A NAME = "AB806810"></A>, and turning to the vizir<A NAME = "BB806821"></A><A HREF = "SPP269.HTM#BB80727"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> said:  &quot;What sayest thou

and here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Whereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go,
<P>

not seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me that
<P>

they had retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open
<P>

to the Ivory<A NAME = "AO46547"></A><A NAME = "AS46548"></A><A NAME = "AB46549"></A> Hill, and I did not know how sufficiently to admire
<P>

their sagacity.  After a day and a night I reached my master's house,
<P>

and was received by him with joyful surprise.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Ah! poor<A NAME = "AS46587"></A> Sindbad<A NAME = "BB465810"></A><A HREF = "SPP157.HTM#BB47157"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,&quot; he cried, &quot;I was wondering what could 
have become
<P>

of you.  When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted,
<P>

and the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should never see
<P>

you again.  Pray tell me how you escaped death.&quot;
<P>

<P>

I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together
<P>

to the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had told him
<P>

nothing but the truth.  When we had loaded our elephant with as
<P>

many tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city,
<P>

he said:
<P>

<P>

&quot;My brother--since I can no longer treat as a slave one who has
<P>

enriched me thus--take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you. 
<P>

I will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have
<P>

killed numbers of our slaves every year.  No matter what good advice
<P>

we gave them, they were caught sooner or later.  You alone have
<P>

escaped the wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the
<P>

special protection of Heaven.  Now through you the whole town will
<P>

be enriched without further loss of life, therefore you shall not
<P>

only receive your liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon you.&quot;

&quot;l assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even

<P>

the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas. 
<P>

Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven voyages,

<P>

and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and land,
<P>

I will now give you a full and true account of them, which I think
<P>

you will be well pleased to hear.&quot;

<P>

the porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burden
<P>

which had been left in the street should be carried by some of his
<P>

own servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first,

<P>

<P>

I had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being
<P>

young and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every
<P>

kind of pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take
<P>

to themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine,
<P>

and remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed,
<P>

I began to bethink me of how I could make the best of what still
<P>

remained to me.  I sold all my household goods by public auction,
<P>

and joined a company of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with
<P>

them at Balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us.

of the sea<A NAME = "AO43197"></A>, and our vessel was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at
<P>

its base, not, however, until we had managed to scramble on shore,
<P>

carrying with us the most precious of our possessions.  When we
<P>

had done this the captain said to us:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once,
<P>

since from this fatal<A NAME = "AO43259"></A> spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned.&quot;

<P>

<P>

This speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over our
<P>

sad fate.
<P>

<P>

The mountain<A NAME = "AO43305"></A> formed the seaward boundary of a large island,
<P>

and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn
<P>

with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones
<P>

of the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we
<P>

shuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap. 
<P>

All around, too, lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise,
<P>

and treasures were heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but all
<P>

these things only added to the desolation of the scene.  It struck
<P>

me as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water,
<P>

which gushed out from the mountain not far from where we stood,
<P>

instead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do,
<P>

turned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a natural archway
<P>

of rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I found that
<P>

inside the cave<A NAME = "AO43437"></A><A NAME = "AS43438"></A><A NAME = "AS43439"></A> the walls were thick with diamonds<A NAME = "BB434322"></A><A HREF = "SPP148.HTM#BB44515"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and rubies<A NAME = "BB434327"></A><A HREF = "SPP148.HTM#BB44485"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

and masses<A NAME = "AO43445"></A><A NAME = "AS43446"></A> of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris<A NAME = "AB434425"></A>. 
<P>

Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to
<P>

our fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain,
<P>

and if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom. 
<P>

The first thing our captain did was to divide equally amongst us

<P>

<P>

That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she
<P>

had been carried<A NAME = "AS83527"></A> into Africa<A NAME = "BB835212"></A><A HREF = "SPP279.HTM#BB839612"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> by the magician, whose company she was
<P>

forced to endure once a day.  She, however, treated him so harshly
<P>

that he dared not live there altogether.  As she was dressing,
<P>

one of her women<A NAME = "AS83559"></A> looked out and saw Aladdin<A NAME = "BB835520"></A><A HREF = "SPP278.HTM#BB835624"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The princess ran
<P>

and opened the window, and at the noise she made<A NAME = "AS835621"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB835624"></A><A HREF = "SPP278.HTM#BB836014"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> looked up. 
<P>

She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of these
<P>

lovers at seeing each other again.
<P>

<P>

After he had kissed her Aladdin<A NAME = "AS836013"></A><A NAME = "BB836014"></A><A HREF = "SPP278.HTM#BB836815"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> said:  &quot;I beg of you, Princess,
<P>

in God's name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sake
<P>

and mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the
<P>

cornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting.&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;Alas!&quot; she said &quot;I am the innocent<A NAME = "AO836519"></A><A NAME = "AS836520"></A><A NAME = "AB836521"></A> cause of our sorrows,
&quot; and told
<P>

him of the exchange of the lamp.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Now I know,&quot; cried<A NAME = "AS836812"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB836815"></A><A HREF = "SPP279.HTM#BB83784"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &quot;that we have to thank the

to do.
<P>

<P>

&quot;After having conferred such benefits on you,&quot; said he, &quot;I am

<P>

loth indeed to work you such evil.  Think what it is to be blind,
<P>

and do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you live.&quot;

<P>

<P>

It was of no use.  &quot;My brother,&quot; I said firmly, &quot;pray say no 
more,
<P>

but do what I ask.  You have most generously responded to my wishes
<P>

up to this time, da not spoil my recollection of you for a thing
<P>

of such little consequence.  Let what will happen I take it on my
<P>

own head, and will never reproach you.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Since you are determined upon it,&quot; he answered with a sigh,
<P>

&quot;there is no use talking,&quot; and taking the ointment he laid some

<P>

on my right eye, which was tight shut.  When I tried to open it
<P>

heavy clouds of darkness floated before me.  I was as blind as you
<P>

see me now!
<P>

<P>

&quot;Miserable dervish!&quot;  I shrieked, &quot;so it is true after all! 

<P>

Into what a bottomless<A NAME = "AO88389"></A> pit has my lust after gold plunged me. 
<P>

Ah, now that my eyes are closed they are really opened.  I know that
<P>

all my sufferings are caused by myself alone!  But, good brother,
<P>

you, who are so kind and charitable, and know the secrets of such
<P>

vast learning, have you nothing that will give me back my sight?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Unhappy man,&quot; replied the dervish, &quot;it is not my fault that 
this has
<P>

befallen you, but it is a just chastisement.  The blindness of your
<P>

heart<A NAME = "AO88463"></A><A NAME = "AS88464"></A> has wrought the blindness<A NAME = "AB884613"></A> of your body.  Yes, I have secrets;
<P>

that you have seen in the short time that we have known each other. 
<P>

But I have none that will give you back your sight.  You have proved

the Singing<A NAME = "AO109795"></A><A NAME = "AS109796"></A><A NAME = "AS109797"></A><A NAME = "BB109798"></A><A HREF = "SPP367.HTM#BB110228"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Tree and the Golden<A NAME = "AB1097917"></A><A HREF = "SPP367.HTM#BB1102217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Water were to be found.  As in the case

<P>

of his brother, the dervish tried to make him give up his project,
<P>

and even told him that only a few weeks since a young man,
<P>

bearing a strong resemblance to himself, had passed that way,
<P>

but had never come back again.
<P>

<P>

&quot;That, holy dervish,&quot; replied Prince Perviz, &quot;was my elder 
brother,
<P>

who is now dead, though how he died I cannot say.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;He is changed into a black stone,&quot; answered the dervish, &quot;
like all
<P>

the rest who have gone on the same errand, and you will become one
<P>

likewise if you are not more careful in following my directions.&quot; 

<P>

Then he charged the prince, as he valued his life, to take no heed
<P>

of the clamour<A NAME = "AO109927"></A><A NAME = "AS109928"></A><A NAME = "AB109929"></A> of voices that would pursue him up the mountain,
<P>

and handing him a ball from the bag, which still seemed to be half full,

<P>

he sent him on his way.
<P>

<P>

When Prince<A NAME = "AO109965"></A> Perviz reached the foot of the mountain he jumped from
<P>

his horse, and paused for a moment to recall the instructions the
<P>

dervish had given him.  Then he strode boldly on, but had scarcely
<P>

gone five or six paces when he was startled by a man's voice
<P>

that seemed close to his ear, exclaiming:  &quot;Stop, rash fellow,
<P>

and let me punish your audacity.&quot;  This outrage entirely put
<P>

the dervish's advice out of the prince's head.  He drew his sword,
<P>

and turned to avenge himself, but almost before he had realised
<P>

that there was nobody there, he and his horse were two black stones.
<P>

<P>

Not a morning had passed since Prince Perviz had ridden away without
<P>

Princess Parizade telling her beads, and at night she even hung
<P>

them round her neck, so that if she woke she could assure herself

within a few days of each other.  I had inherited from them
<P>

a small fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase,
<P>

till at last I found myself the owner of eighty camels.  These I
<P>

hired out to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompanied
<P>

on their various journeys, and always returned with large profits.
<P>

<P>

One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supply
<P>

of goods<A NAME = "AO86165"></A><A NAME = "AS86166"></A>, intended for India<A NAME = "BB861613"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB935622"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and halted at noon in a lonely place,
<P>

which promised rich pasture for my camels.  I was resting in the
<P>

shade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora,
<P>

sat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what
<P>

place he was going.  We soon made friends, and after we had asked
<P>

each other the usual questions, we produced the food we had with us,
<P>

and satisfied our hunger.
<P>

<P>

While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a spot
<P>

only a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hidden
<P>

a treasure so great that if my eighty<A NAME = "AO862617"></A><A NAME = "AS862618"></A> camels<A NAME = "AB862621"></A><A HREF = "SPP290.HTM#BB870119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> were loaded till they
<P>

could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if it
<P>

had never been touched.
<P>

<P>

At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and I
<P>

flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:  &quot;Good 
dervish,
<P>

I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you,
<P>

therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you? 
<P>

Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful.  But tell me
<P>

where it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give you
<P>

one of them as a token of my gratitude.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it was

<P>

that when he was grown up, a more charming and accomplished young man
<P>

was not to be found.  Whilst he was still a youth the king, his father,

<P>

who loved him dearly, had some thoughts of abdicating in his favour. 
<P>

As usual he talked over his plans with his grand-vizir, who,
<P>

though he did not approve the idea, would not state all his objections.

<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; he replied, &quot;the prince is still very young for the 
cares
<P>

of state.  Your Majesty<A NAME = "AO56279"></A> fears his growing idle and careless,
<P>

and doubtless you are right.  But how would it be if he were first
<P>

to marry?  This would attach him to his home, and your Majesty
<P>

might give him a share in your counsels, so that he might gradually
<P>

learn how to wear a crown, which you can give up to him whenever
<P>

you find him capable of wearing it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The vizir's advice once more struck the king as being good,
<P>

and he sent for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons,
<P>

and standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked
<P>

for his commands.

Knowing this custom, Ali<A NAME = "AO95099"></A><A NAME = "AS950910"></A><A NAME = "BB950911"></A><A HREF = "SPP318.HTM#BB95395"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Cogia followed the Caliph into the public
<P>

hall<A NAME = "AO95103"></A><A NAME = "AS95104"></A><A NAME = "AB95105"></A> of the palace, and waited the result.  After some time the
<P>

officer appeared, and told him that the Caliph<A NAME = "AO951117"></A> had read his petition,
<P>

and had appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience. 
<P>

He then inquired the merchant's address, so that he might be summoned
<P>

to attend also.
<P>

<P>

That very evening, the Caliph, with his grand-vizir Giafar, and Mesrour,

<P>

chief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as was their habit,
<P>

went out to take a stroll through the town.
<P>

<P>

Going down one street, the Caliph's attention was attracted
<P>

by a noise, and looking through a door which opened into a court
<P>

he perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight. 
<P>

He hid himself in a dark corner, and watched them.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Let us play at being the Cadi,&quot; said the brightest and quickest

<P>

of them all; &quot;I will be the Cadi.  Bring before me Ali Cogia,
<P>

and the merchant<A NAME = "AO95277"></A> who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The boy's<A NAME = "AO95295"></A> words recalled to the Caliph the petition he had read
<P>

that morning, and he waited with interest to see what the children
<P>

would do.
<P>

<P>

The proposal was hailed with joy by the other children, who had heard
<P>

a great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly settled
<P>

the part each one was to play.  The Cadi<A NAME = "AO953519"></A> took his seat gravely,
<P>

and an officer introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff, and then
<P>

the merchant who was the defendant.

and I was beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my
<P>

father<A NAME = "AO99603"></A><A NAME = "AS99604"></A> could not make up his mind to treat the insolent<A NAME = "AB996025"></A> proposal
<P>

as it deserved.  I tried to argue with him, but in vain.  He only
<P>

begged me to examine the horse with a view (as I quite understood)
<P>

of making me more sensible of its value.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;To please my father, I mounted the horse, and, without waiting
<P>

for any instructions<A NAME = "AO99667"></A> from the Indian, turned the peg as I had seen
<P>

him do.  In an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker than
<P>

an arrow could fly, and I felt as if I must be getting so near
<P>

the sky that I should soon hit my head against it!  I could see
<P>

nothing beneath me, and for some time was so confused that I
<P>

did not even know in what direction I was travelling.  At last,
<P>

when it was growing dark, I found another screw, and on turning it,
<P>

the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth.  I was forced
<P>

to trust to chance, and to see what fate had in store, and it was
<P>

already past midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace. 
<P>

I crept down the little staircase, and made directly for a light
<P>

which I perceived through an open door--I peeped cautiously in,
<P>

and saw, as you will guess, the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor. 
<P>

I knew the risks I ran, but my need was so great that I paid no
<P>

attention to them, and stole safely past your guards, to the curtain
<P>

which concealed your doorway.
<P>

<P>

&quot;The rest, Princess, you know; and it only remains for me to thank you

<P>

for the kindness you have shown me, and to assure you of my gratitude. 

<P>

By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I have only
<P>

my heart, that is my own, to offer you.  But what am I saying? 
<P>

My own?  Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment I
<P>

beheld you!&quot;

<p><ul>  Part D of title IV (42 U.S.C. 651-669), as amended by section 353 of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following 
new section:</ul>
<p><h3> SEC. 469B. GRANTS TO STATES FOR ACCESS AND VISITATION PROGRAMS.</h3>
<p><ul>   (a) IN GENERAL-- The Administration<A NAME = "AO298014"></A><A NAME = "AS298015"></A><A NAME = "AS298016"></A> for Children and Families shall make grants under this section to enable States to 
establish and administer programs to support and facilitate noncustodial<A NAME = "AB298064"></A> parents' access to and visitation<A NAME = "AB298075"></A> of their children, by means of

Persian Gulf, having the coast<A NAME = "AS329911"></A> of Persia<A NAME = "BB329916"></A><A HREF = "SPP175.HTM#BB527614"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> upon our left hand and upon
<P>

our right<A NAME = "AS33005"></A> the shores of Arabia<A NAME = "AB330014"></A> Felix.  I was at first much troubled
<P>

by the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health,
<P>

and since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness.
<P>

<P>

From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or
<P>

exchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly,

<P>

we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow,

<P>

which only rose slightly above the surface of the water.  Our sails
<P>

were furled<A NAME = "AO33085"></A>, and the captain gave permission to all who wished
<P>

to land for a while and amuse themselves.  I was among the number,
<P>

but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire
<P>

and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us,
<P>

we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island,
<P>

while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry
<P>

bidding us come on board for our lives, since what we had taken
<P>

for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping<A NAME = "AS331523"></A> whale<A NAME = "AB331526"></A><A HREF = "SPP110.HTM#BB331728"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it,
<P>

others sprang into the sea, but before I could save myself the whale<A NAME = "AS331727"></A><A NAME = "BB331728"></A><A HREF = "SPP112.HTM#BB338310"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving me clinging
<P>

to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire. 
<P>

Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that ensued
<P>

on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were
<P>

in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I was
<P>

left at the mercy of the waves.  All that day I floated up and down,
<P>

now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired for
<P>

my life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail support,
<P>

and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had
<P>

drifted against an island.

to the house, but what was his surprise to find the door open,
<P>

and the room with the chests of gold quite empty.  The lady had been
<P>

cleverer than himself, and had made the best use of her time.  However,

<P>

he tried to console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture,
<P>

which more than made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost.
<P>

<P>

Unluckily, on leaving the house, he forgot to lock the door,
<P>

and the neighbours<A NAME = "AO53467"></A><A NAME = "AS53468"></A><A NAME = "AB53469"></A>, finding the place empty, informed the police,
<P>

who next morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief.  My brother tried to bribe

<P>

them to let him off, but far from listening to him they tied his hands,

<P>

and forced him to walk between them to the presence of the judge. 
<P>

When they had explained to the official the cause of complaint,
<P>

he asked Alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that he
<P>

had taken to his house the day before.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sir,&quot; replied Alnaschar, &quot;I am ready to tell you the whole 
story,
<P>

but give, I pray you, your word, that I shall run no risk of punishment.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;That I promise,&quot; said the judge.  So my brother began at the

<P>

beginning and related all his adventures, and how he had avenged
<P>

himself on those who had betrayed him.  As to the furniture,
<P>

he entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep part to make
<P>

up for the five<A NAME = "AO53619"></A> hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from him.
<P>

<P>

The judge, however, would say nothing about this, and lost no time
<P>

then reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good.

<P>

&quot;You are mistaken,&quot; said he, &quot;Ali Cogia declares he put them

&quot;My lord,&quot; returned the olive merchants, &quot;we can assure you 
that

the merchants<A NAME = "AS95915"></A> in Bagdad<A NAME = "BB959110"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF13816"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> you will not find one to give a contrary opinion.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

The accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest, but the
<P>

Cadi gave him no time.  &quot;Be silent,&quot; he said, &quot;you are a 
thief. 
<P>

Take him away and hang him.&quot;  So the game ended, the children
<P>

clapping their hands in applause, and leading the criminal away
<P>

to be hanged.

&quot;I see nothing in it,&quot; replied the king, &quot;except a clever 
imitation
<P>

of a real one; and any skilled workman might do as much.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; returned the Indian, &quot;it is not of his outward form 
that I
<P>

would speak, but of the use that I can make of him.  I have only
<P>

to mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and no
<P>

matter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find
<P>

myself there.  It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous,
<P>

and if your Highness will allow me, you can prove it for yourself.&quot;

<P>

<P>

The King<A NAME = "AS97005"></A><A NAME = "AB97006"></A><A HREF = "SPP328.HTM#BB986625"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the common,

<P>

and had never before come across a horse with such qualities,
<P>

bade<A NAME = "AO97023"></A><A NAME = "AS97024"></A> the Indian<A NAME = "AB97029"></A> mount tho animal, and show what he could do. 
<P>

In an instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired where
<P>

the monarch wished to send him.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Do you see that mountain?&quot; asked the king, pointing to a huge

<P>

mass<A NAME = "AO97073"></A> that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz;
<P>

&quot;go and bring me the leaf<A NAME = "AO970814"></A> of a palm that grows at the foot.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The words were hardly out of the king's mouth when the Indian
<P>

turned a screw placed in the horse's neck, close to the saddle,
<P>

and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon
<P>

beyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes.  In a quarter of an
<P>

hour the Indian was seen returning, bearing in his hand the palm,
<P>

and, guiding his horse to the foot of the throne, he dismounted,
<P>

and laid the leaf before the king.
<P>

<P>

Now the monarch<A NAME = "AO97187"></A> had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the

the Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind
<P>

him a long line of kings.

<P>

<H2>The Adventures<A NAME = "AS84954"></A><A NAME = "AS84955"></A><A NAME = "AB84956"></A> of Haroun-al-Raschid, Caliph<A NAME = "AB849517"></A> of Bagdad</H2>

<P>

<P>

The Caliph<A NAME = "AO84985"></A> Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace, wondering if there was
<P>

anything left in the world that could possibly give him a few hours'
<P>

amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and tried friend,
<P>

suddenly appeared before him.  Bowing low, he waited, as was his duty,
<P>

till his master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid merely turned his
<P>

head and looked at him, and sank back into his former weary posture.
<P>

<P>

Now Giafar<A NAME = "AO85055"></A> had something of importance to say to the Caliph,
<P>

and had no intention of being put off by mere silence, so with
<P>

another low bow in front of the throne, he began to speak.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; said he, &quot;I have taken on myself
to
<P>

remind your Highness that you have undertaken secretly to observe
<P>

for yourself the manner in which justice is done and order is kept
<P>

throughout the city.  This is the day you have set apart to devote
<P>

to this object, and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find
<P>

some distraction from the melancholy to which, as I see to my sorrow,
<P>

you are a prey.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;You are right,&quot; returned the Caliph, &quot;I had forgotten all 
about it. 
<P>

Go and change your coat, and I will change mine.&quot;

who fared no better.  Then he had recourse to the most celebrated
<P>

physicians in the other large towns, but finding that the task
<P>

was beyond their science, he finally sent messengers into the other
<P>

neighbouring states, with a memorandum containing full particulars
<P>

of the princess's madness, offering at the same time to pay
<P>

the expenses of any physician who would come and see for himself,
<P>

and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her.  In answer
<P>

to this proclamation many foreign<A NAME = "AO1032611"></A> professors flocked into Cashmere,
<P>

but they naturally were not more successful than the rest had been,
<P>

as the cure depended neither on them nor their skill, but only on
<P>

the princess herself.
<P>

<P>

It was during this time that Prince Firouz Schah, wandering sadly
<P>

and hopelessly from place to place, arrived<A NAME = "AS1033215"></A> in a large city<A NAME = "AB1033224"></A> of India,
<P>

where he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of Bengal who
<P>

had gone out of her senses, on the very day that she was to have been
<P>

married to the Sultan of Cashmere.  This was quite enough to induce
<P>

him to take the road to Cashmere, and to inquire at the first inn
<P>

at which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story. 
<P>

When he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he had
<P>

so long lost, he set about devising a plan for her rescue.
<P>

<P>

The first thing he did was to procure a doctor's robe, so that his dress,

<P>

added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his travels,
<P>

might unmistakably proclaim his profession.  He then lost no time
<P>

in going to the palace, where he obtained an audience of the
<P>

chief usher, and while apologising for his boldness in presuming
<P>

to think that he could cure the princess, where so many others
<P>

had failed, declared that he had the secret of certain remedies,
<P>

which had hitherto never failed of their effect.

This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story, and may I venture
<P>

to hope that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct,
<P>

your Highness<A NAME = "AO92715"></A> will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated?
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sidi-Nouman,&quot; replied the Caliph, &quot;your story is indeed a 
strange one,
<P>

and there is no excuse to be offered for your wife.  But, without
<P>

condemning your treatment of her, I wish you to reflect how much
<P>

she must suffer from being changed into an animal, and I hope you
<P>

will let that punishment be enough.  I do not order you to insist
<P>

upon the young magician finding the means to restore your wife to her
<P>

human shape, because I know that when once women such as she begin
<P>

to work evil they never leave off, and I should only bring down on
<P>

your head a vengeance far worse than the one you have undergone already.

In the reign<A NAME = "AO92897"></A><A NAME = "AS92898"></A> of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad<A NAME = "BB928925"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB933924"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> a
<P>

merchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child,
<P>

contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade. 
<P>

He had spent some years quite happily in the house his father had
<P>

left him, when three nights running he dreamed that an old man had

appeared to him, and reproached him for having neglected the duty
<P>

of a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his pilgrimage to Mecca.

not knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the seashore
<P>

he found a garden door open and walked in.
<P>

<P>

The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look up,
<P>

and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a Mussulman,

<P>

he told him to come in at once and to shut the door.
<P>

<P>

Camaralzaman did as he was bid, and inquired why this precaution
<P>

was taken.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Because,&quot; said the gardener, &quot;I see that you are a stranger 
and
<P>

a Mussulman<A NAME = "AO65505"></A><A NAME = "AS65506"></A>, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters<A NAME = "AB655025"></A>,
<P>

who hate and persecute all of our faith.  It seems almost a miracle
<P>

that has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that you
<P>

have found a place of safety.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Camaralzaman<A NAME = "AO65553"></A> warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter,
<P>

and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted him with:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Leave compliments alone.  You are weary and must be hungry. 
<P>

Come in, eat, and rest.&quot;  So saying he led the prince into his cottage,

<P>

and after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of
<P>

his arrival.
<P>

<P>

Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by inquiring
<P>

the shortest way to his father's capital.  &quot;For,&quot; added he,
<P>

&quot;if I tried to rejoin the princess, how should I find her after
<P>

eleven days' separation.  Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive!&quot;
<P>

At this terrible thought he burst into tears.

honour done to Khacan, said, &quot;Sire, it will be very difficult to find

<P>

a slave<A NAME = "AO71105"></A><A NAME = "AS71106"></A> as accomplished as your Majesty<A NAME = "AB711017"></A> desires, and, if she is
<P>

to be found, she will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Saouy,&quot; answered the king, &quot;you seem to find that a very 
great sum. 
<P>

For you it may be so, but not for me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present,
<P>

to send 10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the slave.
<P>

<P>

As soon, then, as Khacan<A NAME = "AO711911"></A> returned home he sent for the dealers in
<P>

female slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a one
<P>

as he described to inform him.  They promised to do their utmost,
<P>

and no day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection
<P>

but none was found without some defect.
<P>

<P>

At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to the
<P>

king's palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced eagerly

<P>

that a Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening, had a
<P>

slave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty.

<P>

<P>

Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave should
<P>

be brought for his inspection on his return from the palace. 
<P>

The dealer appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave
<P>

beautiful beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the name
<P>

of &quot;The Fair Persian.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the short
<P>

conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain another
<P>

slave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king,
<P>

<P>

<P>

There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son<A NAME = "AS789421"></A> called Aladdin<A NAME = "BB789426"></A><A HREF = "SPP263.HTM#BB78988"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long
<P>

in the streets with little idle boys like himself.  This so grieved
<P>

the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears
<P>

and prayers, Aladdin<A NAME = "AS78987"></A><A NAME = "BB78988"></A><A HREF = "SPP263.HTM#BB790215"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> did not mend his ways.  One day, when he
<P>

was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age,
<P>

and if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor.
<P>

<P>

&quot;I am, sir,&quot; replied<A NAME = "AS790212"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB790215"></A><A HREF = "SPP263.HTM#BB79085"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; &quot;but he died a long while ago.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

On this the stranger<A NAME = "AO79049"></A>, who was a famous African magician, fell on his
<P>

neck and kissed him, saying:  &quot;I am your uncle, and knew you from your

<P>

likeness to my brother.  Go to your mother and tell her I am coming.&quot;

<P>

<P>

Aladdin<A NAME = "AO79083"></A><A NAME = "AS79084"></A><A NAME = "BB79085"></A><A HREF = "SPP263.HTM#BB791316"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> ran home, and told his mother of his newly found uncle.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Indeed, child,&quot; she said, &quot;your father had a brother, but I 
always
<P>

thought he was dead.&quot;
<P>

<P>

However, she prepared<A NAME = "AS79137"></A> supper, and bade Aladdin<A NAME = "BB791316"></A><A HREF = "SPP263.HTM#BB791722"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> seek his uncle,
<P>

who came laden with wine and fruit.  He presently fell down and kissed
<P>

the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding<A NAME = "AS791517"></A> Aladdin's<A NAME = "AB791520"></A><A HREF = "SPP267.HTM#BB80104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> mother not
<P>

to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty
<P>

years out of the country.  He then turned<A NAME = "AS791717"></A> to Aladdin<A NAME = "BB791722"></A><A HREF = "SPP264.HTM#BB791915"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and asked him
<P>

his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst

of things, added:  &quot;If any of you can succeed in curing the princess,

<P>

I will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my heir.&quot;
<P>

<P>

An elderly<A NAME = "AO61525"></A><A NAME = "AS61526"></A> emir<A NAME = "AB61529"></A> present, fired with the desire to possess a young
<P>

and lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to try
<P>

the magic arts with which he was acquainted.
<P>

<P>

&quot;You are welcome to try,&quot; said the king, &quot;but I make one 
condition,
<P>

which is, that should you fail you will lose your life.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The emir<A NAME = "AO61595"></A> accepted the condition, and the king led him to the princess,
<P>

who, veiling her face, remarked, &quot;I am surprised, sire, that you
<P>

should bring an unknown man into my presence.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;You need not be shocked,&quot; said the king; &quot;this is one of my 
emirs
<P>

who asks your hand in marriage.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the princess, &quot;this is not the one you gave 
me
<P>

before and whose ring I wear.  Permit me to say that I can accept
<P>

no other.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The emir, who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense,
<P>

finding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that he
<P>

could not venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at his
<P>

Majesty's disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptly
<P>

had it cut off.
<P>

<P>

This was the first of many suitors for the princess whose inability
<P>

to cure her cost them their lives.

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO114905"></A> stepped through the window, but the bird took no notice,
<P>

continuing his song as before.
<P>

<P>

&quot;My slave,&quot; said the princess, &quot;this is the Sultan; make him

<P>

a pretty speech.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The bird stopped singing at once, and all the other birds stopped too.
<P>

<P>

&quot;The Sultan is welcome,&quot; he said.  &quot;I wish him long life

<P>

and all prosperity.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I thank you, good bird,&quot; answered the Sultan, seating himself

<P>

before the repast<A NAME = "AO115027"></A><A NAME = "AS115028"></A><A NAME = "AB115029"></A>, which was spread at a table near the window,
<P>

&quot;and I am enchanted to see in you the Sultan and King of the Birds.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan, noticing<A NAME = "AO115057"></A><A NAME = "AS115058"></A> that his favourite<A NAME = "AB1150515"></A> dish of cucumber was placed
<P>

before him, proceeded to help himself to it, and was amazed to and
<P>

that the stuffing<A NAME = "AO115077"></A><A NAME = "AS115078"></A> was of pearls<A NAME = "BB1150715"></A><A HREF = "SPP383.HTM#BB1150830"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  &quot;A novelty, indeed!&quot; cried he,

<P>

&quot;but I do not understand the reason of it; one<A NAME = "AO1150822"></A><A NAME = "AS1150823"></A> cannot eat pearls<A NAME = "BB1150830"></A><A HREF = "SPP383.HTM#BB1151215"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>!&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the bird, before either the princes or the 
princess
<P>

could speak, &quot;surely your Highness cannot be so surprised at beholding

<P>

a cucumber<A NAME = "AO115125"></A><A NAME = "AS115126"></A><A NAME = "AS115127"></A><A NAME = "BB115128"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF1138527"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stuffed with pearls<A NAME = "BB1151215"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF120231"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, when you believed without any
<P>

difficulty that the Sultana had presented you, instead of children,
<P>

with a dog, a cat, and a log of wood.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I believed it,&quot; answered the Sultan, &quot;because the women 
attending
<P>

on her told me so.&quot;

Thus arguing against my own conscience, I turned the key, when a smell
<P>

rushed out that, pleasant though it was, overcame me completely,
<P>

and I fell fainting across the threshold.  Instead of being warned
<P>

by this accident, directly I came to myself I went for a few
<P>

moments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume,
<P>

and then entered boldly.  I found myself in a large, vaulted room,
<P>

lighted by tapers, scented with aloes and ambergris, standing in golden

<P>

candle-sticks, whilst gold<A NAME = "AO31279"></A><A NAME = "AS312710"></A> and silver<A NAME = "AB312715"></A> lamps hung from the ceiling.
<P>

<P>

Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid them
<P>

scant attention, so much was I struck by a great black horse which stood

<P>

in one corner, the handsomest and best-shaped animal I had ever seen. 
<P>

His saddle<A NAME = "AO31325"></A> and bridle were of massive gold, curiously wrought;
<P>

one<A NAME = "AO31333"></A><A NAME = "AS31334"></A><A NAME = "AS31335"></A> side of his trough was filled with clean barley<A NAME = "AB313324"></A><A HREF = "SPP107.HTM#BB321627"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and sesame<A NAME = "AB313329"></A>,
<P>

and the other with rose water.  I led the animal into the open air,
<P>

and then jumped on his back, shaking the reins as I did so, but as he
<P>

never stirred, I touched him lightly with a switch I had picked up
<P>

in his stable.  No sooner did he feel the stroke, than he spread
<P>

his wings (which I had not perceived before), and flew up with me
<P>

straight into the sky.  When he had reached a prodigious height,
<P>

he next darted back to earth, and alighted on the terrace belonging
<P>

to a castle, shaking me violently out of the saddle as he did so,
<P>

and giving me such a blow with his tail, that he knocked out my
<P>

right eye.
<P>

<P>

Half-stunned as I was with all that had happened to me, I rose
<P>

to my feet, thinking as I did so of what had befallen the ten
<P>

young men, and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds. 
<P>

I left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall,
<P>

experiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing
<P>

as I wish.  You have only to go straight to Serendib and give
<P>

my message, then you are free to come back and do as you will. 
<P>

But go you must; my honour and dignity demand it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing
<P>

to obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way,
<P>

gave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage. 
<P>

I was soon ready to start, and taking the letter and the present I
<P>

embarked at Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib. 
<P>

Here, when I had disclosed my errand, I was well received,
<P>

and brought into the presence of the king, who greeted me with joy.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Welcome<A NAME = "AS45724"></A>, Sindbad<A NAME = "BB45727"></A><A HREF = "SPP155.HTM#BB465810"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,&quot; he cried.  &quot;I have thought of you often,

<P>

and rejoice to see you once more.&quot;
<P>

<P>

After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed the
<P>

Caliph's gifts.  First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold,
<P>

which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff. 

<P>

Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest white
<P>

linen<A NAME = "AS45793"></A><A NAME = "AS45794"></A><A NAME = "AS45795"></A><A NAME = "AS45796"></A><A NAME = "AB45797"></A><A HREF = "SPP329.HTM#BB989425"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> from Cairo<A NAME = "AB457912"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB933527"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, Suez<A NAME = "AB457915"></A>, Cufa, and Alexandria<A NAME = "AB457922"></A>.  Then more beds
<P>

of different<A NAME = "AO45805"></A><A NAME = "AS45806"></A> fashion, and an agate<A NAME = "AB458015"></A> vase carved with the figure
<P>

of a man<A NAME = "AS45817"></A> aiming an arrow at a lion<A NAME = "BB458120"></A><A HREF = "SPP374.HTM#BB1122617"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and finally a costly table,
<P>

which had once belonged to King Solomon.  The King of Serendib
<P>

received<A NAME = "AO45833"></A><A NAME = "AS45834"></A> with satisfaction the assurance of the Caliph's<A NAME = "AB458319"></A> friendliness
<P>

toward him, and now my task being accomplished I was anxious to depart,

<P>

but it was some time before the king would think of letting me go. 
<P>

At last, however, he dismissed me with many presents, and I lost
<P>

no time in going on board a ship, which sailed at once, and for four
<P>

days all went well.  On the fifth day we had the misfortune to fall
<P>

&quot;Oh certainly,&quot; said he, &quot;I am only glad I could be of use to
you
<P>

in the matter.  Here is the key of my shop; you will find the vase
<P>

in the place where you put it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Ali<A NAME = "AO94233"></A><A NAME = "AS94234"></A><A NAME = "BB94235"></A><A HREF = "SPP315.HTM#BB94495"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn,
<P>

where he opened it.  He thrust down his hand but could feel no money,
<P>

but still was persuaded it must be there.  So he got some plates
<P>

and vessels<A NAME = "AO94265"></A><A NAME = "AS94266"></A><A NAME = "AS94267"></A> from his travelling kit and emptied ont<A NAME = "AB942622"></A> the olives<A NAME = "BB942627"></A><A HREF = "SPP315.HTM#BB94599"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

To no purpose.  The gold was not there.  The poor man was dumb
<P>

with horror, then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, &quot;Can my old

<P>

friend really have committed such a crime?&quot;
<P>

<P>

In great haste he went back to the house of the merchant.  &quot;My friend,
&quot;
<P>

he cried, &quot;you will be astonished to see me again, but I can find
<P>

nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I placed in the
<P>

bottom under the olives.  Perhaps you may have taken a loan of them
<P>

for your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome. 
<P>

I will only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the money
<P>

at your leisure.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The merchant, who had expected something of the sort, had his reply
<P>

all ready.  &quot;Ali Cogia,&quot; he said, &quot;when you brought me the 
vase
<P>

of olives did I ever touch it?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you liked,

<P>

and did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in the
<P>

same state?  If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still. 
<P>

I know nothing about that; you only told me there were olives. 
<P>

You can believe me or not, but I have not laid a finger on the vase.&quot;

and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat
<P>

and drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party

<P>

of white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about. 
<P>

Reassured by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards them
<P>

and they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came. 
<P>

My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly
<P>

satisfied their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked,
<P>

and captured by the blacks.  &quot;But these savages devour men!&quot; said 
they. 
<P>

&quot;How did you escape?&quot;  I repeated to them what I have just told 
you,
<P>

at which they were mightily astonished.  I stayed with them until
<P>

they had collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they
<P>

took me back to their own country and presented me to their king,
<P>

by whom I was hospitably received.  To him also I had to relate
<P>

my adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished he
<P>

ordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treated
<P>

with consideration.
<P>

<P>

The island on which I found myself was full of people, and abounded
<P>

in all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of traffic
<P>

went on in the capital, where I soon began to feel at home
<P>

and contented.  Moreover, the king treated me with special favour,
<P>

and in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or in
<P>

the town, sought to make life pleasant to me.  One thing I remarked
<P>

which I thought very strange; this was that, from the greatest
<P>

to the least, all men<A NAME = "AO395311"></A><A NAME = "AS395312"></A><A NAME = "AS395313"></A> rode their horses<A NAME = "AB395320"></A><A HREF = "SPP209.HTM#BB628012"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> without bridle or stirrups<A NAME = "AB395329"></A>. 
<P>

I one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them,
<P>

to which he replied, &quot;You speak to me of things of which I have never

<P>

before heard!&quot;  This gave me an idea.  I found a clever workman,
<P>

and made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle,
<P>

which I wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning it
<P>

Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his books, showed himself
<P>

very indifferent to his sentence.
<P>

<P>

When night came he washed himself, performed his devotions,
<P>

and, having read some pages<A NAME = "AS573311"></A> of the Koran<A NAME = "BB573318"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF197214"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, lay down on a couch,
<P>

without putting out the light near him, and was soon asleep.
<P>

<P>

Now there was a deep well in the tower in which Prince
<P>

Camaralzaman<A NAME = "AO57373"></A><A NAME = "AS57374"></A> was imprisoned, and this well was a favourite<A NAME = "AB573721"></A>
<P>

resort of the fairy Maimoune, daughter of Damriat, chief of a
<P>

legion of genii.  Towards midnight Maimoune floated lightly
<P>

up from the well, intending, according to her usual habit,
<P>

to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might prompt.
<P>

<P>

The light in the prince's room surprised her, and without disturbing
<P>

the slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered the room,
<P>

and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied.
<P>

<P>

The prince<A NAME = "AO57475"></A> lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet. 
<P>

Maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth
<P>

she had ever seen.
<P>

<P>

&quot;What a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open!&quot;
<P>

she thought.  &quot;What can he have done to deserve to be treated
<P>

like this?&quot;
<P>

<P>

She could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but at length,
<P>

having softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replaced
<P>

the coverlet and resumed her flight through the air.

<P>

concluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such a
<P>

heavy loss.
<P>

<P>

The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the merchant, and inquired
<P>

why he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question.
<P>

<P>

The false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchant
<P>

had given<A NAME = "AS95475"></A> to the Cadi<A NAME = "AB954712"></A> of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that he
<P>

had told the truth.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Stop a moment!&quot; said the little Cadi, &quot;before we come to 
oaths,
<P>

I should like to examine the vase with the olives.  Ali Cogia,&quot;
<P>

he added, &quot;have you got the vase with you?&quot; and finding he had 
not,
<P>

the Cadi continued, &quot;Go and get it, and bring it to me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and then pretended
<P>

to lay a vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his vase,
<P>

which he had given to the accused for safe custody; and in order
<P>

to be quite correct, the Cadi<A NAME = "AO955813"></A> asked the merchant if he recognised it
<P>

as the same vase.  By his silence the merchant admitted the fact,
<P>

and the Cadi<A NAME = "AO95607"></A> then commanded to have the vase opened.  Ali Cogia
<P>

made a movement as if he was taking off the lid, and the little
<P>

Cadi<A NAME = "AO95623"></A><A NAME = "AS95624"></A> on his part made a pretence<A NAME = "BB956217"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF760619"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of peering into a vase.
<P>

<P>

&quot;What beautiful olives!&quot; he said, &quot;I should like to taste 
one,&quot;
<P>

and pretending to put one in his mouth, he added, &quot;they are
<P>

really excellent!
<P>

<P>

&quot;But,&quot; he went on, &quot;it seems to me odd that olives seven 
years

To which I replied, &quot;Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity. 

<P>

For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own country.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;It is well,&quot; he answered, &quot;the monsoon<A NAME = "AO468219"></A><A NAME = "AS468220"></A> will soon bring the 
ivory<A NAME = "AB468232"></A>
<P>

ships hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat to pay
<P>

your passage.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and every
<P>

day we added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houses
<P>

were overflowing with it.  By this time the other merchants
<P>

knew the secret, but there was enough and to spare for all. 
<P>

When the ships at last arrived my master himself chose the one
<P>

in which I was to sail, and put on board for me a great store of
<P>

choice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and all the costliest
<P>

curiosities of the country, for which I could not thank him enough,
<P>

and so we parted.  I left the ship at the first port we came to,
<P>

not feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had happened to me
<P>

by reason of it, and having disposed of my ivory for much gold,
<P>

and bought many rare and costly presents, I loaded my pack animals,
<P>

and joined a caravan of merchants.  Our journey was long and tedious,
<P>

but I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had not to
<P>

fear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils
<P>

from which I had suffered before, and at length we reached<A NAME = "AS470123"></A> Bagdad<A NAME = "BB470126"></A><A HREF = "SPP180.HTM#BB54158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

My first<A NAME = "AO47025"></A> care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give him
<P>

an account of my embassy.  He assured me that my long absence had
<P>

disquieted him much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best. 
<P>

As to my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement,
<P>

declaring that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness
<P>

been well known to him.
<P>

<P>


as to what dishes should be served.
<P>

<P>

&quot;My dear mistress,&quot; replied the bird, &quot;your cooks are very 
good
<P>

and you can safely leave all to them, except that you must be
<P>

careful to have a dish<A NAME = "AS1134311"></A> of cucumbers<A NAME = "AB1134316"></A><A HREF = "SPP378.HTM#BB113467"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, stuffed with pearl sauce,
<P>

served with the first course.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Cucumbers<A NAME = "AO113464"></A><A NAME = "AS113465"></A><A NAME = "AS113466"></A><A NAME = "BB113467"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF1134316"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stuffed with pearls<A NAME = "BB1134614"></A><A HREF = "SPP378.HTM#BB1136131"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>!&quot; exclaimed the princess.  &quot;
Why, bird,
<P>

who ever heard of such a dish?  The Sultan<A NAME = "AO1134720"></A> will expect a dinner he
<P>

can eat, and not one he can only admire!  Besides, if I were to use
<P>

all the pearls I possess, they would not be half enough.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Mistress,&quot; replied the bird, &quot;do what I tell you and nothing

<P>

but good will come of it.  And as to the pearls, if you go at dawn
<P>

to-morrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park,
<P>

on the right hand, you will find as many as you want.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The princess had faith in the bird, who generally proved to be right,
<P>

and taking the gardener with her early next morning followed out
<P>

his directions carefully.  After digging for some time they came
<P>

upon a golden<A NAME = "AO113597"></A><A NAME = "AS113598"></A><A NAME = "AB113599"></A> box fastened with little clasps.
<P>

<P>

These were easily undone, and the box<A NAME = "AO1136115"></A><A NAME = "AS1136116"></A> was found to be full of pearls<A NAME = "BB1136131"></A><A HREF = "SPP379.HTM#BB1138623"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

not very large ones, but well-shaped and of a good colour. 
<P>

So leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the tree,

<P>

the princess<A NAME = "AO113645"></A> took up the box and returned to the house.
<P>

<P>

The two princes had seen her go out, and had wondered what could have
<P>

made her rise so early.  Full of curiosity they got up and dressed,
<P>

and met their sister as she was returning with the box under her arm.

<P>


<P>

In the kingdom of Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows,
<P>

situated on the frontiers of Great Tartary, there lived long ago
<P>

a tailor<A NAME = "AO47425"></A> and his wife who loved each other very much.  One day,
<P>

when the tailor was hard at work, a little<A NAME = "AO474319"></A><A NAME = "AS474320"></A> hunchback<A NAME = "AB474323"></A><A HREF = "SPP158.HTM#BB475311"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> came and sat at
<P>

the entrance<A NAME = "AO47445"></A><A NAME = "AS47446"></A> of the shop, and began to sing and play his tambourine<A NAME = "BB474429"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF152025"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

The tailor<A NAME = "AO47455"></A> was amused with the antics of the fellow, and thought
<P>

he would take him home to divert his wife.  The hunchback having
<P>

agreed to his proposal, the tailor closed his shop and they set
<P>

off together.
<P>

<P>

When they reached the house they found the table ready laid for supper,

<P>

and in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a beautiful
<P>

fish which the tailor's wife had cooked with her own hands. 
<P>

But unluckily, the hunchback<A NAME = "AO47539"></A><A NAME = "AS475310"></A><A NAME = "BB475311"></A><A HREF = "SPP158.HTM#BB476317"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> happened to swallow a large bone,
<P>

and, in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him,
<P>

died of suffocation in an instant.  Besides being very sorry for
<P>

the poor man, the tailor and his wife were very much frightened on
<P>

their own account, for if the police came to hear of it the worthy
<P>

couple<A NAME = "AO47583"></A><A NAME = "AS47584"></A> ran the risk of being thrown into prison<A NAME = "BB475821"></A><A HREF = "SPP163.HTM#BB489523"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> for wilful murder. 
<P>

In order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both set about
<P>

inventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one else,
<P>

and at last they made up their minds that they could do no better than
<P>

select a Jewish doctor who lived close by as the author of the crime. 
<P>

So the tailor<A NAME = "AO47637"></A><A NAME = "AS47638"></A> picked up the hunchback<A NAME = "BB476317"></A><A HREF = "SPP160.HTM#BB481929"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> by his head while his wife
<P>

took his feet and carried him to the doctor's house.  Then they
<P>

knocked at the door, which opened straight on to a steep staircase. 
<P>

A servant soon appeared, feeling her way down the dark staircase
<P>

and inquired what they wanted.
<P>

The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest,
<P>

now drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the dead
<P>

bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen
<P>

out of its inside.  He picked it up, and what was his surprise when he
<P>

recognised the Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the cause
<P>

of many misfortunes.  It would be impossible to describe his joy;
<P>

he kissed the talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and carefully
<P>

tied it round his arm.  For the first time since his separation
<P>

from the princess he had a good night, and next morning he was up
<P>

at day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do.
<P>

<P>

The gardener<A NAME = "AO67305"></A><A NAME = "AS67306"></A> told him to cut down an old fruit<A NAME = "AB673023"></A> tree which had quite
<P>

died away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously. 
<P>

As he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard. 

<P>

On pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze,
<P>

under which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps. 
<P>

He went down them and found himself in a roomy kind of cave
<P>

in which stood fifty large bronze jars, each with a cover on it. 
<P>

The prince uncovered one after another, and found them all filled
<P>

with gold dust.  Delighted with his discovery he left the cave,
<P>

replaced the slab, and having finished cutting down the tree waited
<P>

for the gardener's return.
<P>

<P>

The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which he
<P>

was inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not being yet
<P>

known he had been told to return next day for further information. 
<P>

He had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good news
<P>

beaming in his face.
<P>

<P>

&quot;My son,&quot; said he, &quot;rejoice and hold yourself ready to start

The first<A NAME = "AO57895"></A> palace is entirely composed of rock crystal, the second

of bronze, the third<A NAME = "AS57909"></A> of fine steel<A NAME = "BB579016"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF119217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the fourth of another and more

<P>

sumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens surrounding them are
<P>

laid out with exquisite taste.  In fact, neither trouble nor cost
<P>

has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess. 
<P>

The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide, and many
<P>

powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage. 
<P>

The king has always received these embassies graciously, but says
<P>

that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will,
<P>

and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys have
<P>

had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they
<P>

were gratified by their magnificent receptions.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; said the princess to her father, &quot;you wish me to 
marry,
<P>

and I know you desire to please me, for which I am very grateful. 
<P>

But, indeed, I have no inclination to change my state,
<P>

for where could I find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful
<P>

and delightful surroundings?  I feel that I could never be as happy
<P>

with any husband as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on me.&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;At last<A NAME = "AO58116"></A> an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that the

<P>

King<A NAME = "AO58123"></A><A NAME = "AS58124"></A><A NAME = "AB58125"></A><A HREF = "SPP210.HTM#BB63284"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of China felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter. 
<P>

He told her how important such an alliance would be, and pressed
<P>

her to consent.  In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that the
<P>

princess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due
<P>

to her father.  &quot;Sire,&quot; cried she angrily, &quot;do not speak 
further
<P>

of this or any other marriage or I will plunge this dagger in my
<P>

breast and so escape from all these importunities.&quot;

shipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and
<P>

risk fresh trouble.  I am even surprised myself when I look back,
<P>

but evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose
<P>

I prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties
<P>

of my friends and relations, who did all they could to keep me
<P>

at home.  Instead of going by the Persian Gulf, I travelled
<P>

a considerable way overland, and finally embarked from a distant
<P>

Indian<A NAME = "AO43083"></A><A NAME = "AS43084"></A><A NAME = "AB43085"></A> port with a captain who meant to make a long voyage. 
<P>

And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy weather which drove
<P>

us completely out of our course, so that for many days neither
<P>

captain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were going. 
<P>

When they did at last discover our position we had small ground
<P>

for rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deck
<P>

and tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerous
<P>

spot<A NAME = "AO43153"></A> upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which
<P>

was at that minute sweeping us to destruction.  It was too true! 
<P>

In spite of all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful
<P>

rapidity towards the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer out
<P>
<P>

will be punishment enough.&quot;
<P>

<P>

His first passion spent, the Sultan<A NAME = "AO1065113"></A> had regained his self-command.
<P>

&quot;Let her live then,&quot; he said, &quot;since you have it so much at 
heart. 
<P>

But if I grant her life it shall only be on one condition, which shall
<P>

make her daily pray for death.  Let a box be built for her at the door
<P>

of the principal<A NAME = "AO106557"></A><A NAME = "AS106558"></A> mosque, and let the window<A NAME = "AB1065519"></A> of the box be always open. 

<P>

There she shall sit, in the coarsest clothes, and every Mussulman
<P>

who enters the mosque shall spit in her face in passing.  Anyone that
<P>

refuses to obey shall be exposed to the same punishment himself. 
<P>

You, vizir, will see that my orders are carried out.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The grand-vizir saw that it was useless to say more, and, full of triumph,

<P>

the sisters watched the building of the box, and then listened to the
<P>

jeers of the people at the helpless Sultana sitting inside.  But the poor

<P>

lady bore herself with so much dignity and meekness that it was not long

<P>

before she had won the sympathy of those that were best among the crowd.

<P>

<P>

But it is now time to return to the fate of the third baby,
<P>

this time a princess.  Like its brothers, it was found by the
<P>

intendant<A NAME = "AO106693"></A><A NAME = "AS106694"></A><A NAME = "AB106695"></A> of the gardens, and adopted by him and his wife,
<P>

and all three were brought up with the greatest care and tenderness.
<P>

<P>

As the children<A NAME = "AO106727"></A><A NAME = "AS106728"></A> grew older their beauty and air<A NAME = "AB1067221"></A> of distinction
<P>

became more and more marked, and their manners had all the grace
<P>

and ease that is proper to people of high birth.  The princes had
<P>

been named by their foster-father Bahman and Perviz, after two of
<P>

the ancient<A NAME = "AS106765"></A> kings of Persia<A NAME = "BB1067612"></A><A HREF = "SPP361.HTM#BB1084222"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, while the princess was called Parizade,
<P>

or the child of the genii.

At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we
<P>

directed our steps.  As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed
<P>

out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their houses,

<P>

and as it were divided among our captors.  I with five others
<P>

was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground,
<P>

and certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs
<P>

to us to eat.  Observing that they themselves did not touch them,
<P>

I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions,
<P>

being very hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them,
<P>

and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad. 
<P>

Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word
<P>

they said, nor did they heed when I spoke to them.  The savages
<P>

now produced<A NAME = "AO39125"></A><A NAME = "AS39126"></A><A NAME = "AS39127"></A> large bowls full of rice<A NAME = "AB391218"></A><A HREF = "SPP298.HTM#BB895227"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> prepared with cocoanut<A NAME = "AB391225"></A> oil,
<P>

of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains,

<P>

understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us
<P>

speedily for their own eating, and this was exactly what happened. 
<P>

My unlucky companions having lost their reason, felt neither
<P>

anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that was offered them. 
<P>

So they were soon fat and there was an end of them, but I grew
<P>

leaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that little did me
<P>

no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me.  However, as I
<P>

was so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to wander
<P>

about freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off upon
<P>

some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managed
<P>

to escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster
<P>

the more he cried to me to come back, until I had completely
<P>

distanced him.
<P>

<P>

For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me,

<P>

&quot;I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together.
&quot; 
<P>

Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to spend only
<P>

the tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself. 
<P>

While he was gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through the
<P>

gardens<A NAME = "AO75643"></A><A NAME = "AS75644"></A> and went up the white marble<A NAME = "AB756417"></A> staircase of the pavilion as far
<P>

as the locked door of the saloon.  On the return of Scheih Ibrahim
<P>

they begged him to open it, and to allow them to enter and admire
<P>

the magnificence within.  Consenting, he brought not only the key,
<P>

but a light, and immediately unlocked the door.  Noureddin and the
<P>

Persian entering, were dazzled with the magnificence they beheld. 
<P>

The paintings and furniture were of astonishing beauty, and between
<P>

each<A NAME = "AO75713"></A><A NAME = "AS75714"></A> window was a silver<A NAME = "AB757113"></A> arm holding a candle.
<P>

<P>

Scheih<A NAME = "AO75733"></A><A NAME = "AS75734"></A><A NAME = "BB75735"></A><A HREF = "SPP253.HTM#BB75915"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and all
<P>

three ate together.  When they had finished eating Noureddin
<P>

asked the old man to bring them a bottle of wine.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Heaven forbid,&quot; said Scheih Ibrahim, &quot;that I should come in 
contact
<P>

with wine!  I who have four<A NAME = "AO757814"></A> times made the pilgrimage to Mecca,
<P>

and have renounced wine for ever.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;You would, however, do us a great service in procuring
<P>

us some,&quot; said Noureddin.  &quot;You need not touch it yourself. 
<P>

Take the ass which is tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest
<P>

wine-shop, and ask some passer-by to order two jars of wine;
<P>

have them put<A NAME = "AO75857"></A><A NAME = "AS75858"></A> in the ass's panniers<A NAME = "AB758517"></A>, and drive him before you. 
<P>

Here are two pieces of gold for the expenses.&quot;
<P>

<P>

At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to execute
<P>

very grateful to you for it.  But kings do not like to have their
<P>

offers refused, and in time he would bear a grudge against you,
<P>

which would render me very unhappy.  Consult the Talking Bird,
<P>

who is wise and far-seeing, and let me hear what he says.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So the bird was sent for and the case laid before him.
<P>

<P>

&quot;The princes<A NAME = "AO112866"></A><A NAME = "AS112867"></A> must on no account refuse the Sultan's<A NAME = "AB1128622"></A> proposal,&quot;

<P>

said he, &quot;and they must even invite him to come and see your house.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;But, bird,&quot; objected the princess, &quot;you know how dearly we 
love
<P>

each other; will not all this spoil our friendship?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied the bird, &quot;it will make it all the 
closer.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Then the Sultan will have to see me,&quot; said the princess.
<P>

<P>

The bird answered that it was necessary that he should see her,
<P>

and everything would turn out for the best.
<P>

<P>

The following morning, when the Sultan inquired if they had spoken
<P>

to their sister and what advice she had given them, Prince Bahman
<P>

replied that they were ready to agree to his Highness's wishes,
<P>

and that their sister had reproved them for their hesitation about
<P>

the matter.  The Sultan<A NAME = "AO113039"></A> received their excuses with great kindness,
<P>

and told them that he was sure they would be equally faithful to him,
<P>

and kept them by his side for the rest of the day, to the vexation
<P>

of the grand-vizir and the rest of the court.
<P>

<P>

When the procession<A NAME = "AO113087"></A><A NAME = "AS113088"></A> entered in this order the gates<A NAME = "AB1130821"></A> of the capital,

&quot;What have you been doing?&quot; they asked, &quot;and did the gardener
come
<P>

to tell you he had found a treasure?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied the princess, &quot;it is I who have 
found one,&quot;
<P>

and opening the box she showed her astonished brothers the
<P>

pearls inside.  Then, on the way back to the palace, she told them
<P>

of her consultation with the bird, and the advice it had given her. 
<P>

All three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel,
<P>

but they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them,
<P>

and they must be content blindly to obey.
<P>

<P>

The first thing the princess did on entering the palace was to send
<P>

for the head cook and to order the repast for the Sultan When she
<P>

had finished she suddenly added, &quot;Besides the dishes I have mentioned

<P>

there is one that you must prepare expressly for the Sultan, and that
<P>

no one must touch but yourself.  It consists<A NAME = "AO1138517"></A><A NAME = "AS1138518"></A> of a stuffed cucumber<A NAME = "AB1138527"></A><A HREF = "SPP383.HTM#BB115128"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

and the stuffing<A NAME = "AO113867"></A><A NAME = "AS113868"></A> is to be made of these pearls<A NAME = "BB1138623"></A><A HREF = "SPP383.HTM#BB1150715"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The head cook, who had never in all his experience heard of such
<P>

a dish, stepped back in amazement.
<P>

<P>

&quot;You think I am mad,&quot; answered the princess, who perceived what 
was
<P>

in his mind.  &quot;But I know quite well what I am doing.  Go, and do
<P>

your best, and take the pearls with you.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The next morning the princes started for the forest, and were soon
<P>

joined by the Sultan.  The hunt began and continued till mid-day,
<P>

when the heat became so great that they were obliged to leave off. 
<P>

Then, as arranged, they turned their horses' heads towards the palace,
<P>
<P>

When the princess's messenger entered his room, Prince Firouz Schah
<P>

was in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be allowed to pay
<P>

his homage to her mistress:  but on hearing the princess's wishes,
<P>

he at once gave way.  &quot;Her will is my law,&quot; he said, &quot;I am 
only
<P>

here to obey her orders.&quot;
<P>

<P>

In a few moments the princess herself appeared, and after the usual
<P>

compliments had passed between them, the princess sat down on a sofa,
<P>

and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him
<P>

an audience in her own apartments.  &quot;Had I done so,&quot; she said,

<P>

&quot;we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the 
eunuchs,
<P>

who has the right to enter whenever it pleases him, whereas this
<P>

is forbidden ground.  I am all impatience to learn the wonderful
<P>

accident<A NAME = "AO99433"></A> which has procured the pleasure of your arrival, and that
<P>

is why I have come to you here, where no one can intrude upon us. 
<P>

Begin then, I entreat you, without delay.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So the prince began at the beginning, and told all the story of the
<P>

festival<A NAME = "AO99483"></A><A NAME = "AS99484"></A><A NAME = "AS99485"></A><A NAME = "AB99486"></A> of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia<A NAME = "BB994819"></A><A HREF = "SPP334.HTM#BB1001912"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and of the splendid spectacles

<P>

celebrated in its honour.  But when he came to the enchanted horse,
<P>

the princess declared that she could never have imagined anything
<P>

half so surprising.  &quot;Well then,&quot; continued the prince, &quot;you 
can
<P>

easily understand how the King my father, who has a passion for
<P>

all curious things, was seized with a violent desire to possess
<P>

this horse, and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it.
<P>

<P>

&quot;The man's answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when I

<P>

tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess
<P>

my sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked,
<P>
<P>

my account, and I only am the murderer; and although I am innocent
<P>

of any wish to commit a crime, I must suffer for it all the same,
<P>

or else have the blood of two Musselmans on my conscience. 
<P>

Therefore send away this man, I pray you, and let me take his place,
<P>

as it is I who am guilty.&quot;
<P>

<P>

On hearing the declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of police
<P>

commanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the Sultan's
<P>

purveyor go free.  The cord<A NAME = "AO495711"></A><A NAME = "AS495712"></A> was placed round the Jew's<A NAME = "AB495723"></A> neck,
<P>

and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the voice
<P>

of the tailor<A NAME = "AO49597"></A><A NAME = "AS49598"></A> was heard beseeching the executioner<A NAME = "BB495919"></A><A HREF = "SPP166.HTM#BB49937"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to pause one
<P>

moment and to listen to what he had to say.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Oh, my lord,&quot; he cried, turning to the chief of police,
<P>

&quot;how nearly have you caused the death of three innocent people! 
<P>

But if you will only have the patience to listen to my tale,
<P>

you shall know who is the real culprit.  If some one has to suffer,
<P>

it must be me!  Yesterday, at dusk, I was working in my shop with a
<P>

light heart when the little hunchback, who was more than half drunk,
<P>

came and sat in the doorway.  He sang me several songs, and then
<P>

I invited him to finish the evening at my house.  He accepted
<P>

my invitation, and we went away together.  At supper I helped him
<P>

to a slice of fish, but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat,
<P>

and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes.  We felt deeply

<P>

sorry for his death, but fearing lest we should be held responsible,
<P>

we carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor.  I knocked,
<P>

and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fast
<P>

as possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure;
<P>

and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece of money
<P>

in her hand as the doctor's fee.  Directly she had disappeared I

that, in order to do this, it was only needful to turn the screw
<P>

the reverse way; but, to his surprise and horror, he found that,
<P>

turn as he might, he did not make the smallest impression. 
<P>

He then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to get
<P>

back to earth again, and understood the danger in which he stood. 
<P>

Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set about examining the
<P>

horse's neck with great care, till at last, to his intense joy,
<P>

he discovered a tiny little peg, much smaller than the other,
<P>

close to the right ear.  This he turned, and found him-self dropping
<P>

to the earth, though more slowly than he had left it.
<P>

<P>

It was now dark, and as the prince could see nothing, he was obliged,
<P>

not without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the horse to direct
<P>

his own<A NAME = "AO98225"></A> course, and midnight was already passed before Prince Firouz
<P>

Schah<A NAME = "AO98233"></A> again touched the ground, faint and weary from his long ride,
<P>

and from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning.
<P>

<P>

The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out where
<P>

he was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick darkness,
<P>

he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace, with a
<P>

balustrade<A NAME = "AS98293"></A><A NAME = "AB98294"></A> of marble running round.  In one corner of the terrace stood

<P>

a small door, opening<A NAME = "AO98309"></A> on to a staircase which led down into the palace.

<P>

<P>

Some people might have hesitated before exploring further, but not
<P>

so the prince.  &quot;I am doing no harm,&quot; he said, &quot;and whoever 
the owner
<P>

may be, he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed,&quot; and in dread

<P>

of making a false step, he went cautiously down the staircase. 
<P>

On a landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was a faintly
<P>

lighted hall.

<P>

We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The prince<A NAME = "AO67825"></A> took this advice, and spent the rest of the day filling
<P>

the fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip
<P>

from his arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of putting
<P>

it in one of the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be able
<P>

to recognise it.  When night came the jars were all ready,
<P>

and the prince and his host went to bed.
<P>

<P>

Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and excitement

<P>

of the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener passed a very
<P>

bad night.  He was worse next day, and by the morning of the third day was

<P>

dangerously ill.  At daybreak the ship's captain and some of his sailors

<P>

knocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger who was to embark.

<P>

<P>

&quot;I am he,&quot; said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door. 
<P>

&quot;The gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see you,
<P>

but please come in and take these jars of olives and my bag,
<P>

and I will follow as soon as I have taken leave of him.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving charged
<P>

Camaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he wished
<P>

to set sail at once.
<P>

<P>

As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage
<P>

to bid farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more
<P>

for all his kindness.  But the old man was at his last gasp,
<P>

and had barely murmured his confession of faith when he expired.

<P>


round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh choked,
<P>

and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the ground. 
<P>

When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he had released

<P>

his hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me revive
<P>

he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other,
<P>

until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees

<P>

while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits.  This went on all day,
<P>

and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness,
<P>

the terrible old<A NAME = "AO42077"></A> man held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail
<P>

to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me
<P>

with his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march
<P>

with rage and bitterness in my heart.
<P>

<P>

It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several
<P>

dry gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping
<P>

out its contents and pressing into it the juice of several
<P>

bunches<A NAME = "AO42153"></A><A NAME = "AS42154"></A> of grapes<A NAME = "AB42159"></A> which hung from every bush.  When it was full
<P>

I left it propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later,
<P>

carrying the hateful old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as I
<P>

passed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine
<P>

so good and refreshing that I even forgot my detestable burden,
<P>

and began to sing and caper.
<P>

<P>

The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught
<P>

had produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so he
<P>

stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted
<P>

its contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop. 
<P>

The wine was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also began
<P>

to sing after a fashion, and soon I had the delight of feeling
<P>

the iron grip of his goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorous
<P>

which I knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me,
<P>

by the ten blue sofas against the wall.
<P>

<P>

The ten young men were not present when I first entered, but came
<P>

in soon after, accompanied by the old man.  They greeted me kindly,
<P>

and bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed, they had expected
<P>

nothing less.  &quot;All that has happened to you,&quot; they said, &quot;we
also
<P>

have undergone, and we should be enjoying the same happiness still,
<P>

had we not opened the Golden Door while the princesses were absent. 
<P>

You have been no wiser than we, and have suffered the same punishment. 

<P>

We would gladly receive you among us, to perform such penance
<P>

as we do, but we have already told you that this is impossible. 
<P>

Depart<A NAME = "AS31613"></A>, therefore, from hence and go to the Court<A NAME = "AB316120"></A> of Bagdad,
<P>

where you shall meet with him that can decide your destiny.&quot; 
<P>

They told me the way I was to travel, and I left them.
<P>

<P>

On the road I caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and put
<P>

on a Calender's habit.  I have had a long journey, but arrived this
<P>

evening in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate,
<P>

being strangers like myself.  We wondered much at one another,
<P>

to see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure
<P>

to discourse at length of our common calamities.  We had only so much
<P>

time as to come hither to implore those favours which you have been
<P>

generously pleased to grant us.
<P>

<P>

He finished, and it was Zobeida's<A NAME = "AS317413"></A><A NAME = "AB317414"></A> turn to speak:  &quot;Go wherever
<P>

you please,&quot; she said, addressing all three.  &quot;I pardon you all,

<P>

but you must depart immediately out of this house.&quot;

He has now returned; so take your horse, and begone for ever.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Indian<A NAME = "AO101715"></A> hastily quitted the presence of the Sultan, and when he
<P>

was outside, he inquired of the man who had taken him out of prison
<P>

where the prince had really been all this time, and what he had
<P>

been doing.  They told him the whole story, and how the Princess
<P>

of Bengal<A NAME = "AO101755"></A><A NAME = "AS101756"></A><A NAME = "AB101757"></A><A HREF = "SPP347.HTM#BB104257"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> was even then awaiting in the country palace the consent
<P>

of the Sultan, which at once put into the Indian's head a plan
<P>

of revenge for the treatment he had experienced.  Going straight to
<P>

the country house, he informed the doorkeeper who was left in charge
<P>

that he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of Persia to
<P>

fetch the princess on the enchanted horse, and to bring her to the palace.

<P>

<P>

The doorkeeper<A NAME = "AO101825"></A> knew the Indian by sight, and was of course aware
<P>

that nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison
<P>

by the Sultan; and seeing him at liberty, the man took for granted
<P>

that he was speaking the truth, and made no difficulty about
<P>

leading him before the Princess of Bengal; while on her side,
<P>

hearing that he had come from the prince, the lady gladly consented
<P>

to do what he wished.
<P>

<P>

The Indian, delighted with the success of his scheme,
<P>

mounted the horse, assisted the princess to mount behind him,
<P>

and turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving
<P>

the palace in Schiraz for the country house, followed closely by the
<P>

Sultan and all the court.  Knowing this, the Indian deliberately
<P>

steered the horse right above the city, in order that his revenge
<P>

for his unjust imprisonment<A NAME = "AO101969"></A><A NAME = "AS1019610"></A> might be all the quicker and sweeter<A NAME = "AB1019625"></A>.
<P>

<P>

When the Sultan<A NAME = "AO101987"></A><A NAME = "AS101988"></A><A NAME = "AB101989"></A><A HREF = "SPP373.HTM#BB1119516"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Persia saw the horse and its riders, he stopped short

all understand how we were to do it.  The crowns of the cocoa-palms
<P>

were all alive with monkeys, big and little, which skipped from
<P>

one to the other with surprising agility, seeming to be curious
<P>

about us and disturbed at our appearance, and I was at first
<P>

surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw
<P>

them at the lively creatures, which seemed to me quite harmless. 
<P>

But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily,
<P>

for the monkeys<A NAME = "AO42667"></A><A NAME = "AS42668"></A><A NAME = "AB42669"></A>, annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin,
<P>

began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry
<P>

and spiteful gestures, so that after very little labour our sacks
<P>

were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained.
<P>

<P>

As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town,
<P>

where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the same
<P>

occupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to my own country. 

<P>

This I did, and before long had amassed a considerable sum. 
<P>

Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail,
<P>

and taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with me
<P>

a goodly store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islands
<P>

where pepper grows, then to Comari where the best aloes wood
<P>

is found, and where men drink no wine by an unalterable law. 
<P>

Here I exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood, and went
<P>

a-fishing for pearls with some of the other merchants, and my divers
<P>

were so lucky that very soon I had an immense number, and those
<P>

very large and perfect.  With all these treasures I came joyfully
<P>

back to Bagdad<A NAME = "AS42847"></A><A NAME = "BB42848"></A><A HREF = "SPP149.HTM#BB448210"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, where I disposed of them for large sums of money,
<P>

of which I did not fail as before to give the tenth part to the poor,
<P>

and after that I rested from my labours and comforted myself with
<P>

all the pleasures that my riches could give me.

the Caliph, saying, &quot;Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now;

<P>

it is for your Highness to condemn him to death and not for me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Then the Caliph, convinced that the man was a thief, bade them take
<P>

him away and hang him, which was done, but not before he had confessed
<P>

his guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali Cogia's money. 
<P>

The Caliph<A NAME = "AO96655"></A> ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out justice from
<P>

the mouth<A NAME = "AO96665"></A> of a child, and sent the boy home, with a purse containing
<P>

a hundred pieces of gold as a mark of his favour.

all the feasts<A NAME = "AO96767"></A><A NAME = "AS96768"></A> in the Kingdom<A NAME = "AB967615"></A> of Persia, and the day had been spent
<P>

by the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificent
<P>

spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival. 
<P>

The sun was setting, and the monarch was about to give his court the
<P>

signal to retire, when suddenly an Indian<A NAME = "AO968015"></A> appeared before his throne,
<P>

leading a horse richly harnessed, and looking in every respect
<P>

exactly like a real one.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, &quot;although I
make
<P>

my appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidently
<P>

assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day
<P>

can be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes
<P>

upon him.&quot;

goods to the best advantage, hoping to gain some customers among

the passers-by.
<P>

<P>

Very<A NAME = "AO93323"></A> soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when they
<P>

had turned it over, one said to the other:
<P>

<P>

&quot;If this man was wise he would take<A NAME = "AS933518"></A> these things to Cairo<A NAME = "BB933527"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB934018"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, where he

<P>

would get a much better price than he is likely to do here.&quot;

<P>

He packed<A NAME = "AS93395"></A> up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad<A NAME = "BB933924"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB935016"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

joined<A NAME = "AS93403"></A> a caravan that was going to Cairo<A NAME = "BB934018"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF457912"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The results of the journey
<P>

gladdened his heart.  He sold off everything almost directly,
<P>

at Damascus<A NAME = "AS93435"></A><A NAME = "AB93436"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB934813"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; but as the caravan with which he would have to travel

would not be starting for another six weeks, he took advantage
<P>

of the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of the cities along

the banks<A NAME = "AS93465"></A><A NAME = "AB93466"></A> of the Nile.

that he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he remembered
<P>

that he had a home<A NAME = "AS935011"></A> in Bagdad<A NAME = "BB935016"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB935728"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, meaning<A NAME = "AS935019"></A> to return by way of Aleppo<A NAME = "AB935032"></A>,

and after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of
<P>

the Tigris.
<P>

<P>

But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with some
<P>

Persian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them
<P>

to their native land, and even as far as India<A NAME = "AS935621"></A><A NAME = "BB935622"></A><A HREF = "SPP359.HTM#BB1077018"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and so it came

magic<A NAME = "AO82493"></A><A NAME = "AS82494"></A><A NAME = "AS82495"></A><A NAME = "AB82496"></A> arts discovered that Aladdin<A NAME = "BB824915"></A><A HREF = "SPP275.HTM#BB82666"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, instead of perishing miserably
<P>

in the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom
<P>

he was living in great honour and wealth.  He knew that the poor
<P>

tailor's son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp,
<P>

and travelled night and day till he reached<A NAME = "AS825317"></A> the capital<A NAME = "BB825322"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF63146"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of China,
<P>

bent<A NAME = "AS82543"></A> on Aladdin's<A NAME = "AB82548"></A> ruin.  As he passed through the town he heard
<P>

people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Forgive my ignorance,&quot; he asked, &quot;what is this palace you 
speak of?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin's palace,&quot; was the reply,

<P>

&quot;the greatest wonder of the world?  I will direct you if you have
<P>

a mind to see it.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The magician thanked him who spoke, and having seen the palace knew
<P>

that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp, and became half
<P>

mad with rage.  He determined to get hold of the lamp, and again
<P>

plunge<A NAME = "AS82663"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB82666"></A><A HREF = "SPP275.HTM#BB82687"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> into the deepest poverty.
<P>

<P>

Unluckily, Aladdin<A NAME = "AO82685"></A><A NAME = "AS82686"></A><A NAME = "BB82687"></A><A HREF = "SPP276.HTM#BB828318"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave
<P>

the magician plenty of time.  He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them
<P>

into a basket, and went to the palace, crying:  &quot;New lamps for old!
&quot;
<P>

followed by a jeering crowd.
<P>

<P>

The princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, sent a
<P>

slave to find out what the noise was about, who came back laughing,
<P>

so that the princess scolded her.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Madam,&quot; replied the slave, &quot;who can help laughing to see an 
old
<P>

fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones?&quot;

into Persia<A NAME = "AS104095"></A><A NAME = "BB104096"></A><A HREF = "SPP349.HTM#BB1047618"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  And as the first step, she was to dress herself
<P>

with care<A NAME = "AO104105"></A>, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited
<P>

her next morning.
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO104135"></A> was transported with delight on learning the result
<P>

of the interview, and his opinion of the doctor's skill was raised
<P>

still higher when, on the following day, the princess behaved
<P>

towards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete
<P>

cure would not be long delayed.  However he contented himself with
<P>

assuring her how happy he was to see<A NAME = "AO1041817"></A><A NAME = "AS1041818"></A> her health<A NAME = "BB1041823"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF177914"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> so much improved,
<P>

and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician,
<P>

and to repose entire confidence in him.  Then he retired,
<P>

without awaiting any reply from the princess.
<P>

<P>

The Prince<A NAME = "AO104235"></A><A NAME = "AS104236"></A><A NAME = "BB104237"></A><A HREF = "SPP349.HTM#BB1047519"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Persia left the room at the same time, and asked
<P>

if he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the Princess
<P>

of Bengal<A NAME = "AO104255"></A><A NAME = "AS104256"></A><A NAME = "BB104257"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF101757"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had reached Cashmere, which was so far distant from her
<P>

father's kingdom, and how she came to be there alone.  The Sultan
<P>

thought the question very natural, and told him the same story
<P>

that the Princess of Bengal had done, adding that he had ordered
<P>

the enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity,
<P>

though he was quite ignorant how it could be used.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the physician, &quot;your Highness's tale has 
supplied me
<P>

with the clue I needed to complete the recovery of the princess. 
<P>

During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse, a portion of its
<P>

enchantment<A NAME = "AO104353"></A><A NAME = "AS104354"></A><A NAME = "AB104355"></A> has by some means been communicated to her person,
<P>

and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which I possess
<P>

the secret.  If your Highness<A NAME = "AO1043711"></A> will deign to consent, and to give

and this will be worth much more to you than what extra money you
<P>

might obtain from the merchants.&quot;  &quot;Bad old man,&quot; he 
exclaimed,
<P>

&quot;rather than sell my slave to you I would give her to a Jew.&quot; 

<P>

&quot;But, Noureddin,&quot; I remonstrated, &quot;you do not consider that 
in speaking
<P>

thus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed everything.&quot; 
<P>

This remonstrance<A NAME = "AO75045"></A><A NAME = "AS75046"></A><A NAME = "AB75047"></A> only irritated him the more.  Throwing himself on me
<P>

like a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his heart's content,

<P>

and left me in the state your Majesty sees.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So saying<A NAME = "AO75085"></A><A NAME = "AS75086"></A> Saouy turned aside his head and wept<A NAME = "BB750821"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF12585"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> bitterly.
<P>

<P>

The king's wrath was kindled against Noureddin.  He ordered the captain

<P>

of the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage Noureddin's house,
<P>

to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him. 

<P>

A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan's,
<P>

hearing this order given, slipped out of the king's apartment,
<P>

and hastened to warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the
<P>

beautiful Persian.  Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces,
<P>

he disappeared before Noureddin had time to thank him.
<P>

<P>

As soon, then, as the fair<A NAME = "AO751913"></A> Persian had put on her veil they
<P>

fled together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town
<P>

without being observed.  At the mouth of the Euphrates they
<P>

found<A NAME = "AS75223"></A> a ship just about to start for Bagdad<A NAME = "BB752220"></A><A HREF = "SPP251.HTM#BB753223"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  They embarked,
<P>

and immediately the anchor<A NAME = "AO75239"></A> was raised and they set sail.
<P>

<P>

When the captain<A NAME = "AO75257"></A><A NAME = "AS75258"></A><A NAME = "AS75259"></A><A NAME = "AB752510"></A> of the guard reached Noureddin's<A NAME = "AB752521"></A> house he caused his
<P>

soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force, but no trace was

<P>

to be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the neighbours give
<P>

any information about them.  When the king heard that they had escaped,

to the conclusion that the young man had been right, when he
<P>

had accused him of being a great chatter-box. However, we wished
<P>

to keep him with us, and share our feast, and we remained at table
<P>

till the hour of afternoon prayer.  Then the company broke up,
<P>

and I went back to work in my shop.
<P>

<P>

&quot;It was during this interval that the little hunchback, half drunk

<P>

already, presented himself before me, singing and playing on his drum. 

<P>

I took him home, to amuse mg wife, and she invited him to supper. 
<P>

While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in spite
<P>

of all we could do, he died shortly.  It was all so sudden that we
<P>

lost our heads, and in order to divert suspicion from ourselves,
<P>

we carried the body to the house of a Jewish physician.  He placed
<P>

it in the chamber of the purveyor, and the purveyor propped it up in
<P>

the street, where it was thought to have been killed by the merchant.
<P>

<P>

&quot;This, Sire, is the story which I was obliged to tell to satisfy
<P>

your highness.  It is now for you to say if we deserve mercy
<P>

or punishment; life or death?&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO55395"></A><A NAME = "AS55396"></A><A NAME = "AS55397"></A><A NAME = "BB55398"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF50087"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Kashgar listened with an air<A NAME = "AB553921"></A> of pleasure which filled
<P>

the tailor and his friends with hope.  &quot;I must confess,&quot; he 
exclaimed,
<P>

&quot;that I am much more interested in the stories of the barber and
<P>

his brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my own jester. 
<P>

But before I allow you all four to return to your own homes, and have
<P>

the corpse<A NAME = "AO55445"></A><A NAME = "AS55446"></A><A NAME = "AB55447"></A> of the hunchback properly buried, I should like to see
<P>

this barber<A NAME = "AO55455"></A> who has earned your pardon.  And as he is in this town,
<P>

let an usher go with you at once in search of him.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing with them an old man

<H2>Seventh and Last Voyage</H2>

<P>

<P>

After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go
<P>

to sea no more.  I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life,
<P>

and I had run risks enough.  I only wished to end my days in peace. 
<P>

One day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends,
<P>

I was told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me,
<P>

and when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of
<P>

Haroun al Raschid, which I accordingly did.  After I had saluted him,
<P>

the Caliph said:
<P>

<P>

&quot;I have sent for you, Sindbad<A NAME = "AS454414"></A><A NAME = "BB454415"></A><A HREF = "SPP152.HTM#BB45727"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, because I need your services. 
<P>

I have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib
<P>

in return for his message of friendship.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Caliph's<A NAME = "AO45485"></A><A NAME = "AS45486"></A><A NAME = "AS45487"></A><A NAME = "AB45488"></A> commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt<A NAME = "AB454823"></A>.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Commander of the Faithful,&quot; I answered, &quot;I am ready to do 
all that
<P>

your Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am
<P>

utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone. 
<P>

Indeed, I have made<A NAME = "AS45539"></A> a vow never again to leave Bagdad<A NAME = "BB455324"></A><A HREF = "SPP156.HTM#BB470126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.&quot;
<P>

<P>

With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures,

<P>

to which he listened patiently.
<P>

<P>

&quot;I admit,&quot; said he, &quot;that you have indeed had some 
extraordinary

fortune and a beautiful wife, my brother asked no more questions,
<P>

but concealing his purse, with the money the lady had given him,
<P>

in the folds of his dress, he set out joyfully with his guide.
<P>

<P>

They walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at a
<P>

large house, where she knocked.  The door was opened by a young
<P>

Greek<A NAME = "AO52253"></A><A NAME = "AS52254"></A><A NAME = "AB52255"></A><A HREF = "SPP176.HTM#BB528327"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> slave, and the old woman led my brother across a well-paved
<P>

court into a well-furnished hall.  Here she left him to inform
<P>

her mistress<A NAME = "AO52275"></A><A NAME = "AS52276"></A><A NAME = "AB52277"></A> of his presence, and as the day was hot he flung
<P>

himself on a pile<A NAME = "AO52289"></A> of cushions and took off his heavy turban. 
<P>

In a few<A NAME = "AO52297"></A> minutes there entered a lady, and my brother perceived at
<P>

the first glance that she was even more beautiful and more richly
<P>

dressed than he had expected.  He rose from his seat, but the lady
<P>

signed to him to sit down again and placed herself beside him. 
<P>

After the usual compliments had passed between them she said,
<P>

&quot;We are not comfortable here, let us go into another room,&quot;
<P>

and passing into a smaller chamber, apparently communicating
<P>

with no other, she continued to talk to him for some time. 
<P>

Then rising hastily she left him, saying, &quot;Stay where you are,
<P>

I will come back in a moment.&quot;
<P>

<P>

He waited as he was told, but instead of the lady there entered a huge
<P>

black slave with a sword in his hand.  Approaching my brother with
<P>

an angry countenance he exclaimed, &quot;What business have you here?&quot; 

<P>

His voice and manner were so terrific that Alnaschar had not strength
<P>

to reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from him, and even
<P>

sabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any resistance. 
<P>

As soon as he was let go, he sank on the ground powerless to move,
<P>

<p><ul><ul>   (5) HOMELESS SHELTER ALLOWANCE-- Under rules prescribed by the Secretary, a State<A NAME = "AO417429"></A> agency may develop a standard homeless 
shelter allowance, which shall not exceed $143 per month, for such expenses as may reasonably be expected to be incurred by households 
in which all members are homeless individuals but are not receiving free shelter throughout the month. A State<A NAME = "AO4174125"></A> agency that 
develops the allowance may use the allowance in determining eligibility and allotments for the households. The State<A NAME = "AO4174165"></A> agency may make a 
household with extremely low shelter costs ineligible for the allowance.</ul></ul>

 recurring medical<A NAME = "AB417859"></A> expenses that are initially verified under the excess medical<A NAME = "AB417878"></A> expense deduction in lieu of submitting 
information on, or verification of, actual expenses on a monthly basis.</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (ii) METHOD-- The method described in clause (i)
shall--</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (I) be designed<A NAME = "AO418013"></A> to
minimize the burden for the eligible elderly or disabled household member
choosing to deduct the recurrent medical expenses of the member pursuant to
the method;</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (II) rely on
reasonable estimates of the expected medical expenses of the member for the
certification period (including changes that can be reasonably anticipated
based on available information about the medical condition of the member,
public or private medical insurance coverage, and the current verified
medical expenses incurred by the member); and</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (III) not require further reporting or verification of a change in medical expenses if such a change has been anticipated for
 the certification period.</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>   (7) EXCESS SHELTER EXPENSE DEDUCTION--</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>   (A) IN GENERAL-- A household<A NAME = "AO418416"></A> shall be entitled, with respect to expenses other than expenses paid on behalf of the household 
by a third party, to an excess shelter expense deduction to the extent that the monthly<A NAME = "AO418482"></A> amount expended by a household for shelter
 exceeds an amount equal to 50 percent of monthly household income after all other applicable deductions have been allowed.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>   (B) MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DEDUCTION-- In the case of a household that does not contain an elderly or disabled individual, in the 
48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States, the excess 
shelter expense deduction shall not exceed--</ul></ul></ul>

month, respectively;</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (iii) for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, $275, $478, $393, $334, and $203 per month, respectively; and</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (i) IN GENERAL-- In computing the excess shelter expense deduction, a State<A NAME = "AO419131"></A><A NAME = "AS419132"></A> agency may use a standard utility<A NAME = "AB419145"></A> allowance in 
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, except that a State<A NAME = "AO419173"></A> agency may use an allowance that does not fluctuate within a
 year to reflect seasonal variations.</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (ii) RESTRICTIONS ON HEATING AND COOLING EXPENSES-- An allowance for a heating or cooling expense may not be used in the case
 of a household that--</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (I) does not incur a heating or cooling expense, as the case may be;</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (II) does incur<A NAME = "AO419413"></A> a heating or cooling expense but is located in a public housing unit that has central utility meters and 
charges households, with regard to the expense, only for excess utility costs; or</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (III) shares the expense with, and lives with, another individual not participating in the food stamp program, another 
household participating in the food stamp program, or both, unless the allowance<A NAME = "AO419568"></A> is prorated between the household and the other 
individual, household, or both.</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p><ttitle>   (aa) the State<A NAME = "AO41989"></A> agency has developed 1 or more standards that include the cost of heating and cooling and 1 or more standards 
that do not include the cost of heating and cooling; and</ttitle>
<p><ttitle>   (bb) the Secretary finds that the standards will not result in
an increased cost to the Secretary.</ttitle>
<p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul>   (II)
HOUSEHOLD ELECTION-- A State<A NAME = "AO420018"></A><A NAME = "AS420019"></A><A NAME = "AS420020"></A><A NAME = "AS420021"></A><A NAME = "AS420022"></A> agency that has not made the use of a standard

is not absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed. 
<P>

And whatever defects her body may have, pleasant ways and good
<P>

behaviour will go far to remedy them.
<P>

<P>

The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been brought
<P>

to my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find
<P>

that I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been
<P>

given me of her beauty.  I began my married life in high spirits,
<P>

and the best hopes of happiness.
<P>

<P>

The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did
<P>

not appear, I ordered a servant to call her.  Still she did not come,
<P>

and I waited impatiently for some time.  At last she entered the room,
<P>

and she took<A NAME = "AO89527"></A><A NAME = "AS89528"></A> our places at the table, and plates of rice<A NAME = "BB895227"></A><A HREF = "SPP299.HTM#BB897026"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> were set
<P>

before us.
<P>

<P>

I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my surprise
<P>

to notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from her
<P>

pocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin, and by
<P>

the help of this pin conveyed her rice<A NAME = "AS895817"></A><A NAME = "AS895818"></A><A NAME = "AB895819"></A> grain by grain<A NAME = "AB895826"></A> to her mouth.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Amina,&quot; I exclaimed in astonishment, &quot;is that the way you 
eat rice
<P>

at home?  And did you do it because your appetite was so small,
<P>

or did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eat
<P>

more than a certain number?  If it was from economy, and you are
<P>

anxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm. 
<P>

We shall never ruin ourselves in that way!  Our fortune is large
<P>

enough for all our needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek to
<P>

check yourself, but eat as much as you desire, as I do!&quot;

I trust that you may be spared to me for many years.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I hope,&quot; answered he, &quot;that your life may be long, but as 
for me,
<P>

all is finished.  I have set my house in order, and to-day I shall
<P>

be buried with my wife.  This has been the law upon our island
<P>

from the earliest ages--the living husband goes to the grave
<P>

with his dead wife, the living wife with her dead husband. 
<P>

So did our fathers, and so must we do.  The law changes not,
<P>

and all must submit to it!&quot;
<P>

<P>

As he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began
<P>

to assemble.  The body, decked in rich robes and sparkling
<P>

with jewels, was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started,
<P>

taking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city,
<P>

the wretched husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle,
<P>

following mournfully.
<P>

<P>

When the place<A NAME = "AO40067"></A><A NAME = "AS40068"></A> of interment<A NAME = "AB400613"></A> was reached the corpse was lowered,
<P>

just as it was, into a deep pit.  Then the husband, bidding farewell
<P>

to all his friends, stretched himself upon another bier, upon which
<P>

were laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and he
<P>

also was let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern,
<P>

and then a stone<A NAME = "AO40119"></A> was laid over the opening, and the melancholy
<P>

company wended its way back to the city.
<P>

<P>

You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings;
<P>

to all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomed
<P>

from their youth up; but I was so horrified that I could not help
<P>

telling the king how it struck me.

A small door opened straight into the garden, and the first object
<P>

that met the Sultan's eyes was the Golden Water.
<P>

<P>

&quot;What lovely coloured water!&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;where is the 
spring,
<P>

and how do you make the fountain rise so high?  I do not believe there
<P>

is anything like it in the world.&quot;  He went forward to examine it,

<P>

and when he had satisfied his curiosity, the princess conducted him
<P>

towards the Singing Tree.
<P>

<P>

As they drew near, the Sultan<A NAME = "AO1143813"></A> was startled by the sound of
<P>

strange voices, but could see nothing.  &quot;Where have you hidden
<P>

your musicians?&quot; he asked the princess; &quot;are they up in the air,

<P>

or under the earth?  Surely the owners of such charming voices
<P>

ought not to conceal themselves!&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; answered the princess, &quot;the voices all come from the 
tree
<P>

which is straight in front of us; and if you will deign to advance
<P>

a few steps, you will see that they become clearer.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan did as he was told, and was so wrapt in delight
<P>

at what he heard that he stood some time in silence.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Tell me, madam, I pray you,&quot; he said at last, &quot;how this

<P>

marvellous<A NAME = "AO114523"></A><A NAME = "AS114524"></A><A NAME = "AB114525"></A> tree came into your garden?  It must have been brought
<P>

from a great distance, or else, fond as I am of all curiosities,
<P>

I could not have missed hearing of it!  What is its name?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;The only name it has, sire,&quot; replied she, &quot;is the Singing 
Tree,
<P>

and it is not a native of this country.  Its history is mixed up with
<P>

those of the Golden Water and the Talking Bird, which you have not

to look into his accounts with his steward, sending him away every
<P>

time he appeared with his book.
<P>

<P>

&quot;See only that I live well,&quot; he said, &quot;and do not disturb me 
about
<P>

anything else.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Not only did Noureddin's friends constantly partake of his hospitality,

<P>

but in every way they took advantage of his generosity; everything of
<P>

his that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or any
<P>

other source of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them. 
<P>

In vain the Persian protested against the wrong he did himself;
<P>

he continued to scatter with the same lavish hand.
<P>

<P>

Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse himself,
<P>

and dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire. 
<P>

The year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table,
<P>

there came a knock at the door.  The slaves having been sent away,
<P>

Noureddin went to open it himself.  One of his friends had risen at
<P>

the same time, but Noureddin was before him, and finding the intruder
<P>

to be the steward, he went out and closed the door.  The friend,
<P>

curious to hear what passed between them, hid himself behind the hangings,

<P>

and heard the following words:
<P>

<P>

&quot;My lord,&quot; said the steward, &quot;I beg a thousand pardons for

<P>

interrupting you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place. 
<P>

Nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all
<P>

other<A NAME = "AO73753"></A><A NAME = "AS73754"></A> sources of income<A NAME = "AB737511"></A> are also at end, having been transferred
<P>

by you to others.  If you wish me to remain in your service,
<P>

furnish me with the necessary funds, else I must withdraw.&quot;

Once home he said to the genie:  &quot;Build me a palace of the
<P>

finest marble<A NAME = "AS81905"></A><A NAME = "AS81906"></A><A NAME = "BB81907"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF119210"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, set with jasper<A NAME = "BB819014"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF207121"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, agate, and other precious stones. 
<P>

In the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four
<P>

walls<A NAME = "AS81923"></A><A NAME = "AS81924"></A> of massy<A NAME = "AB81929"></A> gold and silver<A NAME = "BB819216"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF120018"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, each side having six windows,
<P>

whose lattices, all except one, which is to be left unfinished,
<P>

must be set with diamonds and rubies.  There must be stables and
<P>

horses<A NAME = "AO81953"></A><A NAME = "AS81954"></A><A NAME = "BB81955"></A><A HREF = "SPP296.HTM#BB888825"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The palace<A NAME = "AO81975"></A> was finished by next day, and the genie carried him
<P>

there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out,
<P>

even to the laying<A NAME = "AS81999"></A><A NAME = "AS819910"></A> of a velvet<A NAME = "AB819917"></A> carpet from Aladdin's<A NAME = "AB819924"></A><A HREF = "SPP273.HTM#BB820612"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> palace to the
<P>

Sultan's. Aladdin's<A NAME = "AS82005"></A><A NAME = "BB82006"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF791520"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked
<P>

to the palace with her slaves, while he followed her on horseback. 
<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO82025"></A> sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them,
<P>

so that the air<A NAME = "AO82039"></A> resounded with music and cheers.  She was taken
<P>

to the princess, who saluted her and treated her with great honour. 
<P>

At night the princess said good-bye to her father, and set out
<P>

on the carpet<A NAME = "AS82067"></A> for Aladdin's<A NAME = "BB820612"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF819924"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> palace, with his mother at her side,
<P>

and followed by the hundred slaves.  She was charmed at the sight
<P>

of Aladdin<A NAME = "AS82085"></A><A NAME = "BB82086"></A><A HREF = "SPP273.HTM#BB821423"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, who ran to receive her.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Princess,&quot; he said, &quot;blame your beauty for my boldness if I 
have
<P>

displeased you.&quot;
<P>

<P>

She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father
<P>

in this matter.  After the wedding<A NAME = "AO821413"></A><A NAME = "AS821414"></A> had taken place Aladdin<A NAME = "BB821423"></A><A HREF = "SPP273.HTM#BB82189"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> led her
<P>

into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped with him,
<P>

after which they danced till midnight.
<P>

<P>

Next<A NAME = "AO82183"></A><A NAME = "AS82184"></A> day Aladdin<A NAME = "BB82189"></A><A HREF = "SPP274.HTM#BB822517"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> invited the Sultan to see the palace.  On entering

At night<A NAME = "AO66595"></A><A NAME = "AS66596"></A> the whole town was filled with rejoicings<A NAME = "BB665921"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF561417"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and with much pomp
<P>

the Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the king's daughter)
<P>

was conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura.

<P>

Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first

to do was at once to take her into her confidence.
<P>

<P>

Accordingly, as soon as they were alone she took Haiatelnefous

by the hand and said:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myself

on your mercy.  I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess

then I am sure you will forgive my imposture, in consideration

Haroun<A NAME = "AO95993"></A>-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the child,
<P>

who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself was
<P>

to hear on the morrow.  &quot;Is there any other verdict possible?&quot;

<P>

he asked the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself. 
<P>

&quot;I can imagine no better judgment.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;If the circumstances are really such as we have heard,&quot;
<P>

replied the grand-vizir, &quot;it seems to me your Highness could
<P>

only follow the example of this boy, in the method of reasoning,
<P>

and also in your conclusions.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Then take careful note of this house,&quot; said the Caliph, &quot;and
bring me
<P>

the boy to-morrow, so that the affair may be tried by him in my presence. 

<P>

Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty from the mouth of a child. 
<P>

Bid<A NAME = "AO96133"></A><A NAME = "AS96134"></A><A NAME = "AS96135"></A><A NAME = "AB96136"></A> Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives<A NAME = "BB961321"></A><A HREF = "SPP320.HTM#BB96147"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and see that two dealers
<P>

in olives<A NAME = "AO96145"></A><A NAME = "AS96146"></A><A NAME = "BB96147"></A><A HREF = "SPP321.HTM#BB965023"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are present.&quot;  So saying<A NAME = "AO961418"></A> the Caliph returned to the palace.

<P>

<P>

The next morning early, the grand-vizir went back to the house
<P>

where they had seen the children playing, and asked for the mistress
<P>

and her children.  Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir inquired
<P>

which had represented the Cadi in their game of the previous evening. 
<P>

The eldest and tallest, changing colour, confessed that it was he,
<P>

and to his mother's great alarm, the grand-vizir said that he had
<P>

strict orders to bring him into the presence of the Caliph.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Does he want to take my son from me?&quot; cried the poor woman;
<P>

but the grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her that she
<P>

should have the boy again in an hour, and she would be quite
<P>

satisfied when she knew the reason of the summons.  So she dressed
<P>

the boy<A NAME = "AO96285"></A> in his best clothes, and the two left the house.

lip<A NAME = "AO36893"></A><A NAME = "AS36894"></A> hung down upon his chest, and he had ears like elephant's<A NAME = "AB368927"></A> ears,
<P>

which covered his shoulders, and nails like the claws of some
<P>

fierce bird.
<P>

<P>

At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men. 
<P>

When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us attentively

<P>

with his fearful eye.  Presently when he had looked at us enough he
<P>

came towards us, and stretching out his hand took me by the back
<P>

of the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I was
<P>

mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next,
<P>

whom he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain,
<P>

and finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up in one hand
<P>

and stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fire
<P>

at which he presently roasted him.  After the giant had supped he
<P>

lay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while we lay
<P>

shivering with horror the whole night through, and when day broke
<P>

he awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle.
<P>

<P>

When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning our
<P>

horrible fate<A NAME = "AO37085"></A>, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries. 
<P>

Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us to
<P>

kill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even if we
<P>

had thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves. 
<P>

So at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wandering
<P>

up and down the island eating such fruits as we could find,
<P>

and when night came we returned to the castle, having sought in vain
<P>

for any other place of shelter.  At sunset the giant returned,
<P>

supped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored till dawn,
<P>

and then left us as before.  Our condition seemed to us so frightful
<P>

that several of my companions thought it would be better to leap

them they rubbed it into his wounds, thus giving him acute agony,
<P>

though he had the presence of mind to give no sign of life. 
<P>

They then left him, and their place was taken by the old woman,
<P>

who dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down into a vault filled
<P>

with the bodies of murdered men.
<P>

<P>

At first the violence of his fall caused him to lose consciousness,
<P>

but luckily the salt<A NAME = "AO52569"></A><A NAME = "AS525610"></A><A NAME = "AB525611"></A> which had been rubbed into his wounds had by
<P>

its smarting preserved his life, and little by little he regained
<P>

his strength.  At the end of two days he lifted the trapdoor
<P>

during the night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak,
<P>

when he saw the old woman leave the house in search of more prey. 
<P>

Luckily she did not observe him, and when she was out of sight he
<P>

stole from this nest of assassins and took refuge in my house.
<P>

<P>

I dressed his wounds and tended him carefully, and when a month
<P>

had passed he was as well as ever.  His one thought was how to
<P>

be revenged on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose he had
<P>

a purse<A NAME = "AO52675"></A><A NAME = "AS52676"></A> made large enough to contain five hundred gold<A NAME = "AB526723"></A><A HREF = "SPP232.HTM#BB698021"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pieces,
<P>

but filled it instead with bits of glass.  This he tied round
<P>

him with his sash, and, disguising himself as an old woman,
<P>

he took a sabre, which he hid under his dress.
<P>

<P>

One morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met his
<P>

old enemy prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy. 
<P>

He went up to her and, imitating the voice of a woman, he said,
<P>

&quot;Do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me? 
<P>

themselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes. 
<P>

But the princess, while thanking them for their politeness,
<P>

explained that she wished for no company but that of her brothers,
<P>

and that the rest were free to go where they would.
<P>

<P>

So saying the princess mounted her horse, and, declining to allow
<P>

even Prince Bahman to carry the cage with the Talking Bird,
<P>

she entrusted him with the branch of the Singing Tree, while Prince
<P>

Perviz<A NAME = "AO111673"></A><A NAME = "AS111674"></A><A NAME = "AS111675"></A> took care of the flask<A NAME = "AB1116716"></A> containing the Golden<A NAME = "BB1116723"></A><A HREF = "SPP382.HTM#BB1146623"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Water.
<P>

<P>

Then they rode away, followed by the knights and gentlemen,
<P>

who begged to be permitted to escort them.
<P>

<P>

It had been the intention<A NAME = "AO1117211"></A> of the party to stop and tell their
<P>

adventures to the dervish, but they found to their sorrow that he
<P>

was dead, whether from old age, or whether from the feeling
<P>

that his task was done, they never knew.
<P>

<P>

As they continued their road their numbers grew daily smaller,
<P>

for the knights<A NAME = "AO111787"></A> turned off one by one to their own homes, and only
<P>

the brothers<A NAME = "AO111795"></A><A NAME = "AS111796"></A> and sister finally drew up at the gate<A NAME = "BB1117923"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF182623"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of the palace.
<P>

<P>

The princess carried the cage straight into the garden, and, as soon
<P>

as the bird began to sing, nightingales, larks, thrushes, finches,
<P>

and all sorts<A NAME = "AO111837"></A> of other birds mingled their voices in chorus. 
<P>

The branch she planted in a corner near the house, and in a few
<P>

days it had grown into a great tree.  As for the Golden Water it
<P>

was poured<A NAME = "AO111865"></A><A NAME = "AS111866"></A> into a great marble<A NAME = "AB1118615"></A> basin specially prepared for it,
<P>

and it swelled and bubbled and then shot up into the air in a fountain
<P>

twenty feet high.

accomplished as yourself.  Instead, therefore, of returning to your
<P>

own country, take my daughter and my crown and stay with us. 
<P>

I shall feel that I have a worthy successor, and shall cheerfully
<P>

retire from the fatigues of government.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The king's<A NAME = "AO66345"></A> offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the Princess
<P>

Badoura.  She felt that it was equally impossible to confess that she
<P>

had deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his heart;

<P>

a refusal<A NAME = "AO66375"></A> which might turn all his kindness to hatred and persecution.
<P>

<P>

All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few moments
<P>

silence said with a blush, which the king attributed to modesty:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinion
<P>

your Majesty<A NAME = "AO66435"></A> has expressed for my person and of the honour
<P>

you do me, that, though I am quite unworthy of it,
<P>

I dare not refuse.  But, sire, I can only accept such
<P>

an alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with your counsels.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for the
<P>

following<A NAME = "AO66493"></A> day, and the princess employed the intervening time in
<P>

informing the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring them

<P>

that the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage. 
<P>

She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret well.

<P>

time in assembling his court and council, to whom he presented
<P>

his successor, and placing his future son-in-law on the throne
<P>

made everyone do homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new king.

<P>

Balsora<A NAME = "AO70823"></A><A NAME = "AS70824"></A> was the capital<A NAME = "AB708211"></A> of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph. 
<P>

During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of Balsora,
<P>

who was his cousin, was called Zinebi.  Not thinking one vizir enough
<P>

for the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacan
<P>

and Saouy.
<P>

<P>

Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasure
<P>

in obliging, as far as in him lay, those who had business with him. 
<P>

Throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem
<P>

and praise him as he deserved.
<P>

<P>

Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone with
<P>

whom he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite of his
<P>

great riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the necessaries
<P>

of life.  What made him particularly detested was the great aversion
<P>

he had to Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king.
<P>

<P>

One day, while the king amused himself talking with his two
<P>

vizirs and other members of the council, the conversation turned
<P>

on female slaves.  While some declared that it sufficed for a
<P>

slave to be beautiful, others, and Khacan was among the number,
<P>

maintained that beauty alone was not enough, but that it must
<P>

be accompanied by wit, wisdom, modesty, and, if possible, knowledge.
<P>

<P>

The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but charged
<P>

Khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions. 
<P>

Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of the

Aladdin<A NAME = "AS83993"></A><A NAME = "BB83994"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB841018"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had given her in her cup.  When he returned she asked him
<P>

to drink<A NAME = "AS84005"></A><A NAME = "AS84006"></A> her health<A NAME = "BB840011"></A><A HREF = "SPP281.HTM#BB844121"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in the wine<A NAME = "AB840018"></A> of Africa, handing him her cup
<P>

in exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him.
<P>

<P>

Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty,

<P>

but the princess cut him short saying:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Let me drink first, and you shall say what you will afterwards.&quot; 

<P>

She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician
<P>

drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless.
<P>

<P>

The princess<A NAME = "AS84105"></A> then opened the door to Aladdin<A NAME = "BB841018"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB84208"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and flung her arms
<P>

round his neck, but Aladdin<A NAME = "AS841111"></A><A NAME = "AB841112"></A> put her away, bidding her to leave him,
<P>

as he had more to do.  He then went to the dead magician, took the
<P>

lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all
<P>

in it back to China<A NAME = "AS841411"></A><A NAME = "BB841412"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB842724"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  This was done, and the princess in her chamber
<P>

only felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at home again.
<P>

<P>

The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for his
<P>

lost<A NAME = "AO84183"></A> daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes,
<P>

for there stood the palace as before!  He hastened thither,
<P>

and Aladdin<A NAME = "AO84205"></A><A NAME = "AS84206"></A><A NAME = "AS84207"></A><A NAME = "BB84208"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB842116"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> received him in the hall<A NAME = "AB842019"></A> of the four-and-twenty windows,
<P>

with the princess at his side.  Aladdin<A NAME = "AS842115"></A><A NAME = "BB842116"></A><A HREF = "SPP280.HTM#BB842326"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> told him what had happened,
<P>

and showed him the dead body of the magician, that he might believe. 
<P>

A ten days' feast was proclaimed, and it seemed as if Aladdin<A NAME = "AS842325"></A><A NAME = "BB842326"></A><A HREF = "SPP281.HTM#BB84346"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

might now live the rest of his life in peace; but it was not to be.
<P>

<P>

The African<A NAME = "AO84265"></A> magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible,
<P>

more wicked and more cunning than himself.  He travelled<A NAME = "AS842719"></A> to China<A NAME = "BB842724"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF56"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

to avenge his brother's death, and went to visit a pious woman

and while Prince<A NAME = "AO113997"></A> Bahman remained by the side of the Sultan,
<P>

Prince<A NAME = "AO114003"></A> Perviz rode on to warn his sister of their approach.
<P>

<P>

The moment<A NAME = "AO114025"></A> his Highness entered the courtyard, the princess flung
<P>

herself at his feet, but he bent and raised her, and gazed at her
<P>

for some time, struck with her grace and beauty, and also with the
<P>

indefinable<A NAME = "AO114053"></A><A NAME = "AS114054"></A> air<A NAME = "AB114057"></A> of courts that seemed to hang round this country girl. 

<P>

&quot;They are all worthy one of the other,&quot; he said to himself,
<P>

&quot;and I am not surprised that they think so much of her opinions. 
<P>

I must know more of them.&quot;
<P>

<P>

By this time the princess had recovered from the first embarrassment
<P>

of meeting, and proceeded to make her speech of welcome.
<P>

<P>

&quot;This is only a simple country house, sire,&quot; she said,
<P>

&quot;suitable to people like ourselves, who live a quiet life. 
<P>

It cannot compare with the great city mansions, much less,
<P>

of course, with the smallest of the Sultan's palaces.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I cannot quite agree with you,&quot; he replied; &quot;even the little

<P>

that I have seen I admire greatly, and I will reserve my judgment
<P>

until you have shown me the whole.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The princess<A NAME = "AO114225"></A> then led the way from room to room, and the Sultan examined

<P>

everything carefully.  &quot;Do you call this a simple country house?&quot;

<P>

he said at last.  &quot;Why, if every country house was like this,
<P>

the towns would soon be deserted.  I am no longer astonished
<P>

that you do not wish to leave it.  Let us go into the gardens,
<P>

which I am sure are no less beautiful than the rooms.&quot;

<H2>Third Voyage</H2>

<P>

<P>

After a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me quite
<P>

forget the perils of my two voyages.  Moreover, as I was still
<P>

in the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing. 
<P>

So once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest
<P>

merchandise<A NAME = "AO36403"></A><A NAME = "AS36404"></A><A NAME = "AB36405"></A> of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail
<P>

with other merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands. 
<P>

We had touched at many ports and made much profit, when one day
<P>

upon the open sea we were caught by a terrible wind which blew
<P>

us completely out of our reckoning, and lasting for several days
<P>

finally drove us into harbour on a strange island.
<P>

<P>

&quot;I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here,&quot;
<P>

quoth our captain.  &quot;This island and all adjoining it are inhabited by

<P>

hairy savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these dwarfs may

<P>

do we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts, and if one of them

<P>

is killed the rest will fall upon us, and speedily make an end of us.&quot;

<P>

<P>

These words<A NAME = "AO36535"></A><A NAME = "AS36536"></A> caused great consternation among all the ship's<A NAME = "AB365321"></A> company,
<P>

and only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly. 
<P>

There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages, not more than
<P>

two<A NAME = "AO36563"></A> feet high and covered with reddish fur.  Throwing themselves
<P>

into the waves they surrounded our vessel.  Chattering meanwhile
<P>

in a language we could not understand, and clutching at ropes
<P>

and gave him grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself
<P>

daily in his audience chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused
<P>

myself in seeing all that was most worthy of attention in the city. 
<P>

The island of Serendib being situated on the equinoctial line,
<P>

the days and nights there are of equal length.  The chief city
<P>

is placed at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by the highest
<P>

mountain in the world, which is in the middle of the island. 
<P>

I had the curiosity to ascend to its very summit, for this was the
<P>

place<A NAME = "AO44473"></A> to which Adam was banished out of Paradise.  Here are found
<P>

rubies<A NAME = "AO44483"></A><A NAME = "AS44484"></A><A NAME = "BB44485"></A><A HREF = "SPP148.HTM#BB44657"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and many precious things, and rare plants grow abundantly,
<P>

with cedar trees and cocoa palms.  On the seashore and at the mouths
<P>

of the rivers<A NAME = "AO44507"></A><A NAME = "AS44508"></A> the divers seek for pearls<A NAME = "BB445019"></A><A HREF = "SPP365.HTM#BB1097113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and in some valleys
<P>

diamonds<A NAME = "AO44513"></A><A NAME = "AS44514"></A><A NAME = "BB44515"></A><A HREF = "SPP169.HTM#BB508215"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are plentiful.  After many days I petitioned the king that I
<P>

might return to my own country, to which he graciously consented. 
<P>

Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when I went to take
<P>

leave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a letter to
<P>

the Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, &quot;I pray

<P>

you give these to the Caliph<A NAME = "AO445613"></A><A NAME = "AS445614"></A><A NAME = "AB445615"></A><A HREF = "SPP148.HTM#BB446613"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Haroun al Raschid, and assure him of
<P>

my friendship.&quot;
<P>

<P>

I accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked upon
<P>

the vessel which the king himself had chosen for me.  The king's
<P>

letter<A NAME = "AO44613"></A> was written in blue characters upon a rare and precious
<P>

skin of yellowish colour, and these were the words of it: 
<P>

&quot;The King<A NAME = "AS44636"></A><A NAME = "AB44637"></A> of the Indies, before whom walk a thousand elephants,
<P>

who lives in a palace, of which the roof blazes with a hundred
<P>

thousand<A NAME = "AO44653"></A><A NAME = "AS44654"></A> rubies<A NAME = "BB44657"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF409322"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and whose treasure house contains twenty thousand
<P>

diamond crowns, to the Caliph<A NAME = "AO446611"></A><A NAME = "AS446612"></A><A NAME = "BB446613"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF445615"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Haroun al Raschid sends greeting. 
<P>

Though the offering we present to you is unworthy of your notice,
<P>

we pray you to accept it as a mark of the esteem and friendship
<P>

<p><h3>SEC. 400. STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE AND IMMIGRATION.</h3>
<p><ul>  The Congress<A NAME = "AO30315"></A><A NAME = "AS30316"></A> makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare and immigration<A NAME = "AB303133"></A>:</ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (1) Self<A NAME = "AO30328"></A><A NAME = "AS30329"></A><A NAME = "AS303210"></A>-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United<A NAME = "AB303227"></A> States immigration law since this country's earliest immigration<A NAME = "AB303244"></A> 
statutes.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that--</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (A) aliens<A NAME = "AO30349"></A> within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own 
capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul>  (B) the availability<A NAME = "AO303511"></A><A NAME = "AS303512"></A> of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration<A NAME = "AB303531"></A> to the United States.</ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens<A NAME = "AO303620"></A><A NAME = "AS303621"></A> have been applying for and receiving public<A NAME = "AB303636"></A> benefits from Federal, State
, and local governments at increasing rates.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (4) Current<A NAME = "AO30378"></A><A NAME = "AS30379"></A><A NAME = "AS303710"></A><A NAME = "AS303711"></A><A NAME = "AB303712"></A> eligibility rules for public<A NAME = "AB303721"></A> assistance and unenforceable financial<A NAME = "AB303730"></A> support agreements have proved wholly 
incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure 
that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (6) It is a compelling<A NAME = "AO303914"></A><A NAME = "AS303915"></A><A NAME = "AS303916"></A><A NAME = "AS303917"></A> government<A NAME = "AB303920"></A> interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration<A NAME = "AB303937"></A> provided by the availability of 
public<A NAME = "AB303951"></A> benefits.</ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul>  (7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public 
benefits in this title, a State<A NAME = "AO304053"></A><A NAME = "AS304054"></A><A NAME = "AS304055"></A><A NAME = "AS304056"></A><A NAME = "AS304057"></A><A NAME = "AS304058"></A> that chooses to follow the Federal<A NAME = "AB304071"></A> classification in determining the eligibility<A NAME = "AB304082"></A> of such aliens for 
public<A NAME = "AB304094"></A> assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental<A NAME = "AB3040129"></A> 
interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration<A NAME = "AB3040157"></A> policy.</ul></ul>

from an incision<A NAME = "AO35997"></A> made high up in the tree into a vessel hung there
<P>

to receive it, and soon hardens into the substance called camphor,
<P>

but the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so treated.
<P>

<P>

In this same island we saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is smaller
<P>

than the elephant<A NAME = "AS36047"></A><A NAME = "AS36048"></A><A NAME = "AB36049"></A><A HREF = "SPP153.HTM#BB460613"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and larger than the buffalo<A NAME = "AB360420"></A>.  It has one horn
<P>

about a cubit long which is solid, but has a furrow from the base
<P>

to the tip.  Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man. 
<P>

The rhinoceros fights with the elephant, and transfixing him
<P>

with his horn carries him off upon his head, but becoming blinded
<P>

with the blood of his enemy, he falls helpless to the ground,
<P>

and then comes the roc, and clutches them both up in his talons
<P>

and takes them to feed his young.  This doubtless astonishes you,
<P>

but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself. 
<P>

For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful
<P>

things which we saw in this island.  Before we left I exchanged
<P>

one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited
<P>

greatly on our homeward way.  At last we reached Balsora, whence I
<P>

hastened<A NAME = "AS36173"></A> to Bagdad<A NAME = "BB36178"></A><A HREF = "SPP128.HTM#BB384228"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, where my first action was to bestow large sums
<P>

of money upon the poor, after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly
<P>

the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain.
<P>

<P>

Having thus related the adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad<A NAME = "AS362121"></A><A NAME = "BB362122"></A><A HREF = "SPP127.HTM#BB383113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> again
<P>

bestowed a hundred sequins upon Hindbad, inviting him to come again
<P>

on the following day and hear how he fared upon his third voyage. 
<P>

The other<A NAME = "AO36245"></A> guests also departed to their homes, but all returned at
<P>

the same hour next day, including the porter, whose former life of hard

<P>

work<A NAME = "AO36263"></A> and poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream. 
<P>

Again after the feast was over did Sindbad<A NAME = "AS362717"></A><A NAME = "AB362718"></A> claim the attention
<P>

of his guests and began the account of his third voyage.

recognised too late that he had confided in false friends,
<P>

who abandoned him in his hour of need.  Overwhelmed with grief,
<P>

he sought consolation from the beautiful Persian.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Alas, my lord,&quot; she said, &quot;at last you are convinced of the 
truth
<P>

of what I foretold.  There is now no other resource left but to sell
<P>

your slaves and your furniture.&quot;
<P>

<P>

First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the proceeds,

<P>

after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was valuable it
<P>

sufficed for some time.  Finally this resource also came to an end,
<P>

and again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian.
<P>

<P>

&quot;My lord,&quot; she said, &quot;I know that the late vizir, your 
father,
<P>

bought me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminished
<P>

in value since, I should still fetch a large sum.  Do not therefore
<P>

hesitate to sell me, and with the money you obtain go and establish
<P>

yourself in business in some distant town.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Charming Persian,&quot; answered Noureddin, &quot;how could I be 
guilty
<P>

of such baseness?  I would die rather than part from you whom
<P>

I love better than my life.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;My lord,&quot; she replied, &quot;I am well aware of your love for me,

<P>

which is only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessity
<P>

obliges us to seek the only remedy.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words, yielded,
<P>

and reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing her
<P>

to a dealer<A NAME = "AO74387"></A><A NAME = "AS74388"></A> named Hagi<A NAME = "AB743813"></A><A HREF = "SPP248.HTM#BB74645"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Hassan, he inquired her value.

In reply to my affectionate words, I expected a cheerful answer;
<P>

yet Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her rice<A NAME = "AS897025"></A><A NAME = "BB897026"></A><A HREF = "SPP301.HTM#BB905021"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

as before, only at longer and longer intervals.  And, instead of
<P>

trying the other dishes, all she did was to put every now and then
<P>

a crumb, of bread into her mouth, that would not have made a meal
<P>

for a sparrow.
<P>

<P>

I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse her to myself
<P>

as far as I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never been
<P>

used to eat in the company of men, and that her family might have
<P>

taught her that she ought to behave prudently and discreetly
<P>

in the presence of her husband.  Likewise that she might either
<P>

have dined already or intend to do so in her own apartments. 
<P>

So I took no further notice, and when I had finished left the room,
<P>

secretly much vexed at her strange conduct.
<P>

<P>

The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day,
<P>

whenever we ate together.  It was quite clear that no woman could
<P>

live<A NAME = "AS89873"></A> upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains<A NAME = "AB898724"></A><A HREF = "SPP301.HTM#BB90454"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of rice,
<P>

and I determined to find out how and when she got food.  I pretended
<P>

not to pay attention to anything she did, in the hope that little
<P>

by little she would get accustomed to me, and become more friendly;
<P>

but I soon saw that my expectations were quite vain.
<P>

<P>

One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and to, all appearance
<P>

sound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself without
<P>

making the slightest sound.  I could not imagine what she was going
<P>

to do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her. 
<P>

When she was fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room.
<P>

<P>

It was of no use:  she felt broad awake, and when her women entered
<P>

the room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted,
<P>

and what they thought of him.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Madame,&quot; they replied, &quot;it is of course impossible for us to
tell
<P>

what impression this young man has made on you.  For ourselves,
<P>

we think you would be fortunate if the king your father should
<P>

allow you to marry anyone so amiable.  Certainly there is no one
<P>

in the Court of Bengal who can be compared with him.&quot;
<P>

<P>

These flattering observations were by no means displeasing to
<P>

the princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she
<P>

merely said, &quot;You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to bed,
<P>

and let me sleep.&quot;
<P>

<P>

When she dressed the following morning, her maids noticed that,
<P>

contrary to her usual habit, the princess was very particular about
<P>

her toilette<A NAME = "AO99165"></A><A NAME = "AS99166"></A><A NAME = "AB99167"></A>, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three
<P>

times over.  &quot;For,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;if my appearance 
was not
<P>

displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was,
<P>

how much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all
<P>

my charms.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamonds
<P>

she could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all of
<P>

precious stones.  And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the
<P>

richest stuff<A NAME = "AS99255"></A> in all the Indies<A NAME = "AB992514"></A>, that no one was allowed to wear except

<P>

members of the royal family.  When she was fully dressed according
<P>

to her wishes, she sent<A NAME = "AS992711"></A> to know if the Prince<A NAME = "AB992722"></A><A HREF = "SPP334.HTM#BB100388"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Persia was awake
<P>

and ready to receive her, as she desired to present herself before him.

time<A NAME = "AO109493"></A><A NAME = "AS109494"></A> in the greatest anxiety, and consulted the magic<A NAME = "AB1094921"></A> knife,
<P>

not once but many times a day.  Hitherto the blade had remained
<P>

bright and spotless, but on the fatal hour on which Prince Bahman
<P>

and his horse were changed into black stones, large drops of blood
<P>

appeared on the surface.  &quot;Ah! my beloved brother,&quot; cried the 
princess
<P>

in horror, throwing the knife from her, &quot;I shall never see you again,

<P>

and it is I who have killed you.  Fool that I was to listen to the
<P>

voice<A NAME = "AO109563"></A><A NAME = "AS109564"></A><A NAME = "AB109565"></A> of that temptress, who probably was not speaking the truth. 
<P>

What are the Talking Bird and the Singing Tree to me in comparison
<P>

with you, passionately though I long for them!&quot;
<P>

<P>

Prince Perviz's grief at his brother's loss was not less than that of
<P>

Princess Parizade, but he did not waste his time on useless lamentations.

<P>

<P>

&quot;My sister,&quot; he said, &quot;why should you think the old woman was
deceiving
<P>

you about these treasures, and what would have been her object in
<P>

doing so!  No, no, our brother must have met his death by some accident,

<P>

or want of precaution, and to-morrow I will start on the same quest.&quot;

<P>

<P>

Terrified at the thought that she might lose her only remaining
<P>

brother, the princess entreated him to give up his project,
<P>

but he remained firm.  Before setting out, however, he gave her a
<P>

chaplet<A NAME = "AO109713"></A><A NAME = "AS109714"></A> of a hundred pearls<A NAME = "BB1097113"></A><A HREF = "SPP378.HTM#BB1134614"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and said, &quot;When I am absent, tell this

<P>

over daily for me.  But if you should find that the beads stick,
<P>

so that they will not slip one after the other, you will know that
<P>

my brother's fate has befallen me.  Still, we must hope for better luck.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

Then he departed, and on the twentieth day of his journey fell
<P>

in with the dervish on the same spot as Prince Bahman had met him,
<P>

and began to question him as to the place where the Talking Bird,

the eyes<A NAME = "AO113095"></A><A NAME = "AS113096"></A><A NAME = "AB113097"></A> of the people who crowded the streets were fixed on the two
<P>

young men, strangers to every one.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Oh, if only the Sultan<A NAME = "AO1131212"></A> had had sons like that!&quot; they murmured,

<P>

&quot;they look so distinguished and are about the same age that his sons

<P>

would have been!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO113165"></A> commanded that splendid apartments should be prepared for the

<P>

two brothers, and even insisted that they should sit at table with him. 

<P>

During dinner he led the conversation to various scientific subjects,
<P>

and also to history, of which he was especially fond, but whatever
<P>

topic they might be discussing he found that the views of the young
<P>

men were always worth listening to.  &quot;If they were my own sons,&quot;

<P>

he said to himself, &quot;they could not be better educated!&quot; and aloud

<P>

he complimented them on their learning and taste for knowledge.
<P>

<P>

At the end of the evening the princes once more prostrated themselves
<P>

before the throne and asked leave to return home; and then,
<P>

encouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the Sultan,
<P>

Prince Bahman said:  &quot;Sire, may we dare to take the liberty of asking

<P>

whether you would do us and our sister the honour of resting for
<P>

a few minutes at our house the first time the hunt passes that way?&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;With the utmost pleasure<A NAME = "AO1133210"></A>,&quot; replied the Sultan; &quot;and as I am

<P>

all impatience to see the sister of such accomplished young men
<P>

you may expect me the day after to-morrow.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The princess<A NAME = "AO113365"></A> was of course most anxious to entertain the Sultan
<P>

in a fitting way, but as she had no experience in court customs
<P>

she ran to the Talking Bird, and begged he would advise her

At the word treasure, Aladdin<A NAME = "AS795011"></A><A NAME = "BB795012"></A><A HREF = "SPP265.HTM#BB796126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> forgot his fears, and grasped the ring
<P>

as he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather. 
<P>

The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Go down,&quot; said the magician; &quot;at the foot of those steps you
will find
<P>

an open door leading into three large halls.  Tuck up your gown and go
<P>

through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly. 
<P>

These halls<A NAME = "AO79575"></A><A NAME = "AS79576"></A> lead into a garden<A NAME = "AB795715"></A> of fine fruit trees.  Walk on till
<P>

you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp. 
<P>

Pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

He drew<A NAME = "AS79615"></A> a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin<A NAME = "BB796126"></A><A HREF = "SPP265.HTM#BB79645"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

bidding him prosper.
<P>

<P>

Aladdin<A NAME = "AO79643"></A><A NAME = "AS79644"></A><A NAME = "BB79645"></A><A HREF = "SPP265.HTM#BB796823"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> found everything as the magician had said, gathered some
<P>

fruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth
<P>

of the cave.  The magician cried out in a great hurry:
<P>

<P>

&quot;Make haste and give me the lamp.&quot;  This Aladdin<A NAME = "AS796822"></A><A NAME = "BB796823"></A><A HREF = "SPP265.HTM#BB797412"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> refused to do 
until
<P>

he was out of the cave.  The magician flew into a terrible passion,
<P>

and throwing some more powder on the fire, he said something,
<P>

and the stone rolled back into its place.
<P>

<P>

The magician<A NAME = "AO79735"></A><A NAME = "AS79736"></A> left Persia<A NAME = "BB797311"></A><A HREF = "SPP329.HTM#BB987920"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> for ever, which plainly showed that he
<P>

was no<A NAME = "AS79745"></A> uncle of Aladdin's<A NAME = "BB797412"></A><A HREF = "SPP265.HTM#BB797810"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, but a cunning magician who had read in
<P>

his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most
<P>

powerful man in the world.  Though he alone knew where to find it,
<P>

he could only receive it from the hand of another.  He had picked
<P>

out the foolish Aladdin<A NAME = "AS79789"></A><A NAME = "BB797810"></A><A HREF = "SPP266.HTM#BB798111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> for this purpose, intending to get the lamp

dragged the body to the top of the stairs, and then hurried away
<P>

with my wife back to our house.  In descending the stairs the doctor
<P>

accidentally knocked over the corpse, and finding him dead believed
<P>

that he himself was the murderer.  But now you know the truth set
<P>

him free, and let me die in his stead.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The chief<A NAME = "AO49855"></A> of police and the crowd of spectators were lost in astonishment

<P>

at the strange events<A NAME = "AO49869"></A><A NAME = "AS498610"></A> to which the death<A NAME = "AB498619"></A> of the hunchback had given rise.

<P>

<P>

&quot;Loosen the Jewish doctor,&quot; said he to the hangman, &quot;and 
string up
<P>

the tailor instead, since he has made confession of his crime. 
<P>

Really, one cannot deny that this is a very singular story,
<P>

and it deserves to be written in letters of gold.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The executioner<A NAME = "AO49935"></A><A NAME = "AS49936"></A><A NAME = "BB49937"></A><A HREF = "SPP261.HTM#BB784921"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> speedily untied the knots which confined the doctor,
<P>

and was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor, when the
<P>

Sultan of Kashgar, who had missed his jester, happened to make
<P>

inquiry of his officers as to what had become of him.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; replied they, &quot;the hunchback having drunk more than 
was
<P>

good for him, escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about
<P>

the town, where this morning he was found dead.  A man was arrested
<P>

for having caused his death, and held in custody till a gallows
<P>

was erected.  At the moment that he was about to suffer punishment,
<P>

first<A NAME = "AO50033"></A> one man arrived, and then another, each accusing themselves
<P>

of the murder<A NAME = "AO50047"></A>, and this went on for a long time, and at the
<P>

present instant the chief of police is engaged in questioning
<P>

a man who declares that he alone is the true assassin.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO50085"></A><A NAME = "AS50086"></A><A NAME = "AB50087"></A><A HREF = "SPP184.HTM#BB55398"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Kashgar no sooner heard these words than he ordered

The prince smilingly shook his head, and thanking the dervish
<P>

once more, he sprang on his horse and threw the ball before him.
<P>

<P>

The ball rolled along the road so fast that Prince Bahman had much
<P>

difficulty in keeping up with it, and it never relaxed its speed
<P>

till the foot of the mountain was reached.  Then it came to a
<P>

sudden halt, and the prince at once got down and flung the bridle
<P>

on his horse's neck.  He paused for a moment and looked round him
<P>

at the masses of black stones with which the sides of the mountain
<P>

were covered, and then began resolutely to ascend.  He had hardly
<P>

gone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around him,
<P>

although not another creature was in sight.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Who is this imbecile?&quot; cried some, &quot;stop him at once.&quot; 
&quot;Kill him,&quot;
<P>

shrieked others, &quot;Help! robbers! murderers! help! help!&quot;  &quot;
Oh, let
<P>

him alone,&quot; sneered another, and this was the most trying of all,
<P>

&quot;he is such a beautiful young man; I am sure the bird and the cage

<P>

must have been kept for him.&quot;
<P>

<P>

At first<A NAME = "AO109395"></A><A NAME = "AS109396"></A> the prince took no heed to all this clamour<A NAME = "AB1093925"></A>, but continued
<P>

to press forward on his way.  Unfortunately this conduct, instead of
<P>

silencing the voices, only seemed to irritate them the more,
<P>

and they arose with redoubled fury, in front as well as behind. 
<P>

After some time he grew bewildered, his knees<A NAME = "AO1094317"></A><A NAME = "AS1094318"></A> began to tremble<A NAME = "AB1094325"></A>,
<P>

and finding himself in the act of falling, he forgot altogether
<P>

the advice of the dervish.  He turned to fly down the mountain,
<P>

and in one<A NAME = "AO109467"></A> moment became a black stone.
<P>

<P>

As may be imagined, Prince Perviz and his sister were all this
<P>

eyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage,
<P>

and tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works,
<P>

but the dream<A NAME = "AO93017"></A> seemed to him a direct warning, and he resolved to put
<P>

the journey off no longer.
<P>

<P>

The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares
<P>

he had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he
<P>

might trade with on the road.  The shop itself he sold also,
<P>

and easily found a tenant for his private house.  The only matter he
<P>

could not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand
<P>

pieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him.
<P>

<P>

After some thought, Ali<A NAME = "AO93119"></A><A NAME = "AS931110"></A><A NAME = "BB931111"></A><A HREF = "SPP310.HTM#BB932514"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one. 

<P>

He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom of it,
<P>

filled up the rest with olives.  After corking the vase tightly down,
<P>

he carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself,
<P>

and said to him:
<P>

<P>

&quot;My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a caravan

<P>

in a few days for Mecca.  I have come to ask whether you would
<P>

do me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come back?&quot;

<P>

<P>

The merchant replied readily, &quot;Look, this is the key of my shop: 
<P>

take it, and put the vase wherever you like.  I promise that you shall
<P>

find it in the same place on your return.&quot;
<P>

<P>

A few days later, Ali<A NAME = "AO932511"></A><A NAME = "AS932512"></A><A NAME = "AS932513"></A><A NAME = "BB932514"></A><A HREF = "SPP311.HTM#BB93385"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Cogia mounted the camel<A NAME = "AB932523"></A> that he had laden
<P>

with merchandise<A NAME = "AO93265"></A>, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time
<P>

at Mecca.  Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque,
<P>

and after all his religious duties were performed, he set out his

the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies,
<P>

diamonds, and emeralds, he cried:
<P>

<P>

&quot;It is a world's wonder!  There is only one thing that surprises me. 

<P>

Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;No, sir<A NAME = "AS82256"></A>, by design,&quot; returned Aladdin<A NAME = "BB822517"></A><A HREF = "SPP274.HTM#BB82364"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  &quot;I wished your 
Majesty
<P>

to have the glory of finishing this palace.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO82285"></A> was pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city. 
<P>

He showed them the unfinished<A NAME = "AO822911"></A> window, and bade them fit it up like
<P>

the others.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sir,&quot; replied their spokesman, &quot;we cannot find jewels 
enough.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to
<P>

no purpose, for in a month's time the work was not half done. 
<P>

Aladdin<A NAME = "AS82363"></A><A NAME = "BB82364"></A><A HREF = "SPP274.HTM#BB823910"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their
<P>

work and carry the jewels back, and the genie finished the window
<P>

at his command.  The Sultan<A NAME = "AO823811"></A> was surprised to receive his jewels
<P>

again and visited<A NAME = "AS82397"></A> Aladdin<A NAME = "BB823910"></A><A HREF = "SPP274.HTM#BB82436"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, who showed him the window finished. 
<P>

The Sultan embraced him, the envious vizir meanwhile hinting
<P>

that it was the work of enchantment.
<P>

<P>

Aladdin<A NAME = "AO82433"></A><A NAME = "AS82434"></A><A NAME = "AS82435"></A><A NAME = "BB82436"></A><A HREF = "SPP274.HTM#BB824823"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had won the hearts<A NAME = "AB824315"></A> of the people by his gentle bearing. 
<P>

He was made captain of the Sultan's armies, and won several battles
<P>

for him, but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus
<P>

in peace and content for several years.
<P>

<H2>The Seven<A NAME = "AS31814"></A><A NAME = "AB31815"></A> Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor</H2>

<P>

<P>

IN the times<A NAME = "AO31847"></A><A NAME = "AS31848"></A> of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad<A NAME = "BB318429"></A><A HREF = "SPP106.HTM#BB320522"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

a poor<A NAME = "AO31855"></A> porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sent
<P>

to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other. 
<P>

Before he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that,
<P>

finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled
<P>

with rose<A NAME = "AO31895"></A> water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden
<P>

upon the ground<A NAME = "AO31907"></A>, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house. 
<P>

Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place;
<P>

a delicious<A NAME = "AO31925"></A><A NAME = "AS31926"></A><A NAME = "AS31927"></A> perfume<A NAME = "AB319210"></A> of aloes wood and pastilles<A NAME = "AB319221"></A> came from the open
<P>

windows<A NAME = "AO31933"></A> and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed
<P>

up from the hot pavement.  Within the palace he heard some music,
<P>

as of many instruments<A NAME = "AO31959"></A><A NAME = "AS319510"></A> cunningly played, and the melodious<A NAME = "AB319521"></A> warble
<P>

of nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the appetising smell
<P>

of many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judged
<P>

that feasting and merry making were going on.  He wondered who lived
<P>

in this magnificent house which he had never seen before, the street
<P>

in which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass. 
<P>

To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servants

<P>

who stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the master
<P>

of the mansion.
<P>

<P>

&quot;What,&quot; replied he, &quot;do you live<A NAME = "AS320517"></A> in Bagdad<A NAME = "BB320522"></A><A HREF = "SPP111.HTM#BB33549"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and not know that
here
<P>

call us away for the space of forty days.  The time has now come;
<P>

but before we depart, we will leave you our keys, so that you
<P>

may not lack entertainment during our absence.  But one thing
<P>

we would ask of you.  The Golden Door, alone, forbear to open,
<P>

as you value your own peace, and the happiness of your life. 
<P>

That door once unlocked, we must bid you farewell for ever.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Weeping, I assured them of my prudence, and after embracing
<P>

me tenderly, they went their ways.
<P>

<P>

Every day I opened two or three fresh doors, each of which
<P>

contained behind it so many curious things that I had no chance
<P>

of feeling dull, much as I regretted the absence of the ladies. 
<P>

Sometimes it was an orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bigness
<P>

any that grew in my father's garden.  Sometimes it was a court
<P>

planted<A NAME = "AO31043"></A><A NAME = "AS31044"></A><A NAME = "AS31045"></A><A NAME = "AS31046"></A><A NAME = "AS31047"></A><A NAME = "AS31048"></A> with roses<A NAME = "AB310413"></A>, jessamine<A NAME = "AB310416"></A>, dafeodils<A NAME = "AB310419"></A>, hyacinths<A NAME = "AB310422"></A> and anemones<A NAME = "AB310427"></A>,
<P>

and a thousand other flowers of which I did not know the names. 
<P>

Or again, it would be an aviary, fitted with all kinds of singing birds,

<P>

or a treasury<A NAME = "AO31077"></A> heaped up with precious stones; but whatever I might see,

<P>

all was perfect of its own sort.
<P>

<P>

Thirty-nine days passed away more rapidly than I could have
<P>

conceived possible, and the following morning the princesses were
<P>

to return to the castle.  But alas!  I had explored every corner,
<P>

save only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door, and I
<P>

had no longer anything to amuse myself with.  I stood before the
<P>

forbidden place for some time, gazing at its beauty; then a happy
<P>

inspiration struck me, that because I unlocked the door it was not
<P>

necessary that I should enter the chamber.  It would be enough
<P>

for me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be therein.

&quot;Tell your master,&quot; said the tailor, &quot;that we have brought a 
very sick
<P>

man for him to cure; and,&quot; he added, holding out some money, &quot;give
him
<P>

this in advance, so that he may not feel he is wasting his time.&quot; 

<P>

The servant<A NAME = "AO47725"></A> remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor,
<P>

and the moment she was out of sight the tailor and his wife carried
<P>

the body swiftly after her, propped it up at the top of the staircase,
<P>

and ran home as fast as their legs could carry them.
<P>

<P>

Now the doctor<A NAME = "AO47777"></A> was so delighted at the news of a patient (for he
<P>

was young, and had not many of them), that he was transported
<P>

with joy.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Get a light,&quot; he called to the servant, &quot;and follow me as 
fast as
<P>

you can!&quot; and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase. 

<P>

There he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback, and without knowing

<P>

what it was gave it such a kick that it rolled right to the bottom,
<P>

and very nearly dragged the doctor after it.  &quot;A light! a light!&quot;

<P>

he cried again, and when it was brought and he saw what he had done
<P>

he was almost beside himself with terror.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Holy Moses!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;why did I not wait for the light
? 
<P>

I have killed the sick man whom they brought me; and if the sacred
<P>

Ass<A NAME = "AO47913"></A><A NAME = "AS47914"></A><A NAME = "AB47915"></A> of Esdras does not come to my aid I am lost!  It will not be long
<P>

before I am led to jail as a murderer.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Agitated though he was, and with reason, the doctor did not forget
<P>

to shut the house door, lest some passers-by might chance to see
<P>

what had happened.  He then took up the corpse and carried it
<P>

into his wife's room, nearly driving her crazy with fright.
