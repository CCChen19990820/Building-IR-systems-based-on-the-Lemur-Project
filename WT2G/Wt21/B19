<P><br><br>

<P>
<B>Date:</B>March
21, 1996<br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">To:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Interested
Partiers </FONT><br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">From:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Thomas
Lenard, Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies</FONT><br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">RE:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Summary
of Discussion at March 18, 1996, Environment Roundtable</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is a general consensus that the environment
has improved significantly over the last quarter century, as a
result of many factors including, but not limited to, government
programs.  The nation has in fact gotten something for the hundreds
of billions of dollars that it spends each year on the environment,
though not as much as it should have.  Our environmental policies
have from the outset been subject to criticism for their reliance
on rigid, command-and-control methods that stifle innovation and
the development of new technologies.  With more flexible, better-designed
policies, we could be getting much greater environmental benefits
and more economic growth at the same time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In an increasingly dynamic economy, the current
framework of environmental regulation is viewed as an increasingly
burdensome &quot;dinosaur.&quot;  As one of the participants observed,
the dinosaur, full of bones and therefore inflexible, did not
survive.  In contrast, the shark, a contemporary of the dinosaur,
had no bones, only cartilage, and has survived to modern times.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">MESSAGE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There was widespread agreement at the roundtable
that proponents of change have not developed an effective way
of communicating with a population that is strongly environmentalist.
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There was also agreement that the message
should focus on our ability to do a better job of providing environmental
benefits and on what a better environment means - not that we
can do it at lower cost.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, focusing on excessive regulatory
costs and the need to base regulations on good risk and cost-benefit
analysis does not resonate with the public.  In fact, it is likely
that lower costs translates into lower benefits in many people's
minds.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">DEVELOPING A REPLACEMENT<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A prerequisite to developing a good message
is developing a vision of the direction in which environmental
policy should go, as well as some specific policy proposals. 
<I>Criticizing the existing framework without proposing something
to replace it is not persuasive</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The business community has strongly supported
regulatory reform legislation, which had tough sledding in 1995
because it was proposed in a vision vacuum and was perceived (and
sometimes promoted) as a rollback of existing protections.  In
fact, the payoff to regulatory reform legislation is probably
overstated, because it is based on the assumption that we can
mandate regulation that is well-informed and rational.  This has
never been the case in any regulatory context, and there is no
reason to expect it now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Rather, <I>the challenge is to establish institutions
that create the right incentives to produce environmental benefits</I>
- but with appropriate incentives to also incorporate other values.
 Environmental policies should be more flexible, focus on outputs
rather than inputs, and rely to a much greater extent on property
rights and market-oriented approaches.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">EXAMPLES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There was substantial support for devolving
environmental responsibilities to the states, and for the view
that this frequently leads to better decisions, because costs
and benefits are borne by the same population.  A recurring theme
was that the states are more receptive to new ideas and have adopted
them more readily than has the federal government.  For example:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">North Carolina's Tar-Pimlico River Basin
Association is North America's only operating river association
that brings together point and nonpoint sources of pollution in
a combined trading effort to reduce discharges into a river. 
This approach, which is common elsewhere, is based on property
rights and contracts and was achieved with the support of the
Environmental Defense Fund.  River basin managers monitor outcomes
- the quality of the river - and the responsibility of paying
for damages disciplines polluters.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The state of Pennsylvania now accepts ISO
14000 certification, which frequently is necessary for trading
in world markets, as a substitute for evidence that firms meet
Pennsylvania standards.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Numerous other examples, not necessarily new,
of ways to provide a better incentive structure were discussed:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Performance goals should be established
with complete flexibility to meet those goals in the most efficient
manner.  This rewards rather than penalizes innovation.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Auditing programs should provide an incentive
to uncover problems and provide solutions.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Positive incentives should be provided
to landowners for habitat conservation and wildlife protection,
through creation of markets or by bringing the costs of environmental
amenities on-budget.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, we can learn something from the Europeans,
who frequently deal with environmental issues in a less contentious
and litigious fashion than we do here.  For example, the European
system for dealing with abandoned hazardous waste sites is actually
producing results.  Depending on the level of the hazard, sites
are being contained or mitigated, sometimes at public expense,
and returned to appropriate uses.</FONT>

<p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of strong families, good schools and faithful churches and 
by the power of their own appeal, movies have become an increasingly 
dominant force on our social landscape.
<li>The real and most important power of film is its capacity to alter moral 
sensibilities, and to mold dispositions, outlooks, and habits of the mind 
and heart. The consistent bombardment of gratuitous violence, sexual 
innuendo, profanity, and degradation from popular movies eventually 
shapes, alters, and colors our sensibility.
<li>Despite the significant number of films in the category of <i>Showgirls, 
Striptease, Pulp Fiction</i>, and <i>Natural Born Killers</i> we have seen a 
resurgence in movies that promote traditional moral values such as: <br>
<center>Honor -- <i>Braveheart</i><br>
Courage -- <i>Apollo 13</i><br>
Patriotism -- <i>Independence Day</i><br>
Faithfulness -- <i>Forest Gump</i><br>
Perseverance -- <i>Babe</i><p></center>

<li>In fact, seven of the ten top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, 
PG, or PG-13 and all of the ten top-grossing movies of all-time had 
ratings of G, PG or PG-13 and are considered family oriented.

<Title>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the Box Office in 1995</Title>
<Body BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

<blockquote>
<center><H2>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the <br>Box Office in 1995</H2>
<H3>Some see ‘sleaze doesn't sell' trend</H3>
by Joyce Price, <i>The Washington Times</i></center>
<p>
Seven of the 10 top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, PG or PG-13, indicating they were family oriented.
<p>
"For half [or more] of the films [that grossed the most sales] to qualify 
for more general audiences is pretty encouraging, said James Wall, editor 
of the Christian Century, a historic mainline Protestant journal.
<p>
"The box-office results are a good indication that audiences are looking 
for more peaceful experiences in the theater and that they respond to 
worthwhile films," added Mr. Wall, who has testified on movie content at 
congressional hearings.
<p>
Only three films near the bottom of the top 10 were rated R, meaning 
children under 17 had to be accompanied by an adult to see those 
pictures.
<p>
No films with the NC-17 rating, meaning children under 17 are not 
admitted, were among the top 10 this year, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., a California entertainment research organization that 
tracks such information.
<p>
"This shows that, for now at least, sleaze doesn't sell and that, over time, 
the movie industry “is moving toward general audiences,” said Doug 
Besharov, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
<p>
Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and co-host of 
"Sneak Previews," which airs on 244 Public Broadcasting Service 
stations nationwide, put it this way: "Sixty percent of all movies that are 
released are Rated, yet only 30 percent of films in the top 10 and zero 
percent in the top six are R-rated . . . Samuel Goldwyn once said it's 
better to sell four tickets than two. That's common sense that the movie 
industry" is just now beginning to recognize.
<p>
Mr. Medved said the latest top 10 offers more evidence that a “PG-13 is 
an easier rating to sell tickets on than R."
<p>
PG-13 means special guidance is cautioned because material may be 
inappropriate for ages 13 and under; PG means parental guidance is 
suggested; and G, for general audience, means all ages are admitted.
<p>
Jack J. Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, 
argues that movie grosses in 1995 rose or fell on the basis of a film's 
"entertainment value,” not its rating and whether it was or was not a 
family film.
<p>
He said there was no shortage of family films produced this year, but 
there was a "shortage of family audiences." He noted there were "10 to 12 
family films released this year that failed miserably at the box office."
<p>
One of those, he said, was "The Little Princess," which he described as a 
"wonderful, tremendous film" that few went to see. "The Little Princess" 
is about a young girl whose father, a distinguished British gentleman, 
goes off to battle in World War I. The child is enrolled in a private girls' 
academy in New York, where she suffers mistreatment by an abusive 
headmistress.
<P>
"The kind of films people claim they want in the marketplace, they don't 
patronize . . . this constant reference to wanting family films is 
hypocrisy," Mr. Valenti said in an interview.
<P>
The NC-17-rated film "Showgirls" was a box-office flop not because of 
its nudity and sex, Mr. Valenti said, but because it was a "mediocre film 
to begin with" and "the word got out it wasn't a very good movie." 
"Showgirls" depicted the struggles of an ex-prostitute who becomes a Las 
Vegas lap dancer and aspires to be a highly paid stripper.
<P>
Not everyone concerned about the content and quality of movie fare sees 
cause to celebrate this year's list of the biggest grossers.
<P>
Said Ted Baehr, chairman of the Atlanta-based Christian Film and 
Television Commission; which each year makes a thorough analysis of 
hundreds of films in a “report to Hollywood":
<P>
"Last year, 60 percent of the top 10 grossing films met our moral criteria. 
This year, it will be 40 percent with the list as it now exists. In other 
words, we've slipped . . . it's been a lousy year for movies."
<P>
Movies in last year's top 10 included “The Lion King,” rated G, and 
"Forrest Gump," rated PG-13, which both have grossed more than $310 
million. “Batman Forever,” this year's biggest box office smash, has 
grossed $184 million to date.
<P>
Mr. Baehr said “Hollywood was clearly aiming at children" when it 
produced films such as "Batman Forever," "Ace Ventura: When Nature 
Calls" (No. 5) and "Casper" (No. 6). But he does not view those pictures 
as true family entertainment and describes "Ace,” "Casper,” and 
"Waterworld" (No. 9) as "irresponsible."
<P>
Of Jim Carrey's latest "Ace Ventura” detective comedy, Mr. Baehr said: 
“We do not consider it to be a moral movie. It's racist and 
promasturbation, pro-sex and probuggery."
<P>
In “Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls,” Mr. Carrey goes to Africa in 
search of a great white bat. There he encounters a tribe whose members 
spit or release other bodily fluids on people to show their appreciation.
<P>
"It's clear Hollywood knows it has to broaden" its horizons and make 
more films that will attract youngsters, he said. But many of these films 
feature "covert immorality" and take "philosophical positions most 
conservatives can’t accept."
<P>
Mr. Baehr charged that the movie industry is "cutting back on [true] 
family films."
<P>
“If they make this a trend,” they can anticipate a drop in attendance, he 
said. He added this is already being reflected in the smaller revenues that 
have been generated by this year's top 10 compared with last year's.
<P>
"People want films you can take the family to,” Mr. Baehr said.
<P>
Mr. Valenti denied there is a conspiracy afoot in the movie industry, as 
Mr. Baehr suggests. "Eighty to 85 percent of all films made in Hollywood 
are put together by independent producers, who are fiercely competitive,” 
he said.
<P>
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., agreed. "These 
things go in cycles. Certainly, there is no premeditated plan to make a lot 
of kids pictures,” he said.
<P>
As for the films that grossed the most this year, he said, "I don't think 
you'd call 'Batman Forever' a family picture. And 'Ace Ventura' is a little 
gross. There are some questionable scenes."
<P>
Mr. Wall offered this assessment of “Batman Forever": "It's a rather dark 
film, but I don't object to it very strongly. 'Apollo 13' [No. 2] was well 
done, one of the finest inspirational films for people of all ages."
<P>
Those interviewed had little enthusiasm for the movie “Pocahantas.” Mr. 
Wall called it "adequate," while Mr. Baehr labeled it “New Age" and 
"annoying."
<P>
Mr. Medved said he "didn't like the film's political correctness."

<P></center>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Kemp’s remarks were delivered on November 19, 1996 at the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe's Annual Dinner in New York, where he received an award named in memory of the distinguished humanitarian, Mr. Raoul Wallenberg.  Mr. Kemp was introduced by Rabbi Simcha Lyons.<BA></blockquote></blockquote></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thank you very much for this award in the name of Raoul Wallenberg, a great hero of mine.  In September of 1981 I had the honor of working with Congressman Tom Lantos to pass legislation granting honorary U.S. citizenship to this courageous "soldier of the soul."  And thank you to the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe, for whose work in the causes of education and human rights -- and in so many other endeavors to promote liberty throughout the world --  I hold a profound regard.
<P>
In 1899, Emile Zola, in his famous outcry against the anti-semitism manifest in the French Army's conspiracy to convict Captain Dreyfus of treason, spoke to the inevitable triumph of truth over prejudice when he said, "truth is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."  At the time, the French people were polarized over the controversy which presented them with a moral choice between the life of one man and the reputation of the French Army.  
<P>
As America approaches the turn of the next century, we face many similar controversies -- controversies which challenge us to make a moral choice between political expediency and the inalienable right to liberty.  Fortified by the memory of our great heritage and what is occurring at breakneck speed in the world, we can now proclaim, with equal conviction: "Democracy is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."   But the task of preserving and advancing this democratic evolution will take truth-tellers, seekers of justice, men and women of honor and courage willing to act on their convictions.  
v
It will take men and women such as Raoul Wallenberg and people like you who form this great Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe.
<P>
 Historically, every form of government or societal structure that refused to recognize the basic human right of freedom has failed.  Whether it be the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the persecution of the Christians in Rome, the oppression of the peasant class by the aristocracy in pre-revolutionary France, the lack of just representation for the American colonies by the British monarchy, the evil of slavery in pre-Civil War America, the abuse of labor in industrial England, the comprehensive manipulation and subjugation of people by the socialist systems of Eastern and Central Europe and in Asia, or the monstrous evil of apartheid in South Africa -- tyranny infallibly authors its own epitaph.   The oppressed are driven to the point of revolt.  The system collapses internally, unable to supply the hope, motivation and freedom that promotes the general welfare of a people and a nation and which responds to the Jewish and Christian ideal of freedom as an inalienable, God-given right of all people everywhere and always.
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had the historical honor of being a victim of both Nazi and Communist tyranny.  I say an honor because this persecution is the mark of a  Godly man, of a liberal man in the classical sense.  For there is only one truth, but many lies; one charity, but many forms of envy and selfishness.  To stand up for what is good, right and true often, attracts enemies from very different directions.
<P>
The world is in a similar situation today, with democracy and freedom being attacked from different angles.
<P>
Democracy is on the march, and on the surface, appears to have unstoppable momentum.  Just yesterday, Romania celebrated the triumphal election of anti-Communist Emil Constantinescu as President -- a fact which, in Constantinescu's own words, signifies that "Romania comes back now to the great concert of a democratic Europe."  In the Freedom House survey, more than half the people of the world live in countries that are democratic or somewhat democratic.  In economic terms, the worldwide trend toward democracy is even stronger.  More than 93 percent of the world's trade  comes from democratic and partly democratic countries.  (Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1989 and 1996.)  As a matter of economic and industrial output, communism and dictatorship barely exist, and where their production is rising -- Vietnam, China -- it is only because regimes are falling all over themselves to "open up to the outside" and establish economic and trade liberalization.
v
But there are threats to political and economic freedom, to democracy, from without and within.  They are not as violent, purposive, or determined as the enemies Raoul Wallenberg fought, and we may thank God for it.  But they are serious and important, and if they are more corrosive than aggressive in nature, they may nevertheless poison our civilization if left unchecked.
<P>
One is the threat foreseen by Alexis de Tocqueville more than 150 years ago.  Tocqueville called this the velvet tyranny of mindless, numbing bureaucracy.  It would not outlaw religion, but it would sap the human spirit, and set up a new pseudo-religion, the worship of the state, in place of churches and synagogues.  It would not brazenly abolish private property, but it would smother property -- and, what is equally important, human initiative -- in a well-meaning but deadly array of taxes, regulations, and stipulations.
<P>
Lincoln summed up the animating spirit of Tocqueville's velvet tyranny when he described the spirit of slavery in America -- and we may regard it as chilling that the terms would have such a resemblance.  Lincoln called this the idea of "you plant the grain, you make the bread, and I'll eat it."  Lincoln went on to say that we must not rest until this "artificial weight is lifted from the shoulders of all mankind."
<P>
In the affairs of the world that Wallenberg cared so deeply about, the force of velvet tyranny is most visible, and certainly most important, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  On the one hand, these countries have enjoyed a miraculous transformation.  On the other hand, they have endured a decline in industrial production and gross output for which it is difficult to find a parallel.  Russian, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian output dropped by more than 50 percent in real terms over five years -- a record that puts our "Great Depression" to shame.
<P>
History teaches that this kind of economic implosion often hastens tyranny, whether it be tyranny of the far left or the far right.  The rise of Nazi Germany was preceded by the Weimar Republic's tragedy of runaway inflation in the '20s followed by democratically-elected Henrich Brunning's economics of austerity in the early '30s.  This precipitated Brunning's abolishment of the Reichstag and thus a coalition government in 1933, led by Adolph Hitler.  And Soviet Communism grew out of the state-directed industrial capitalism in Russia during the confusion of World War I.
<P>
The response of the West to today's economic threat to democracy has not been encouraging.  For more than five years, going back to the Houston Summit, the United States and the West have been presented with one of the great opportunities for creative statesmanship in human history.  Instead of seizing it, as we did under Harry Truman, General Marshall, and Western Unification, we have turned it over to the International Monetary Fund.
<P>
Today, the top Russian tax rate is close to 70 percent on income from labor, and what little money a Russian worker is left with after this is taxed through high value-added, excise, and other consumption taxes.  The same is true, by the way, in Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Europe.  The tax rate on some types of labor and business activity is over 90 percent.
<P>
No wonder wages today are less than 38 percent of Russia's entire economy -- a situation which has driven one of the most talented peoples in the world underground.  Again, the pattern is nearly identical in Hungary and other countries.  (In OECD countries, wages typically account for more than 60 percent of national income.)  The people who have done some of the best reporting on the true Russian tax burden, a newsletter called Emerging Markets Watch down in Washington, have managed to cull these data out of the ridiculously secret IMF memoranda and staff reports that go by top officials there every few weeks.  But it is only by months and years of tireless digging that they've been able to uncover what should be public knowledge -- how the U.S. and the West are spending, or rather mis-spending, the billions in annual "aid" to Eastern Europe.
<P>
Somehow, the IMF and the West -- which should be leading a sweeping Russian tax, monetary and trade reform -- remain numb to the urgency of bringing economic growth to the new democracies.  Do you know that two years ago, the IMF insisted that Russia increase its taxes by 4.1 percent of GDP in one year?  To put this in perspective, both the Bush and Clinton tax increases that attracted such displeasure in the U.S. in the last five years were less than 1 percent of GDP, and these at least were not piled on the back of a crippled economy.
<P>
This is not a partisan issue.  It goes back to the Bush administration, when we encouraged the same mind-numbing austerity as is being applied to Russia, Hungary, and Poland today through the IMF's conditionality agreements and Article IV process.  In 1993, I joined with the late Ed Muskie, George Soros, Senator Joe Lieberman, and a group of nearly three dozen other leading Americans of both parties to urge the president to take the fate of Russia out of the hands of the inept and incapable economists at the IMF and devise a serious, direct program of Western aid and trade to bring economic growth to the emerging democracies of Central and East Europe.
<P>
The post-Cold-War peace must not become another Versailles settlement of pain and austerity.  America and the West must see that they cannot afford to send the common reply, "it isn't our concern."   We must dedicate ourselves to the opposite spirit, the spirit of liberal optimism and open trade with the East.  And we must resolve to include Eastern Europe and Russia at the table.
<P>
I am reminded of a famous cartoon from Wallenberg's time, in which Russia, Germany, and Hungary were at the front end of a ship that was rapidly taking in water.  The ship was labeled, "The World Monetary Crisis," and the year was about 1927, as the first signs of protectionism and deflation were making themselves felt.  In the back of the ship were three men labeled France, Britain, and the United States.  They watched with interest and a little bit of sympathy as the men bailed furiously in front.   But they were not concerned.  "Awful leak," said one of them.  "Yes, awful," said another.  "Thank goodness it's not in our end of the boat."
<P>
Today, democracy is doing much better, but the burden on us is that much higher.  We have a tremendous opportunity to secure the fruits of the Cold War victory: to build a stable and prosperous Eastern and Central Europe; to guard Russia from a new form of tyranny -- economic tyranny.  
<P>
 Indeed, we are bound by the awesome responsibility that comes with our own freedom to guard the rightful freedom of all people.  
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had a profound understanding of this moral imperative.  He refused to accept the awful conclusion that we needn't be concerned about others, or that there is "nothing we can do."  He did not believe the unpragmatic counsel that we can ignore the front of the boat because it isn't our end.   His life was an incarnate assertion of the equal and opposite imperative -- the democratic imperative, the assertion of Rabbi Hillel, the New Testament, and Hebrew Scripture, that we are our brother's keeper, and our neighbor's brother.
<P>
As President Reagan said during the Rose Garden ceremony conferring honorary American citizenship upon Wallenberg:  " . . a man makes at least a start on understanding the meaning of human life when he plants shade trees under which he will never sit.  Raoul Wallenberg is just such a man.  He nurtured the lives of those he never knew at the risk of his own."  What better example to look to as we challenge ourselves to respond to the needs of a changing world -- to plant the trees of shade, succor and democratic successes under which we might never sit, but which will surely shelter our children and grandchildren in the 21st century.  Let us resolve not that it be an American Century per se -- but a Democratic Century for all.

Now that the political season is over, let's talk about some other matters which are arguably as important -- indeed, I would argue that they are more important -- than the matters raised in the recent political debate.  Last week the National Commission on Civic Renewal was announced.  The executive director is Bill Galston, formerly Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser, and a very able man.  The Commission is co-chaired by Sam Nunn and me, and it will address issues of civic trust; our morale and national mood; the fraying social fabric; and moral decline.
<P>
Today I would like to give you my take on this -- where we are, where I think we, the American people, need to go, and what's missing in our public conversation.  Let me say at the outset that I believe that in a fundamental way, many of our conversations are missing the mark.
<P>
Here's a question to start with -- a question which implicitly runs throughout my talk and one which is, I think, an interesting question for our time: why, when we have so much material wealth, are Americans so cynical, so distressed, so angry with each other, so untrusting, so ticked off about so many things?  Why, when for so many things are so good, do we feel so bad?
<P>
The evidence is all around us: the whining and the complaining; the explosion in recent years in the use of Prozac; and alcohol abuse and drug use.   The Commission takes as its fundamental data a dramatic national increase in rudeness; in incivility; in litigiousness; in the growing belief that we are all victims; in the frequency of visits to psychiatrists; in the increased amount of suicide, particularly among the young; and in increased complaints about stress.  
<P>
Earlier this month an American Automobile Association survey showed that aggressive driving cases involving death or injury are on a record pace in 1996, and incidents of violent "highway hooliganism" have increased 50 percent from 1990 through 1995.  And last week a survey of high-achieving students revealed that among many of these high school students stress, drugs and thoughts of death fill their lives.  This is a report from out youngest people in this, the most successful country in the history of the world.
<P>
Well, judging from mountains of interviews and stories from the political debate that we just concluded, many in politics still give an answer to this question that has economics at its base.  You know the litany -- and we've had a whole lot of it in the last couple of years: "economic stagnation," "flat wages," the "American Dream" is getting further and further out of reach, that sort of thing.  But is that diagnosis correct?  I don't think so.
<P>
I don't think the objective material and economic facts can explain what I'm talking about, because while it's obvious that economic things are far from perfect, the fact remains that we are the most affluent and materially prosperous people in the history of civilization.  As Robert Samuelson puts it, "By objective standards, the last half century of our national life has been hugely successful.  We have achieved unprecedented prosperity and personal freedom.  We are healthier, work at less exhausting jobs and live longer than ever."
<P>
But it seems we don't feel so great about it.  Did you know, for example, that the average American now consumes twice as many goods and services as in 1950?  Or that the poorest fifth of the current population consumes more than the average family did in 1955?  In a wonderful introductory essay for the 75th anniversary issue of Forbes magazine, James Michaels put it this way:
<P>
"When you're my age you don't have to ask: Are Americans really materially better off than they were in the recent past?  Those of us born in the 1920s and with vivid memories of the Depression simply know how much better things are today.  The improvement is implicit in almost our every memory, every experience.  Even for comfortable middle-class people life was much more difficult and insecure in the 1920s than it is today.  If he was fortunate enough to have central heating (less than one-third of the population in 1920 did), middle-class Dad had to pull himself from bed at 4 a.m. on cold winter mornings to unbank the furnace and shovel coal; if he overslept, the pipes froze.  But he usually didn't have to rake leaves or shovel snow.  Not in the 1930s.  That was done by shabby, humble men who knocked at the back door mornings, asking for a warm meal in return for doing chores."
<P>
Michaels goes on to say this:  "In 1921... the typical American workweek was 60 hours, and many people worked longer...  [A woman] worked a lot more than 60 hours in her home.  Leisure-time industry scarcely existed because few people had leisure.  For more than half the population, the family toilet was a hole in the backyard with a shack built over it.....  Senior citizens?  We called them old folks, and they were old in their 50s; if they were lucky, one of their kids had a spare room for them, maybe in the attic.  Life expectancy was about 54 years, which was just as well because there were few pensions beyond what the gold watch might bring at a pawnshop."       
<P>
My point is this: while people natter about economics, and it almost consumes many political debates, what I am talking about is not about economics.  It's about whether we can survive prosperity.  Now prosperity and wealth are certainly far preferable to poverty.  But can the human spirit survive it?  The problem is not prosperity per se; the problem is in making prosperity the object of our loves, the object of our heart's and soul's desire, thereby displacing other things.  In this connection think of Saint Augustine, who has the concept called ordo amorum, the "order of the loves."  I think that very often, for very many of us, we have the order wrong.
<P>
Now, if people want to be unhappy and angry and upset and sad, there certainly are plenty of things to be unhappy and sad and angry about.  While America is the most powerful, affluent, and envied nation in the world -- in many ways justifiably so -- America also leads the industrialized world in rates of murder; violent crime; juvenile violent crime; imprisonment; divorce; abortion; sexually-transmitted diseases; single-parent households; teen suicide; cocaine consumption; per capita consumption of all drugs; pornography production and pornography consumption.  I am told that California itself leads the entire world in pornography production.  And that's only a partial list.  Now these are serious matters, worthy of serious concern.  But these are not -- I think we can fairly say -- matters that are the consequences of an economic deprivation.  The root cause lies elsewhere.
<P>
Let me digress for a moment.  I do not want to be misunderstood; I don't mean to sound like a Jeremiah one-note.  There is genuine good news in America, and much of it is about things other than economics.  We have seen huge social advances when it comes to women and minorities; opportunity and equality have been extended to those who were once denied them.  We have witnessed extraordinary advances in medicine, in science and in technology in recent times.  Life expectancy has increased more than 20 years during the last six decades.  Studies show that if a person finishes high school, gets married and reaches the age of twenty before having a first child, the odds are less than 1 in 10 that that person will be in poverty.  The American system works: finish high school, get a job, don't get pregnant or get someone pregnant before you finish high school, and you can make it in America.  And of course, last but not least, America prevailed in the "long, twilight struggle" against communism.
<P>
Let me give you some more specific and more recent good news: we have seen what many people thought could not occur: a downturn in crime in New York and Houston -- almost a 40 percent decline in violent crime in New York (which accounts for a lot of the total crime decline in the nation as a whole).  We have seen effective welfare programs in several states across the country.  I must confess I was delighted that my beloved Western Canon of literature has now made it to Hollywood.  Jane Austen is an enormous movie success.  Now it turns out three Henry James novels are coming to the screen.  Can Anna Karenina be far behind?  We are seeing the popularity of shows on the radio and some on television that lift up the human spirit.  We are seeing a flattening out or decrease in some social indicators -- abortion, divorce, crime.  Maybe this will just flatten out at a high plateau.  Or maybe we will see a further decline.
<P>
We are seeing an emerging consensus on the importance of the "values" debate.  As Bill Galston says, 10 or even 5 years ago we would have been arguing about basic facts and basic premises.  That's not the case now.  People understand the importance of values, understand the importance of families.  For men, programs like Promise Keepers are an extraordinary event in American life.  For young women, for girls, my wife's program, Best Friends, is a tremendous success here in the District of Columbia and in other places.  This is extraordinarily important and extraordinarily hopeful.
<P>
Our popular culture campaign involving Joe Lieberman, Sam Nunn and DeLores Tucker, has had success.  People were actually willing to listen and to change some of what is on TV and what is marketed in music.  I think what we are seeing in America today, in many places, is the virus creating its own antibodies.  We are seeing people fighting back with their best, with their eyes and their sights and their standards raised.  And that is very important and very encouraging.
<P>
But the troubles we have remain our troubles; they manifestly have to do not with the pocket book, not with economics, but with the human heart, the human heart at odds with itself. 
It seems to me that almost all contemporary political campaigns miss the mark in terms of what most ails America.  The concerns which the two campaigns most sought to address were economic: things like wage stagnation, fear that our children will not have as much materially as we do, and how do we increase wealth creation.  Making a bigger pie is a fine thing to do.  We should do it, and I am for it.  But it is not everything.  Nor is it even the most important thing. 
<P>
More than ever before -- and thanks largely to affluence, to mass marketing, to television, to the nature of our political discourse, and I say this knowingly, as a Republican, thanks to the unbridled and omnipresent market, to capitalism, we are constantly pushing our children and adults to buy things which they don't need.  We are pushing goods and the idea of life as having things and having experiences.  We are making desires into needs, and as a result we are not living at the center.  We are misreading the essential human condition.  Because if we actually are moral and spiritual beings -- which a lot of us say we are -- then we ought to act in ways which are consonant with that fact, that reality.  But too often, we aren't doing that -- officially, politically, publicly, privately.  We are not living, or advertising, or talking, or even making public policy, as if we are what we profess ourselves to be.  I know often I'm not.  And maybe you're not.  Maybe a lot of us aren't.  And I think that explains, in large part, the cynicism, the anger, the drift, and the deep and pervasive sadness.
<P>
Let me conclude and then open this up to discussion.  And in conclusion, let me borrow briefly from three people who are a lot smarter than I am.  In doing a philosopher's exercise like this, I thought it was advisable for me to draw on people who thought these things through a lot longer and better than I did.  See if you think they hit it closer than what we here in Beltway Central have been obsessing about for so long.
<P>
First Walker Percy, my favorite contemporary novelist.  When asked about what issue most concerned him about the future of America, Percy said this: "Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and is defeated, not by the Communist movement ... but from within by weariness, by boredom, by cynicism, by greed, and in the end, by helplessness before its great problems."
<P>
Second, the great and prophetic Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had this to say: "In the United States the difficulties are not a Minotaur or a dragon -- not imprisonment, not hard labor, death, government harassment and censorship -- but cupidity, boredom, sloppiness, indifference." About the West, Solzhenitsyn said this simple, straightforward sentence: "the spiritual axis of life has grown dim."
 <P>
And finally, Scottish author John Buchan, writing a half-century ago, described the "coming of a too garish age, when life would be lived in the glare of neon lamps and the spirit would find no solitude."  Here is what Buchan wrote about his nightmare world:
<P>
"In such a world everyone would have leisure.  But everyone would be restless, for there would be no spiritual discipline in life...  It would be a feverish, bustling world, self-satisfied and yet malcontent, and under the mask of a riotous life there would be death at the heart.  In the perpetual hurry of life there would be no change of quiet for the soul...  in such a bagman's paradise, where life would be rationalised and padded with every material comfort, there would be little satisfaction for the immortal part of man."
<P>
This sounds right to me.  I'd love to know how it sounds to you.  Thank you very much. 
<P>
<P><HR>
<center><b>QUESTION-AND-ANSWER</B></center> 
<p>
<B>Question:</B>  How will the new Bennett-Nunn commission actually address moral decline -- through studies, surveys, academic papers, hearings, recommendations for legislative actions, exhortations and speeches?  How will you address moral decline?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</b>  All the above (laughter).  It's a commission.  The Commission members are an exceedingly interesting group: Richard Land from the Southern Baptist Convention is one member, and Henry Louis Gates from Harvard is another member, so that gives you a sense of the ideological spread of the group.  I don't want to presume ideology on the part of anybody, but I have a sense there may be differences of opinion between those two, as with others of us.  It will be interesting to tape the conversation.  And the meetings, I believe, are open to the press, so we welcome members of the press to come.
<P>
We'll have witnesses.  We will hear from people about problems and about solutions.  We very much want to profile what works, what's effective.  We want to see programs that address some of the hardest issues in American life and are finding a way to ameliorate them, if not always solve them.  If there are grounds for this anger and this lack of trust and this grousing that seems to be so increasingly prevalent, we want to know what it is.  But if there are grounds for others, as St. Paul says, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, we'll think on those things, too.  And so we will want to do both.
<P>
What Bill Galston has stressed -- and one of the reasons I so much admire Bill Galston and was so sorry to see him leave the Clinton White House -- was that he doesn't think we should speak on these things until we have established an absolutely unassailable factual basis for anything we have to say.  And so I think we will have a solid empirical basis for talking about these things.  These are difficult concepts, and some people might say, what is all this about trust and sadness and all that?   Well, we're going to get a hard empirical basis for it, so people who need that sort of thing to believe it -- who need to touch something before they believe it's there -- will be satisfied.  There will be a lot of social science, I will admit.  You know what one person called social science?  The elaborate demonstration of the obvious by methods that are obscure (laughter.)  
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The National Endowment for the Humanities, at the beginning of the Clinton administration, launched a national conversation on what it means to be an American.  Little has been heard from that since.  Isn't this similar to that you are doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  No, you'll hear from us (laughter).  I don't know what happened to that conversation.  They may still be building toward it.  They may still be footnoting it.  I don't know what happened to the National Endowment for the Humanities conversation.
<P>
I don't think there are too few conversations in American political life.  I don't think anybody can go through campaign season and say, you know, we're not talking enough about politics.  It's that I don't think we have a sufficient number of conversations that are focused on things that I think we ought to focus on.  And what I was trying to do today -- and what we will try to do in the Commission, I think -- is to bring some other kinds of things into the conversation, some of the most important things are not getting talked about.
<P>
<B>Question</B>:  Perhaps you answered your own question, perhaps wealth is at the core of our hollowness.  In short, do we have too much of a good thing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, the philosophers worried about this.  Again, I don't think prosperity per se is the problem, I don't think wealth per se is the problem.  I think the problem is, as I read some of these other people whom I've quoted, is when the pursuit of these things leads to the displacement of other things.  It's when they become the idol, the actual object of the pursuit, rather than simply a way in which one lives.
<P>
Look, one of my arguments with the market is that it makes people think their desires are needs.  And this is a very, very important distinction.  When I was chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first budget we did -- I remember submitting to Congress a huge document -- talking about the "needs" of the humanities community.  Well, as I read through the "needs" of the humanities community, these weren't needs, these were desires.  It's important to make the distinction.  They said, "we need summer seminars in warm climates." (Laughter.)  Well, they wanted summer seminars in warm climates, and I understand that.  Other people get summer seminars in warm climates; why shouldn't professors?  By the way, we took it away from them and gave it to elementary and high school teachers because I thought they were more deserving of summer seminars in warm climates.  But there was the substitution of the word "need" for what was actually the desire.
<P>
Maybe the smartest thing ever said about this was by Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, "Human desires grow with the means of their gratification."  And I think that just turns out to be a truth of human nature.  One of the ironies of this tremendously successful commercial machine which we have made in this country is that we now regard deprivation relatively much higher than we used to.  It's at a much higher threshold.  Consider what people have now and what they regard as deprivation.  The machine is constantly trying to transmute desires into needs, so that we think of those things in that way, and we ratchet ever higher and pursue it ever the more.
<P>
So, unbridled capitalism is a problem.  It may not be a problem for production and for expansion of the economic pie, but it's a problem for human beings.  It's a problem for that whole dimension of things we call the realm of values and human relationships, because it distorts things.
<P>
The other thing to keep in mind is that with the interest in selling, people have now decided to sell by way of philosophy.  You just don't sell a beer or sell a cigar or sell a piece of furniture; you sell a style of life and a philosophy of life.  Now, this is a free country and anybody can practice philosophy.  But when the young are around and are listening, they may take it seriously in the absence of the real stuff.
<P>
For example, when I was growing up I remember the commercial from the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.  It made a tremendous impact on me, and maybe on other people.  It said, "You only go around once in life, so grab for all the gusto you can."  Now Schlitz produces pretty good beer.  I still buy it occasionally.  But I don't buy the philosophy.  How much of that philosophy is getting across?  Now Schlitz might make good beer, but where did they do their philosophy?  How do they know you only go around once in life?  (Laughter.)  I mean, is that part of the brewing process?  This was not a claim about beer.  And if you spend time with undergraduates, you spend time in high school and you talk to young people about life, and what the Good Life is, you will find that what you're hearing very often -- not all the time but very often -- is an echo and a translation through their own internal systems of what they are picking up from the most successful and omnipresent marketing and philosopher's machine ever invented: television.  Television is telling people what to think, and what to believe, and what to feel, and what to buy. And that creates a different view of the world.
<P>
Again, it's a free country.  I'm not even in favor of the v-chip.  I don't want government regulating television; I don't want government legislating about the content of television. I think these are matters best left to individuals.  But what we can't say, it seems to me, is these matters have no consequence; or that television has no consequence; or that advertising has no consequence; or that a relentless market has no consequence.  These things have an enormous consequence.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  More Americans are regular church-goers than in any other developed country. Are you saying that somehow religious organizations are failing to stimulate this spiritual renewal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, I guess I am.  I've looked into this, because it's a very interesting fact, the number of Americans who go to church. The question is what goes on there, what are the consequences, what's the carryover, and what's the impact?
<P>
Maybe the more interesting thing is to see the shift in church-going, the shift from some of the old established Protestant sects, for example, to some of the newer, more evangelical ones. That seems to be a more interesting, a more revealing direction.  Also, there is still an increase, I think, in registrations in the Catholic Church.
<P>
This is the country which in many ways is the nicest, the most generous, the most considerate, the most sensitive to the needs of people in the world and its citizens.  And yet the kinds of things that go on every day in America, cited in my litany, suggest that we're of two minds on this. I don't think that going to church does it any more. I think that for a lot of us -- and again, I put myself in this group, I don't exempt myself from the charges -- I think that sometimes all it amounts to is going to church.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think America's cultural decline is irreversible? And what nation would you point to as historic precedent for such an about-face?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, there is none. There is no precedent. I've found lately -- we've spent a lot of time talking to cultural anthropologists and historians, trying to find a precedent for this. There are so many things going on in America that are unprecedented.  For example, I was reading a book the other day in which Lawrence Stone, formerly at Princeton (I don't know where he is now), points out that we are in entirely uncharted territory in this country in terms of the disintegration of the family.  There has been a relentless assault on marriage as the central cementing institution of society; it has been going on for decades now, and in its place we see the substitution of the idea of individual self-fulfillment with or without commitment.  This is unprecedented, certainly in the West, and we don't know where this goes.
<P>
Nobody's ever done this before; nobody's ever tried to sustain a society with this level of familial disintegration, and we're not sure whether we can or not. I think that the familial disintegration is a corollary of the larger point here -- that is, the focus and the order of the loves.  Because if you regard yourself as, let's say, a moral and spiritual being on the one hand -- and I'm not saying you have to -- but if you say you do, or if on the other hand you're a "Schlitzian" and you believe you only go around once in life and you should grab for all the gusto you can -- well, one thing you can't say is it doesn't matter which you believe.  Because if you believe one or believe the other -- or if you have a foot in both camps, which a lot of us do -- it makes an enormous difference.
<P>
There is no precedent for the United States in so many ways.  I do not think there's any example that's even close.  We could look to Britain, I suppose, in the 19th Century.  Some historians have suggested that you had a kind of revival occurring which changed things.
<P>
If it happens, it will happen on our own terms by our own people. Regeneration comes from within, I'm pretty sure of that.  And the things I cited as grounds for hope I think are very, very important, because if you go through that list -- if you go through Best Friends, if you go through Promise Keepers, if you go through the successful programs in drug treatment, or the successful welfare programs -- I think you find that there's a common basis to many of them. There's something that they are all share, and that is they all tend to raise people sights up, they tend to lift people up, to look beyond where they've been looking. If you want the quick version of my speech, it is that country Western song, "Lookin' for Love in all the Wrong Places."  
<P>
Marvin Olasky has taught us, I think, in this whole discussion of contemporary charity and compassion, that if you're looking at welfare problems, people who have been on welfare generation after generation, if you're looking at people with serious drug problems, alcohol problems, this requires a refocusing of one's life.  It's not simply a matter of getting a job, or getting a message from the government.  It's a matter of refocusing your life, and refocusing your life requires more than the kind of fooling around with the details, messing with the details of bureaucracies and incentives.  I'm for welfare reform, but unless we offer something to people by way of other agencies or institutions for them to focus on, they will fall back. That's why I think the role of churches is so crucial in this whole welfare debate, and indeed beyond the welfare debate.
<P>
But there are people -- I should say this in fairness to some pretty sophisticated literature out there -- there are people who think we are going through a great spiritual reawakening right now in this country.  I don't see it.  There are people who say we are going through it.  It would be nice if it occurred -- provided it was American in tone, provided it was open and tolerant and not vindictive, not authoritarian -- then it would be a good thing. But I'm not sure I see it.  I see all the signs, the interest of people in religion.  I see the New York Times Best Sellers list, and all the books on religion.  I see movies getting quasi-religious. The latest thing in Hollywood seems to me, from what I can tell, is objective immortality. They can't quite say we have souls yet but you may -- you're to be measured by the impact you have on other people's lives.
<P>
It may also be the case, as demographers have pointed out, that this is not a religious revival, this is simply the yuppies turning 50 and getting nervous (laughter.)  After putting the nation through granola and jogging and marijuana and weight machines, they are now going to make us pray because they're approaching 60.  Maybe so.  I don't know for sure.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Does the gap between the richest Americans and the poorest Americans likely affect public discontent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  I think it's very troubling to Americans to see the gap between an overclass and an underclass, to take both ends increase and increase dramatically.  We've got what people have called "cognitive stratification" to a degree we have never had before.  It's always better to be smart, and it's always better to be well-educated, and it's always better to have an economic base.  But the gap now widens because the sheer value of an education; the sheer value of intelligence matters more, in today's complicated world, than it ever did.
<P>
So yes, I think that's troubling.  But the other side of that is the good news.  The other side of that is a society in which we now find that if you play by certain basic minimal rules -- if you graduate from high school, get a job, keep your nose clean, don't have a child before you get out of high school -- the odds that you will succeed in American society increase dramatically.  But you need to observe certain basic rules.
<P>
The problem is -- and I think now there's a lot of agreement among social scientists who have studied poverty -- that poverty is behavioral in nature,  And that's not a different malady -- except when a malady hits the poor, it knocks them out.  When a malady hits the wealthy suburbs, they can absorb it.  I remember when I was "drug czar" and we went to Hollywood and talked about the drug problem.  The people in Hollywood told me that they were not doing drugs any more.  Out in Hollywood, whenever somebody gets a drug problem, they go to the Betty Ford Clinic and they're fine.  Well, when it hits Beverly Hills, people had the money and resources to be able to do that.  But when it hit Watts, it knocked Watts on its ear.  How bad is the earthquake?  Well, how strong is the foundation of the building in which you live?
<P>
It's never good to be poor, it's never good to be without material resources.  But the resources I'm talking about are perhaps the ones that are missing the most across the board, and they raise the question as to whether this country, and the things for which it stands, the hopes it has for itself and its children, can continue without some fairly significant change.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think Bob Dole made a serious mistake in his campaign by stressing the 15-percent tax cut?  What moral and ethical issues should have he raised, beyond just calling President Clinton immoral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, he did more than that.  If you just stand there and say "You're immoral," that's not persuasive, it's not a very good argument, it's not persuasive when one needs to make one's case.  But as I said during the campaign, I think issues of public character and public trust are central to public confidence.
<P>
Look, one of the things that distressed me -- I don't want to make this a political talk -- is that 55 or 60 percent of the people in exit polls said that they didn't have the trust in the president, that they didn't think he was a trustworthy person.  Mario Cuomo said, well, if that's what they thought of Clinton, then what did they think of Dole, if Clinton got elected?  Well, I guess in some ways less, in terms of electability.  But that's not good, that's the point I would make.
<P>
It's perfectly fine to talk about a 15-percent tax cut if that's what you truly believe is essential to the well-being of the country and will spark an economic recovery.  I have no objection to it.  Other things can be talked about and were talked about -- the drug problem, the education problem.  But let me make two points: first, we could be more explicit and talk about real-life issues in ways that are broader than we usually talk about it.  For example, talk about education not just about SAT scores, but talk about education as the architecture of the soul, which is how we used to talk about it, and which why I think many schools are so successful and others are not.  Some schools address students as moral and spiritual beings, and that makes a difference.  I think that helps, when it's done by people who genuinely care for the children.
<P>
We can talk about welfare as life-refocusing effort.  And we can talk about crime as arising not from what I think the usual root-cause argument is but, as we argue in Body Count, the root cause of most crime is moral poverty, kids who are not taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age.  When I traveled as drug czar and talked to wardens and police chiefs and judges, this is what we heard over and over again: nobody's teaching these kids the basics of right and wrong.  Now that's an interesting way to talk about crime, and we could do that.
<P>
Now sure, we could all broaden and deepen our debates in this way.  But at the end of the day, it's not a matter of saying to politicians, "Take all this stuff about the soul and right and wrong and put all that into your political speeches and your political debates."  The point is about the limits of politics itself.  We can't get where we need to get by politics.  The secularization of so much of what matters to us has become so complete that we think of politics as the vehicle of national self-recovery.  And it is not.
<P>
Samuel Johnson said, in his great lines, "How small of all that human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause or cure."  And I think that's right.  But we have now, unwittingly, created a situation in which people are unhappy and so the government needs to do something about it, the president needs to do something about it.  Of course, they can't do something about those things which laws or kings can't cause or cure.  And so we have gotten into a cycle of frustration and unhappiness.
<P>
It is the limits of politics.  It is not as if I'm saying we need to step forward and transform American politics and get into all these things more explicitly.  Politics is a very limited activity, if you think of men and women in the ways that I have been talking about.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  As the story goes, when Bob Dole queried you about interest in running for vice president, you suggested Jack Kemp.  Why didn't you want to run?  Is that because of the limitations of politics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Because of the limitations of politics, plus my own.  And I thought Dole-Kemp would be a better ticket.  I thought it would have more lift than Dole-Bennett.  And there were other reasons.  Yeah, I thought Dole-Kemp was a good idea, and that was my recommendation.
<P>
I did not grow up in the soil of politics.  A thought that has occurred to me recently that to run for president in our time one needs to be obsessed with running for president, and I do not have that, I don't seek it.  I don't come from that soil.  I don't think this is something I will do.  And my relationship with campaigns has always been a little bumptious, a little difficult.  It's never a smooth fit.  So, yeah, I made that recommendation in good conscience, and I thought it was the best call at the time.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think the world of the Internet is helping to form caring communities by linking people beyond their geographic boundaries, or isolating them from person-to-person contact?  If the latter, what as a society can we do about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>   I don't know.  I'm no expert on the Internet.  But I'll tell you it seems to me to be a very mixed blessing.  I read that chilling New York Times story.  It was about a little town in Minnesota and about this network on the Internet on a topic I don't want to get into -- one of the worst and most grisly aspects of American life.  The Internet has made it possible for lots of really horrible things to happen, and it's made it possible for lots of obviously wonderful things to happen.  Here, again, the technology outruns or outpaces the ability to legislate against it, to regulate it, to keep control of it.  What's important are internal constraints, a sense of responsibility, a sense of involvement, participation on the part of parents and others.  I don't know where this is going to lead, but we are going to have a big debate on this.  It's a very mixed blessing indeed.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  California voters recently passed Proposition 209 which ends affirmative action and racial and gender preferences in government and public education.  Do you back this as a national improvement?  And do you believe this would be appropriate for federal hiring programs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Yes, I was a supporter of Prop. 209 and went out there a few times, campaigned for it.  And I think it is one of the more interesting consequences of the elections.  It does not end affirmative action.  What it ends is preference by race or gender in hiring and in college admissions and so on.  And I think that's right.  I think finally there is only one way to live in this society, which is to lift the burdens of discrimination from the shoulders of every man, woman, and child in the country, and to have a level playing field, and to give opportunity where opportunity hasn't been given before.  And I think this is the way to go.
<P>
Yes, I would like to see it on the federal level.  And I am very encouraged, as I think other Americas should be, by the results of the recent election in which when those redistricted districts were redistricted once more, and black members of Congress, incumbents who were now running in majority white districts, were still elected.  It was encouraging for this reason: it shows that the American people, the vast majority of them, can look past race and want to look past race.  And I would hope that Proposition 209 will be given a sympathetic hearing across the country and a full discussion.  I hope that this issue, like so many other important issues, doesn't get decided for us by the courts.  The courts must enter if they think it appropriate.   But these are vital issues of democracy, and people must be encouraged and invited to speak.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The rise of dual-income families explains some of the affluence you describe.  Is there an antidote that would give parents more time with their children to impart values?  What do you propose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  It really all depends. Some people say that two parents have to work to keep body and soul together.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes two parents work to keep the boat together -- you know, the boat for the summer vacation.  You pay your money, you take your choice.
<P>
The two statistics I am still trying to get together are the one that says people, the average American adult, has very little time to spend with his family and with his children because of the demands of work with the statistic that tells us the average American adult watches 21 hours of television a week.  Now, it seems to me that if it's as easy as that we can just answer what people ought to do: turn off the TV -- at least during the week -- and check the homework or something.  But this is a matter of people's priorities.  As I've said, it's a free country and people can do what they want.  But every parent -- and I'm a parent -- knows that how you spend your time and where you spend your time has consequences for your children.
<P>
Years ago there was this nice idea of quality time.  "Quality time" is all you need.  Well, maybe there's something true about quality time, but you don't know when it is, and you've got to log a lot of quantity time in order to get the right quality time, because you can't say to your son, "This is our time, buddy.  We're together now for two hours -- what's on your mind?"  It may turn out there isn't anything on his mind.  Then there's some other time he wants it, and it's nice if you were there as opposed to not being there.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How to you feel about your regular appearances on CNN's "Late Edition" with Mario Cuomo?  Is there any convergence of liberal and conservative ideas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Oh yeah.  I think he would agree with a lot of this.  Yes, we had some good moments.  One of the reasons I like Governor Cuomo is he's a liberal and he's not embarrassed to be a liberal.  He and Paul Wellstone, you know, "Here we are, we are liberals, we can do no other."  I don't agree with them, but I admire their guts, because it's two versus everybody in the Republican Party, and virtually everybody in the Democratic Party.  Today liberal is an epithet, and people run from it.  You know, if you call somebody a conservative they say, "Thank you, come to dinner."  But if you call somebody a liberal, they say, "Not me" -- unless you're Paul Wellstone or Mario Cuomo.  So I admire that.
<P>
The other things is we have somewhat similar backgrounds -- two New York Catholics -- although he has pushed that a bit far.  During one of the CNN shows I answered, then he answered, and then he said to Frank Sesno, "What you had in our two answers is the respective perspectives of the Dominicans and the Jesuits."  And that's not good TV.  That is not good talking-head journalism (laughter).  Thank you.<br>

<p><br><p><br><br><blockquote>
Dear Friend:
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to give you information about <I><B>Empower America</B></I> and our ongoing internship program. 
<P>
<B><I>Empower America</I></B> is a conservative non-profit grass-roots advocacy organization.  We were founded on three main principles which include the beliefs of democratic capitalism, economic growth through entrepreneurship, job creation, lower taxes, sound money, less government regulation, and developing new approaches to cultural and social issues.
<P>
We conduct extensive research into public policy and laws that are being made in Congress.  With this valuable information, we then take positions on the issues.  At that point, we begin to educate our membership on the details of the current policy topic and our positions, and encourage them to become involved in the political process.  We have worked on such issues as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Welfare and Healthcare reform, the California School Choice Initiative and the Washington "Three Strikes Your Out" initiative, to name a few.
<P>
The internship program consists of "hands on" working experience with a leading national grass-roots organization.  We also invite leaders from the political community to participate in our internship program's speakers series which focuses on current government and political issues of the day.  Educational tours of federal and historical buildings will be provided, as well.  This is an exciting, interesting, and educational internship for any college student.
<P>
If you have any questions, or would like to apply, please contact me at (202) 452-8200 or write me at:

<BR>
<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="/empower/ea2.jpe" align="left" alt="Jeane J. Kirkpatrick"</CENTER>


	Scholar, diplomat, syndicated columnist, political scientist, Jeane Kirkpatrick is one of America's few true experts on world politics and international affairs.  Kirkpatrick speaks and writes with clarity and sophistication about the politics of many issues, areas, countries, and organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick's first hand experience in the United Nations and as a member of the U.S. Cabinet and National Security Council gives her an unusual understanding of the dynamics of global politics.  A lifetime of study gives her analyses unusual depth and breadth.  She knows world leaders personally and understands them in their institutions.

	<P>During her years as United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as a member of Ronald Reagan's cabinet, Jeane Kirkpatrick had a remarkable impact in the United States and in the world body.  Her stature has not diminished since she left that office.  Her strong voice and keen mind, her analyses and opinions are sought on a wide range of international and geopolitical questions.

	<P>Today, Dr. Kirkpatrick is Leaving Professor at Georgetown University, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Co-Director of Empower America, and author of a syndicated column on world affairs.

	<P>She is the author of seven books, several monographs and a large number of substantial articles on American political issues and foreign policy that appear in such journals as Commentary, Foreign Affairs, and The National Interest.

	<P>Her most recent book, The Withering Away of the Totalitarian State, describes the collapse of Communism and the end of the Cold War.  Other books include Legitimacy and Force (two volumes), Dictatorships and Double Standards, The Reagan Phenomenon, The New Presidential Elite, a pace-making study of American presidential nominating politics, Dismantling the Parties, Political Woman, a trail-blazing study of women in public life, and a book-length study of the Peronist movement in Argentina, Leader and Vanguard in Mass Society:  A Study of Peronist Argentina.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has lectured extensively in the United States and abroad.  She has also participated in programs of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and the Department of State in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

	<P>A noted academic, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick holds undergraduate degrees from Stephens College and Barnard College, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University.  She has studied at the University of Paris.  Dr. Kirkpatrick has been awarded more than a dozen honorary doctor degrees including degrees form the University of Michigan, Georgetown University, St. John's University, the Hebrew University (Jerusalem), and Tel Aviv University.  She has received research grants from a number of leading foundations.  

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was awarded the Medal of Freedom (the highest civilian award given by the U.S. government), and the French Prize Politique for political courage.  She is also the recipient of the award of the Commonwealth Fund, the Gold Medal, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Hubert H. Humphrey Award of the American Political Science Association, the Gold Medal of the Nicholas Society, the Christian A. Herter Award of the Boston World Affairs Association, the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award, the Humanitarian Award of B'nai B'rith, the Defender of Jerusalem Award, and, most recently, a second Distinguished Public Service Medal awarded in December 1992 (the highest civilian award given by the Department of Defense).

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has been active in professional organizations, including the American and International Political Science Associations, and she has served as a board member on numerous academic, public affairs, and public service organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was born in Duncan, Oklahoma.  She is married to Dr. Evron M. Kirkpatrick.  They have three grown sons.  In addition to English, she speaks French and Spanish and travels widely.

<title>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
May 1995<p>
 
<center>
<h2>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating 
Chief Economist 
Small Business Survival Committee
</center><p>
<hr>
 
<i>"Upward mobility is what America is all about, and the ability to access and accumulate capital -- an ability undermined by the capital gainst tax -- is the stairway by which people move up."</i><p>
<p>
--Jack Kemp, The Washington Time, 5/2/95<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Experience indicates that lower capital gains taxes have a positive impace on federal revenues.  The most 
impressive evidence involves the period from 1978 to 1985.  During those years the marginal federal tax 
rate on capital gains was cut from almost 50 percent to 20 percent -- but total individual capital gains tax 
receipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion."</i><p>
<p>
--American Council for Capital Formation, January 1995<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	In 1989, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) single-handedly killed a capital gains tax cut.  Mitchell's dedication to class warfare and blind-eye towards the benefits for all capital -- income levels from capital gains tax reduction cost the economy untold growth and opportunity -- businesses that were never created or expanded, new jobs never added to the economy, and products and services never made available to consumers.<p>

	President George Bush refused to make another serious push for capital gains tax reduction.  
Indeed, he sacrificed his no-new-taxes pledge and ultimately his presidency the following year by signing 
on to a deficit reduction package that raised taxes, failed to actually cut spending, and didn't reduce the 
deficit.<p>

	Today we have a new Congress looking to do buisness in a new way.  the House of 
Representatives has passed a tax cut package -- including capital gains tax rate reduction (top rate of 19.8 percent for individuals and 25 percent for corporations) and indexing gains for inflation.  Indexing capital gains and reducing the capital gains tax rate was by far the most pro-growth plank in the House 
Republicans' "Contract with America."  For the small buisness, entrepreneurial sector of the economy, 
capital gains tax reduction means greater access to capital for investment and growth.  If America truly has a new Senate in 1995, then the mistakes of 1989 will not be repeated and capital gains tax reduction will be enacted.<p>

<b>Tax Cuts for Growth and Spending Cuts for Deficit Reduction</b> However, some Senators seem to be unable to grasp the concept that cutting taxes and reducing the deficit can be achieved simultaneously.  Many claim such actions to be contradictory.  They are not.  The supply-side economics concept of "policy levers" can help to make this clearer.<p>

	Briefly, the policy lever concept states that policies should directed at the area of the economy where they hold a comparative advantage.  For example, the lone goal of monetary policy, or the monetary lever, should be to achieve price stability.  Meanwhile, the fiscal lever should be geared toward promoting economic growth by enhancing incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.  Misunderstanding how the economy works, old-line Keynesian economists claim that such actions are contradictory.  Yet, tight money and tax cuts in the 1980s cured stagflation and placed the U.S. economy on a robust growth path.<p>
 
	Likewise, the concept of policy levers can help us with the current dilemma regarding tax cuts and the deficit.  As noted, the fiscal lever should be positioned to promote growth.  Therefore, reducing capital gains tax rates and indexing returns for inflation makes sense -- i.e., the tax lever should be moved in a pro-growth direction.  Meanwhile, the spending lever should then be adjusted so as to deal with the deficit.  Quite simply, if the fiscal lever is going to promote economic growth, then taxes must be cut and deficits dealt with through spending cuts.<p>
 
	Tax increases only work to slow economic growth, thereby boosting government spending, 
shrinking the tax base, and actually expanding the deficit.  Meanwhile, pro-growth tax cuts along with 
spending restraint amount to the most sensible fiscal policy -- the combination of a growing economy, an expanding tax base, and prudent spending policies will shrink the deficit.<p>
 
	Tax cuts and deficit reduction do not have to be mutually exclusive.  The formula for sound fiscal policy is clear: tax cuts for economic growth and spending cuts for deficit reduction.<p>
 
<b>Boosting Entrepreneurship.</b>  Make no mistake, shifting tax policy into a growth mode through capital gains tax rate reduction and indexing, while reducing government spending, will serve to boost the small business, entrepreneurial sector of the economy -- where job creation occurs.  Indeed, considering that access to capital remains probably the biggest obstacle for small business and entrepreneurs, it is difficult to think of a more damaging levy to small business than the capital gains tax.  Entrepreneurs need capital to start up new businesses, to expand existing enterprises, and to create jobs.</p>
 
	<i>In effect, capital gains tax reduction is the best "jobs program" government can institute.</i>
 
	If the Senate wants to ensure that entrepreneurs gain access to capital, then it will:  
 
<ul>

<li>Reduce the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent on individuals, as the House did (the 
corporate rate on capital gains would drop to 25 percent); 

<li>Index gains for inflation.  Unfortunately, the House tax cut only allows for indexing from the 
beginning of 1995, no matter when the asset was acquired.  The Senate should provide for full indexing for inflation from the time the asset actually was acquired, and insist on this in joint conference with the 
House.  Full indexing would unlock trillions of dollars of capital for investment in new and expanding 
businesses.
</ul>
<p>
	In the end, however, Congress should shift the fiscal policy lever into full growth mode by 
eliminating capital gains taxes altogether.<p>

<title>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</title>

<h2>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>"History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy."</i><p>

-- Sydney Hoff-Hay, SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 1/26/95.<p>


<i>"While I fully support the elimination of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation ... in the Contract With America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business expansions."</i><p>

-- Richard Rahn, Ph.D., SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 2/22/95.<p>


<i>"As long as risk-taking is punished, growth will be smothered.... I genuinely believe we will open the 21st century without a tax on capital gains, as we opened the 20th century."</i><p>

--Jude Wanniski, economist, before the U.S. Senate, 2/15/95.<p>
<hr>

	Much-needed capital gains tax reduction has been placed on hold since then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell almost single-handedly killed it in 1989. During the 1992 campaign, thenpresidential candidate Bill Clinton mentioned the possibility of indexing capital gains for inflation. Nevertheless, President Clinton has voiced opposition to capital gains tax reduction.<p>

Finally, the House Republican "Contract With America" called for significant capital gains tax reduction -- a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from taxation, effectively dropping the top tax rate for individuals from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and prospective indexing for inflation. At a minimum, <i>the Small Business Survival Committee supports the Houseplanfor capital gains tax reduction, but urges the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.</i><p>

Our bold stance on the capital gains front is based on the facts, which are so often left out of the capital gains tax debate:<p>

<b>Improved Incentives for Investment and Entrepreneurship.</b> Investment and entrepreneurship are the driving forces behind economic growth and job creation. The economy needs individuals who are willing to undertake the great risks of investing sweat and/or capital in new and expanding businesses -- cssentially in new ideas.<p>

	Capital gains taxes raise the costs of such enterprises -reducing potential returns, and thereby reducing risk taking, investment, and economic growth. <i>Basic economics tells us that cutting or eliminaneg the capital-gains tax will enhance incentivesfor investment and entrepreneurship.</i><p>

<b>Widespread Benefits.</b> Critics of capital gains tax reduction illustrate great ignorance when asserting that a capital gains tax cut "will only benefft the rich."<p>

	<i>First</i>, improving incentives for investment and entrepreneurship has widespread economic benefits -- greater competition, more products and services for consumers, greater economic growth, and <i>more jobs</i>. After all, employees need employers. Providing incentives for individuals to expand existing businesses or to create new enterprises is the engine of job creation.  Absurdly, critics seem to think that individuals and the economy somehow benefit from taking resources away from venture capitalists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and giving it to the government.  <i>The problem remains that while government can redistribute, and even destroy, it cannot create</i>.<p>

	Second, capital gains are spread across a wide income spectrum.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, 73 percent of returns with capital gains were from incomes of less than $75,000, while incomes of less than $100,000 claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

	Third, any discussion of which income levels derive direct benefits from capital gains tax reduction will be misleading because capital gains are included in the measurement of income.  Therefore, individuals who perhaps claim one-time or very infrequent capital gains income can be launched into a considerably higher income bracket <i>for only the year in which the capital gain is claimed</i>.  Opponents of capital gains tax cuts misleadingly claim that the rich capture the benefits of tax cuts without mentioning the facts about income measurement.<p>

	<i>Fourth</i>, even if <i>all</i> the direct benefits of capital gains tax reduction accrued to the "rich" -- which they do not -- one must ask: Who possesses better incentives to invest money more wisely, a rich person investing his own money or a government bureaucrat spending the taxpayers' money?<p>

<b>Double Taxation</b>.  Capital gains taxes represent a form of double taxation,  Individuals pay taxes on income they earn, and then choose to either save, invest, or consume their after-tax dollars.  The federal government does not tax consumption, but certainly does tax the benefits of saving and investing.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes, as well as taxes on interest earned from saving, alleviates the bias against saving and investment</i>.<p>

<b>Equalizing Tax Treatment of Capital Gains with Government Debt</b>.  Interest on most state and local government debt instruments are not subject to federal taxation, while capital gains are taxed.  This tax structure makes no economic sense.  Government securities present few risks for investors, while investments in private-sector equities, business expansion, and new enterprises offer considerable risks.  In addition, government debt generally finances rather unproductive government projects and programs, while capital gains are generated by successful private-sector enterprises that boost the economy, expand the tax base, and create real jobs.  <i>Clearly, capital gains income should receive the same tax treatment as interest on state and local government debt</i>.<p>

<b>Capital Gains Tax Reduction and Federal Tax Revenues</b>.  Static government analyses project revenue losses from capital gains tax reduction.  However, as the top tax rate on capital gains declined from almost 50 percent to 20 percent between 1978 and 1985, capital gains tax receipts <i>increased</i> from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  In contrast, the 1986 Tax Reform Act hiked the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent -- from 20 percent to 28 percent -- but by 1992 capital gains tax revenues registered about the same amount as were collected in 1985 (far less in real terms).  Naturally, the increase in the capital gains tax rate resulted in far lower capital gains realizations.<p>

	After all, the economy is dynamic, not static.  Therefore, individuals will alter their economic behavior according to the incentives established by governmental policies.  Even the complete elimination of capital gains taxes on individuals does not mean that the federal government will lose all of the $26 billion or so it collects from this levy because investment and entrepreneurship will respond positively, spurring growth and creating revenue feedback for the federal government through other levies.<p>

<b>International Treatment of Capital Gains</b>.  Most of our top international competitors -- including Japan and Germany -- do not tax capital gains as harshly as the U.S. does.  In fact, <i>nations like Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany do not tax capital gains income at all</i>.<p>

	Even nations like Great Britain and Australia who tax capital gains at 40 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively -- higher rates than the U.S. -- adjust asset prices for inflation.  Once inflation is factored into the equation, the <i>real</i> U.S. capital gains tax rate jumps much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent -- often well in excess of 50 percent.  In fact, many U.S. taxpayers wind up paying taxes on <i>real</i> capital losses.<p>

	In addition, most states and some cities levy their own capital gains taxes -- pushing the total capital gains tax rate even higher.<p>

<b>Unlocking Past Gains and Improving Economic Efficiency</b>.  Literally trillions of dollars are locked into investments at present because high tax rates, especially after adjusting for inflation, create significant disincentives for investors to sell.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes would unlock huge amounts of capital -- that are artificially locked in because of current tax treatment of capital gains income -- to be reinvested in new and growing ventures</i>.

	When one moves past the class warfare rhetoric and nonsensical arguments against capital gains tax reduction, the economics are clear.  <i>Sharply reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes increases potential returns on investment and entrepreneurship, thereby promoting economic growth and job creation</i>.

<h2>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of</h2>
<h2>Family Businesses: Repeal the Estate Tax</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<i>"Interestingly, for a tax that is supposed to inflict such little pain, people have devoted a great deal of ingenuit to getting around [the estate tax]."</i><p>

-- Economist Bruce Bartlett in his book  Reaganomics<p>


<i>"The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is domiciled elsewhere."</i><p>

--Robert Lenzner and Phillippe Mao, "The New Refugees," Forbes 11/221/94<p>


<i>"It's basically cheaper to give away a business than to die owning it."</i><p>

--Frank Rainaldi quoted Investor's Buisness Daily, 4/12/95<p>
<hr>

	At various points in the history of modern-day capitalism, concerns have been raised regarding hostile takeovers of business entities.  Worries over general corporate instability, excessive debt, and job losses often arise when an individual or firm attempts seize the reins of a corporation against the wishes of current management.  In fact, though, hostile takeovers remain a source of dynamism in a free enterprise system -- often removing moribund, inefficient management, finding ways to add value and increase production, and boosting the economy.<p>

	<i>One kind of hostile takeover distinctly anti-free enterprise, though, and worthy of harsh criticism is the federal estate tax, along with the gift and generation-skipping taxes.</i>  After working hard, paying taxes, and establishing a business over a lifetime, thegovernment moves in to claim up to 60 percent of an individual's assets upon death -- a hostile takeover, if you will.  And a target for government raiders under the guise of the estate tax are family businesses.<p>

<b>Insurance to Pay Taxes.</b>  To fend off such government takeovers, family business owners channel large amounts of resources into relatively unproductive endeavors in order to pass business on to the next generation.  Legions of accountants explore creative ways to shield assets from death taxes.  Indeed, individuals may purchase life insurance for the sole purpose of paying estate taxes. Insurance is not cheap, however, and remains out of reach for many individuals working hard to keep their businesses afloat, or if purchased, diverts resources away from productive investment.  A clear indication of a tax system gone awry is when insurance is being bought to cover the costs of taxation.<p>

<b>Killing Businesses.</b>  Most often, the need to pay estate taxes winds up killing family-owned businesses.  In fact, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  Estate taxes in play a significant role in this development.  Perhaps most detrimental is the fact that the government is stripping a company of much-needed capital at the worst possible juncture -- under a change of ownership and oversight. Most businesses simply never recover.<p>

	Heavy estate taxation also acts as a disincentive for investment and entrepreneurship, just as onerous income and capital gains taxes do.  With 55 percent of a business enterprise essentially slated for a government takeover, there remains little incentive for individuals to continue to invest and expand a family business when the owner reaches a certain age.  Rather, business owners possess every incentive to sell their family businesses before death to spare their heirs the costs and burdens of a hostile government takeover via estate taxes.<p>

<b>Tax Rates.</b>  Federal estate tax rates range effectively from 37 percent up to 55 percent, plus an additional 5 percent on very large estates.  <i>It is important to understand the fact that this is not 55 percent of income, it is 55 percent of all assets in an estate.</i>  The first $600,000 is exempt from taxation.  (The Contract with America proposal, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, increases the estate tax exemption to $750,000.)<p>

	The gift tax is levied at the same rates as the estate tax, excluding $10,000 per recipient annually.  In addition, a generation-skipping tax is imposed on gifts and bequests to grandchildren.  The generation-skipping tax is levied at an additional, flat rate of 55 percent on amounts in excess of $1 million.<p>

<b>Tax Revenues.</b>  As is always the case when government pushes tax rates too high, tax revenues are relatively insignificant.  As already noted, high estate tax rates intensify tax avoidance efforts and create disincentives for investment, saving, and entrepreneurship.  <i>In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted for a mere 1.2 percent of total federal government receipts, or $15.2 billion.  Between 1974 and 1994, there has been virtually no inflation-adjusted increase in federal estate and gift tax revenues (only a 0.6 percent increase).</i>  In addition, a good portion of these revenues are eaten up by the federal government's compliance efforts related to estate and other death taxes -- some estimates say as much as 75 percent of estate and gift tax collections are offset by the costs of the IRS, the Treasury Department, and litigation.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

<b>Economic Growth and Job Creation.</b>  In the 1970s, Australia and Canada repealed their estate taxes.  While not exactly bastions of free-market economics, both these nations came to realize that estate levies were hurting investment, economic growth and job creation.

	In the most extreme cases, the U.S. tax structure has pushed many upper-income individuals to reject their citizenship, taking up official residence in less-taxing lands.  Again, estate taxes play a major part in such decisions.  <i>Forbes</i> magazine ran a cover story about such individuals entitled "The New Refugees" in its November 21, 1994 issue.  While some might say, "Good riddance to such traitors," the economics underlying the situation should be reviewed.<p>

	A simple question arises: Why does the U.S. impose such a punitive tax code to the point where productive individuals will take the dramatic step of renouncing their citizenship in order to prosper elsewhere? Though the problem of taxing productive individuals out of a country is not new one.  In the late eighteenth century, the great economist Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:

	<blockquote>"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.  He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.  By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left."</blockquote>

This observation takes on even greater significance considering today's worldwide competition for increasingly mobile capital -- made even more mobile through global electronic transfers of funds.<p>

	A 1993 study by the Center for the Study of Taxation estimated the economic impact of repealing estate taxes in the United States.  The study estimated that under a no-estate-tax scenario by the year 2000, GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000 more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and capital would accumulate.<p>

<b>End Government Hostile Takeovers.</b>  In the private sector, a hostile takeover often means that the owners (i.e., shareholders) of the targeted company will benefit as their shares in the firm increase in price.  Under the government's hostile takeovers of thousands of family-owned businesses each year via the estate and other death taxes, heirs are decimated as the government often lays claim to more than half the company's assets.  Resources are funneled away from productive, private-sector ventures to often-dubious, unproductive government programs.<p>

	The only justification for estate taxes is envy -- a desire to perpetuate class warfare and worn-out, failed government redistribution schemes.  But as we all know, envy is a poor foundation upon which to base a tax code.  Sound economics is preferable.  The economics of estate taxes tells us that such levies create disincentives to invest, save, and take risks; reduce economic growth and job creation; and are expensive to administer. The time has come to repeal the estate and other death taxes in the United States.  Government's hostile takeovers of family businesses and assets must come to an end.  If not, the government will continue to destroy America's free enterprise system and our great heritage of family-owned businesses.<p>

<h2>Competition and Common Sense:</h2>
<h2>The Two Essential Ingredients for Constructive</h2>
<h2>Health Care Reform</h2>

By Raymond J. Keating
</center>
<hr>

<i>"Anyone familiar with my career in public service knows I strongly favor the social goals of relieving poverty and enhancing the quality of life for all people.  Not one American should be denied access to health care.  But in trying to collect the costs from business, we assume every employer can effectively play a national version of the street corner shell game, with the consumer paying the bill.  But consumers have choices and some businesses have real limitations on what they can charge for products or services.  When government is unmindful of these dynamics, it often means loss of employment for those we seek to help."<p>
</i>
--George McGovern, Insight, 4/26/93<p>


<i>"According to ... the CATO Institute, MSAs would lower the nation's annual health care bill by $33 billion"</i><p>

--National Center for Policy Analysis, Health Care Briefing Book<p>

<hr>

	The misguided effort by President and Mrs. Clinton to further inject government into the U.S. health care system thankfully died in 1994.  However, the underlying struture that makes health care so costly still lives on -- i.e., an expanded definition of "insurance," the prevailing use of third-party payments, and government regulations which prevent innovative methods for making health care affordable and accessible.  in addition, self-employed entrepreneurs and uninsured individuals are not given equal tax treatment in terms of their health care expenditures as is received by employer-based insurance plans.<p>

	In order to control costs, increase choices, and further enhance quality, <i>market-based</i> health care reforms are needed.  The byer-seller relationsh8ip between consumers and suppliers of health care services needs to be re-established.  Under a thrd-party system of payments, neither consumer nor provider have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.<p>

	There are two veins to thise thrid-party payment system.  First, government involvement in the health care market has increased, especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960s.  Second, the concept of "insurance" has been vastly expanded. By definition, insurance is supposd to cover  catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predictable expenses.  Such a perversion of health insurance would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the law, trimming and painting the house.<p>

	Make no mistakes, third-party payments have increased dramatically over the past three decades.  For example, according to economist Ed Rebenstein in his book <i>Right Data</i>, in 1950 government fianced 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percentcovered out of pocket.  As of 1965, government's share had risen to 26.2 percent, private insurance rose to 28.1 percent, while out-of-pocket fiancing fell to 45.7 percent.  By 1990, government fianced health care expenditures reached 42.4 percent, private insurance hit 37.2 percent, with out-of-pocket fiancing falling to a mere 20.4 percent.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> 1994, in 1991, government fianced expenditures equaled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and 19.2 percent out of pocket.<p>

	The effect of this usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been clear -- rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditures between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer price index of 332 percent.<p>

	The Small Business Survival Committee believes that two reform measures by the 104th Congress and the Administration would go a long way in curing what ails the health care marketplace.<p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts.</b> Incentives need to be established so that individuals can save to cover the costs of standard, predictable health care expenses out of pocket, while also purchasing catastrophic health care insurance.  Allowing individuals to establish tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) would provide the basis for such a system.<p>

	The most common MSA scenario would have employers and employees shifting payments from a standard health plan to a split system of an MSA and a catastrophic plan.  For example, a standard plan costing $5,000 could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA ($2,500 from the employer and $500 from the employee) and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.<p>

	The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he does not use by the end of the year, the employee has an incentive to spend more prudently and comparison shop for health care purchases.  After all, <i>the critical issue in making health care more accessible is to make it more affordable.</i>  If consumers become more concerned with costs, health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services.<p>

	Also, many individuals would be able to build up a large amount of savings in their MSAs, which in turn would help offset health care costs in case the employee lost his job.  Such a plan could be designed to help the poor as well -- eventually replacing Medicaid, and its daunting bureaucracy and costs, with health care vouchers that could be deposited in MSAs.  Again, this would go a long way in helping to alleviate some of the high costs associated with third-party payers, in the case of Medicaid, the government.<p>

	In places where MSA plans already are being tried, the results have been quite positive.  For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>A recent study (January 11, 1995) by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington reviewed MSA plans currently in use.  They found that the use of MSAs generated "reduced health care spending by sponsors/employers and employees; wiser use of health services by consumers; greater use of preventive services; increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; dollar savings and improved choice for healthy and ill people; MSA preference by low-income employees; [and] strong employee participation and satisfaction."

<li>Also, the Evergreen report noted that the MSA plan instituted by Forbes, Inc. has reduced insurance premiums by 27 percent since 1991.

<li>According to a survey by The Luntz Research Companies, 98 percent of the employees at Golden Rule Insurance (Indianapolis, Indiana) enrolled in the companyÕs MSA plan are satisfied with the program.  Ninety percent of Golden RuleÕs employees have chosen to enroll in the plan, with the average enrollee accumulating $1,002 in refunds in 1994.  About half of those receiving refunds planned to spend the money on living expenses, holiday gifts and other items, while the other half planned on keeping their money in an interest-bearing MSA reserve account or investing the money in other ways.  Total employee refunds for 1993 and 1994 amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition, for the second straight year using MSAs, Golden Rule has had no rate increase.
</ul><p>

<b>Equalized Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenditures for the Self-Employed and Uninsured.</b>  The current tax system allows full tax deductibility for employer-provided health insurance, but denies such treatment to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and self-employed individuals.  In order to ensure that individuals and entrepreneurs can afford health care, their health care expenses -- whether for insurance or out-of-pocket payments -- should be allowed full tax deductibility.<p>

	The current system of only allowing full tax deductibility for employer-provided insurance benefits larger companies and their employees, leaving entrepreneurs and uninsured workers behind.  Extending 100-percent deductibility to entrepreneurs merely levels the playing field.  In turn, full deductibility may help to foster entrepreneurship.  Many individuals are unwilling to undertake the risks of starting a new business because once they leave the security of being an employee in an established firm, they may lose health care benefits.  Allowing for 100-percent deductibility would give an added incentive for individuals to start their own businesses.<p>

	Unbelievably, Congress and the Administration even allowed the 25-percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed to expire last year.  As a first step, Congress should reinstate this 25-percent deduction immediately (which will still require many individuals to file amended tax returns), and then phase in the 100-percent deduction.<p>

	
	MSAs and full tax deductibility for individuals and entrepreneurs are the kind of market-oriented health care reform measures that will provide greater access to care, enhanced choice for health care consumers, while providing incentives to control costs.  Health care reform may be the arena where the degree of real change brought about by this past election will be measured.  In fact, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tx.) is expected to introduce a bill shortly that will include MSAs.<p>

	A government-driven health care plan is one of a primary reason that the Clinton Administration is taking on water.  Market-driven health care reforms could buoy the new Congress.<p>

<title>Jacobs:  The Trap of "Entitlement" Thinking -- PFF</title>

<h2>The Trap of 'Entitlement' Thinking</h2>
 By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center><P>
If we are serious about tackling a problem that is leading our
country into ruinous debt, perhaps the best way to begin is by
redefining our terms.
<P>
Every responsible person in Washington - from President Clinton
to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and on down - now recognizes
that reining in the high costs of government means dealing with
the escalating costs of so-called &quot;entitlement&quot; programs.
<P>
Do Americans have a &quot;right&quot; to a certain standard of
living? Are they &quot;entitled&quot; to money earned by other
people? Does our society owe people happiness? Certainly we should
not let people starve. We should be charitable. But the difference
between charity and entitlement is vast.
<P>
For a generation, entitlements have been the &quot;untouchable&quot;
part of the federal budget - never subject to elimination, cuts
or even critical performance review, but automatically scheduled
for cost-of-living increases and authorized for &quot;such sums
as may be necessary&quot; to respond to changing economic conditions.
Entitlements have been funded by the federal government with something
of a blank check.
<P>
Spending on these &quot;mandatory&quot; programs comprise 47 percent
of the federal budget. Another 14 percent of the budget is earmarked
for interest payments -- another &quot;mandatory&quot; program.
Thus, the president and Congress have control over 39 percent
of the budget.
<P>
Social Security, which has been described as &quot;middle class
welfare&quot; is the most expensive entitlement program. Since
1965, annual expenditures have grown from $17.1 billion to $241
billion. Social Security costs have increased annually at a rate
of 8 percent since 1980. Medicare has grown even faster - at a
rate of 12 percent. And Medicaid costs have risen yearly at an
11 percent pace. With runaway spending like that, how long before
we no longer can bear the cost -- unless you believe in the myth
that we have unlimited resources.
<P>
If no changes are made in the Social Security and Medicare systems,
the government projects that Americans will be paying 30 percent
of their income in
<P>
 federal taxes just to support these two programs by the year
2030. Today, every American man, woman- and child owes $10,000
as their share of the national debt. By 2030, that share would
increase to $64,000.
<P>
Surely, something must be done - and soon. But is tinkering with
the current system the answer? I think not.
<P>
Entitlements by their very nature -- by definition - create new
rights for Americans never dreamed of by our founding fathers
and never held up for the scrutiny of a full and open public debate.
<P>
Think about it. What is the derivation of that word &quot;entitlement&quot;?
The dictionary suggests that it is a legal right to something
- it is something that has been earned.
<P>
Those in search of such services need only be a resident of the
country perhaps not even a citizen. Then the politicians, bureaucrats
or activists must discover that a need exists that has a strong
compassionate component.
<P>
Once these compassionately impelled needs are met by passing laws
and appropriating money, they become entitlements. The recipients
very rarely have done anything that should &quot;entitle&quot;
them to receive these benefits. Thus, compassionately motivated
help is converted by word manipulation to an &quot;Entitlement.&quot;
<P>
Most such entitlement programs start out modestly with the goal
of creating a &quot;safety net&quot; for the truly needy. But
they are quickly turned into &quot;rights&quot; and expanded almost
geometrically as the bureaucratic self-interest in growth takes
over.
<P>
The curious transition to the use of the word &quot;Entitlement&quot;
reflects the inherent power of words to affect emotions and frame
the terms of our national debate. To be &quot;entitled&quot; to
something, the government implies one has a right to it. In private
industry, however, these kinds of added payments are characterized
more accurately as &quot;benefits.&quot; Contrast &quot;Benefits&quot;
with &quot;entitlements&quot; and the emotional content is revealed.
Benefits are given, but entitlements are a collection of obligations.
<P>
The Declaration of Independence defined our rights as &quot;life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Happiness is not a
right, only the pursuit of it is. Our founders understood that
when government offers any more, it creates dependency rather
than freedom. Thus, we will never solve our &quot;Entitlement&quot;
problem until we understand that none of us is owed anything just
because we are here.

<h2>Judge Ideas by Results, Not Intentions</h2>
By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center>
<P>
 My friend Sidney Hook, in his transition from a Marxist to its
most vociferous and effective critic, articulated the double-standard
applied by the left when evaluating socialism and capitalism.
<P>
&quot;I was guilty of judging capitalism by its operations and
socialism by its hopes and aspirations; capitalism by its works
and socialism by its literature,&quot; he explained.
<P>
I was most fortunate to know Sidney Hook, the renowned philosopher,
well enough to have a number of discussions and arguments with
him. I rarely prevailed in any arguments. The only time I came
close was when I asked him define his, then, current politics.
He said, &quot;Suppose I would call myself a democratic socialist,&quot;
reflecting, I thought, his reluctance to go all the way to &quot;conservative.&quot;
The word oxymoron had not been invented then, so I said, &quot;But,
Sidney, that's inherently self-contradictory.&quot; His terse
reply, &quot;You may be right,&quot; was as close as I ever came
to winning a point with him.
<P>
The socialist theoreticians are so used to comparing their theory
to other theories that they cannot bring themselves to evaluate
their theories in light of reality. In its 75 years, the great
Russian empire dominated a large part of the world and its reduction
of socialist theory to practice failed miserably.
<P>
Ask the convinced socialist or the passionate advocate of central
planning why he persists in promoting a system which has been
a demonstrated failure and the likely answer will be: &quot;If
only the right people had been involved, it could have worked.&quot;
<P>
They insist that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the
system. It's just that the people in charge failed to implement
it properly. If only the right people (implied, &quot;such as
me&quot;) had been at the helm, things might have been different.
But that is the precisely the point. Men are imperfect - even
those that construct the most exquisite theories. Inevitably they
produce imperfect results.
<P>
The final test is always, in engineering terminology, reduction
to practice. Many wonderful things have resulted from well-intentioned
actions, but many harmful things have, too.  Equally, many great
things may not have been accomplished because of excessive caution.
<P>
It's tempting to describe these contracting impulses as mature
and immature, but that may be too judgmental.  We need the untrammeled
emotions to integrate ourselves from childhood to adulthood. 
But Having reached adulthood, must we lose our wonderment and
surrender to cynicism?
<P>
&quot;Maturity&quot; is the best balance btween the restrictive
obligations of the real world and the lack of restrain of our
youthful yearnings.  In phiosophic jargon, we have the classic
conflict between &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;order.&quot;
<P>
That segment of society which nourishes the childhood yearning
in us, I choose to call the art world.  Those I inlude are, of
course, the artists, the composers, the craftsmen, but also those
who write -- newspapers, books, poetry, plays.  Inlude as well
the performers, screen and television actors, the sportsmen, the
musicians, the magicians, the jugglers and the comedians -- in
short, those who successfully stimulate our emotions.
<P>
These people all appeal primarily to our childlike instincts --
those of us that are uninhibited by the restrictions of civilized
society.  They are constructive and important parts of our adult
life when filtering out the dark, destructive sides of our instinctual
youthful behavior -- the &quot;childishness,&quot; if you will.
 Along with our maturity and sense of responsibility we accept
with joy and gratitude what these wonderful people have to offer
us.  For they nourish our emotions without any boudaries of inhibition.
<P>
An important segment of the conservative world also possesses
this childlike quality to some degree.  Inventors, scientific
leaders and entrepreneurs all have a childlike longing for daring
innovation.  But scientists are, at the same time, conservative
in their willingness to test their intuitive leaps in the laboratory.
<P>
Of necessity, those who appeal to our hearts so effectively, must
themselves have a connection or a sensitivity to the child in
all of us.  How else can they be effective?  How can they know
what our hearts yearn for?  Yet even they must be bound by the
dimensions of the real world.
<P>
Most thoughtful people reject the mechanistic concept of &quot;maturity&quot;
and recognize that the full life demands both it and the childlike
impulses of which dreams are made.  Liberal thought is less inhibited.
 Conservative thought is more constrained.  But neither liberals
nor conservatives have a monopoly on wishing things were better.

<title>Letters to Congress from Jack Kemp on the B-2</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
July 31, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Member of Congress :
<p>
The House of Representatives will soon vote on the FY96 Defense Appropriations Bill.  The vote to continue production of the B-2 bomber is one of several significant national security decisions the House will make this year.  The B-2 bomber is an essential system for current and future defenses for our nation.
<p>
When the B-2 becomes operational in the very near future, the United States will have the unprecedented capability to deliver precision-guided munitions to any point on the globe from the continental United States with the confidence that the aircrew will return safely.  For example, had the B-2 been available in 1987, only one or two B-2s would have conducted the raid on Libya.  Moreover, the need to obtain permission from allies to overfly their territory and the costly and vast network of support and crews that placed hundreds of Americans at risk would have been unnecessary.  Because of the widespread recognition that the B-2 can stop aggressors in their tracks, conventional deterrence will be greatly enhanced.  And as the Heritage Foundation has suggested, in the future, the B-2 will also allow us to effectively attack mobile missile systems, thereby increasing U.S. offensive abilities.
<p>
Thus far, the post-Cold War era has been characterized with promise, opportunity, challenges and dangers.  The United States must have the capability for forceful and independent action and our advanced weapons systems are an essential element of that capacity.  The B-2 represents a significant breakthrough technology that will give us a singular and unparalleled military ability to act.  Systems such as the B-2 are vital to our role in a changing world.  The United States must be strong in order to lead; no one can do it but us.  I urge you to support continued production of the B-2 bomber program
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
<br>
Jack Kemp

<h3>Clinton's Budding Trade War or Pacific Rim Free Trade?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
"The consumer is king."  This concept underlies the free enterprise system. While entrepreneurs drive the economy with their new ideas, innovations, products and services, they ultimately must submit their wares to the tests of the marketplace.  The entrepreneur must meet current consumer demands, create new demands, or fail trying.   	<p>
Of course, the consumer reaps enormous benefits.  Competition among producers lowers prices, expands choices, and enhances quality.  International suppliers of goods and services are a major factor in this process, providing greater competition.  This fact probably never has been so clearly illustrated than in the automobile industry.  In essence, the U.S. automobile industry was saved by foreign competition.  As cost and quality suffered in the 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers could look elsewhere for their transportation needs -- foreign automobile companies.  Naturally, U.S. consumers would have reaped even greater rewards had the government not imposed various trade barriers.  However, even somewhat limited competition forced American automobile producers to improve their products -- to meet the needs of the consumer.	Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Cantor seem ready to overthrow the  consumer as king, replacing him with managed-trade bureaucrats.  The looming threat of 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports makes no economic sense.	<p>

Most absurd, the Clinton Administration wants the Japanese government to essentially guarantee market share for U.S. auto parts firms.  Imagine the fury in this nation, if the Japanese pressured the U.S. government to force private businesses to buy a certain amount of Japanese products.  To complete this strange scenario, the proposed 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury cars would be retroactive to May 20.  Retroactive taxes seem to be a favorite of this Administration -- the 1993 income tax hike was retroactive as well.<p>

A Tax Increase With All the Accompanying Evils.  One needs to remember that a tariff is a tax.  Consumers of Japanese luxury automobiles will face a 100 percent tax on their purchases, if President Clinton carries through with his tariff threat.  The end result of such an act would be to eliminate such vehicles from the U.S. marketplace -- limiting competition and consumer choices.	<p>

The Administration once again is playing the class warfare card, as it did with its 1993 tax increase.  After all, some people say so what if some wealthy individuals will have to either pay a exorbitant tax or consider purchasing a non-Japanese luxury car.  Of course, we all have heard such faulty reasoning before -- such as with the 1990 federal budget deal, which included a luxury tax on yachts.  Of course, the rich were not soaked, but the businesses and the employees who built the boats were devastated.  If the Clinton tax increase on Japanese luxury cars goes into effect on June 28, the hardest impact will be felt by U.S. importers, car dealers, and their employees.	<p>

Indeed, tens of thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.  As 
reported by The Washington Times, 8,000 Americans work in Lexus dealerships and 10,000 in Acura dealerships.  In addition to Lexus and Acura models, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Infiniti models would fall prey to Clinton's tariffs.  If implemented, these tariffs would be a clear instance where higher taxes closed businesses and placed individuals on the unemployment lines.  The Japanese import car industry asserts that as many as 81,000 jobs would be placed at risk.	An even wider threat looms for the U.S. economy, i.e., Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.  Japan is the United States' second largest trading partner.  As we all supposedly learned from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, protectionism hurts everyone in the end.<p>

<b>A Matter of Opening or Serving the Japanese Market?</b><P>
  While most Americans assume that the Japanese market is shut as tight as a clam -- especially in the area of automobiles -- this issue actually remains open to question.  For example, the U.S. may have a point regarding restrictions pertaining to access to Japanese car dealerships.  However, U.S. automakers have never been aggressive in establishing their own dealer networks in Japan.<P>

	More important is the question of supplying autos the Japanese want to drive.  As noted earlier, in order to succeed, a business must meet current or create new consumer demands.  U.S. critics of Japanese trade policies often resort to market share arguments.  That is, since U.S. automakers have captured such small market share in Japan (about 1.6 percent of the new-car market and 1.4 percent of the auto-parts market, according to Investor's Business Daily, June 16, 1995), severe trade barriers must exist.  However, other forces are clearly at work.

<P>For example, the Japanese drive on the left side of the road, 
as a result Japanese consumers are partial (obviously) to right-hand-drive vehicles.  The Economist reported in its June 17, 1995 issue that only two American car models -- in a total of three versions -- come with right-hand drive in Japan.  Meanwhile, the number of models of left-hand-drive Japanese cars in America equals 68, available in a total of 179 different versions.  One easily could conclude that U.S. automakers need to work much harder to meet the demands of Japanese consumers.<p>

<b>"Drop Your Gun, or I'll Shoot!"</b><P>

  Even if we assume that trade barriers remain the largest obstacle to U.S. autos and auto parts in Japan, why punish U.S. consumers?  Whenever a politician threatens to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports, I am reminded of those movie scenes where a character grabs an innocent bystander during a gunfight, puts a gun to that person's head, and yells to his opponent, "Drop your gun, or I'll shoot!"	 <p>

During trade wars, the innocent bystanders with economic guns pointed at their heads are consumers.  Just because the Japanese government may be treating their consumers rather shabbily is no excuse for the U.S. government to treat its consumers the same way.  The U.S. already imposes myriad tariffs and quotas that cost consumers billions of dollars annually.  Indeed, the U.S. is not exactly friendly to many Japanese auto imports, imposing quotas and a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks.  Rather than increasing such penalties, the U.S. should be lowering barriers to trade.<P>

<b>Free Trade on the Pacific Rim</b><P>
  Trade seemed to be the one area of the economy where President Clinton showed some leadership and economic understanding.  Though not perfect, NAFTA and GATT were major steps in the right direction.  Rather than issuing threats, raising trade barriers, circumventing the World Trade Organization (which Clinton helped establish to settle trade disputes), and perhaps creeping toward a full-scale trade war, President Clinton should reassert his leadership on the world scene as an advocate of free trade, and push for a Pacific Rim free trade agreement.  	<P>

The President certainly has struggled on the foreign policy front, including such hotbeds as Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya.  Not to mention that after pushing for NAFTA, his administration helped to devastate Mexico's economy by assisting the Mexican government with its wrongheaded peso devaluation and bungled policies thereafter.  The President may believe that there are political points to be scored by taking on Japan.  <P>

However, any benefits will be shortlived since his actions are so transparent.  Indeed, The New York Times observed on its editorial page (May 18, 1995) in reference to the President's threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars: "It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan."  <P>

Reasserting U.S. commitment to free trade -- by example rather than by threats -- would bolster the U.S. internationally.<P>

	A free trade initiative for the Pacific Rim would change the course of American-Japanese trade negotiations -- moving away from the threat of a trade war and toward a freer, growing international marketplace.  The President has mentioned support for such an initiative in the past, but now seems to be going off in a far different, economically dangerous direction.  For the sake of the economy, he needs to get back on the free-trade track, and a Pacific Rim initiative makes particular sense at this time.  	<P>

Unfortunately, if Clinton fails to move in this direction, there are 
few signals emanating from Republicans in Congress to indicate that they understand the issue much better.  Indeed, Republicans have been eerily silent in regards to the President's threats against Japan and, effectively, against U.S. consumers.  Indeed, some Republicans have voiced support.<P>

<b>Free Trade: Providing Opportunities for America's Entrepreneurs</b>
<P>
  A recent article in Investor's Business Daily noted that the Japanese were coming to the United States to study entrepreneurship.  A Pacific Rim free trade agreement would grant them first-hand experience.  Tearing down trade barriers around the Pacific would create enormous opportunities for American business and entrepreneurs; consumers would reap great rewards; and economic growth would receive a hearty boost.<P>

	U.S. consumers, as well as businesses and employees working in the U.S. import industry, should not be sacrificed to misguided, politically driven trade policies.  Free trade works best, and the U.S. should reclaim global leadership on this issue.

<h2>Capital Gains and Entrepreneurship</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist - Small Business Survival Foundation<br>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs are the driving force behind economic growth.  Therefore,
one of the most damaging levies government can impose on individuals
and the economy is the capital gains tax &#173;&#173; a direct
tax on risk taking.  After being reduced in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the capital gains tax rate was increased by 40 percent
&#173;&#173; from 20 percent to 28 percent &#173;&#173; under
the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  
<P>
The accompanying chart shows one measure of entrepreneurial activity
 &#173;&#173; new business incorporations from 1967 to 1995. 
Since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, new business incorporations
have been quite lackluster.  The break between a powerful rise
in new business incorporations prior to 1987 and thereafter is
striking.
<P>
Lagging entrepreneurship means a lagging economy.  Along with
the Bush and Clinton tax hikes and mounting regulatory costs,
high capital gains taxes explain much of our recent sluggish economic
growth.  Annual real economic growth has averaged just 2.3 percent
since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, particularly slowing after
1989 as the relative dearth in entrepreneurship took hold.  The
Clinton Administration estimates that this anemic 2.3 percent
annual real growth rate will continue into the foreseeable future,
grossly under&#173;performing the post&#173;Civil War annual real
average rate of 3.5 percent.  
<P>
If the capital gains tax had not been increased, incentives for
investing and risk taking would not have diminished, more capital
would have been available for investment, and chances improved
for entrepreneurial activity to increase at a healthy clip.  In
fact, if new business incorporations had managed to continue at
the average annual rate of increase from the previous two decades,
we would have seen almost 2.5 million more new business incorporations
over the period 1987 to 1995.  From 1968 to 1986, new business
incorporations rose at a 6.8 percent annual rate versus a meager
1.1 percent from 1987 to 1995.  In 1995 alone, new business incorporations
would have been almost 470,000 higher than they actually were.
 These higher levels of entrepreneurship would have meant more
products, innovations, efficiencies, economic growth, and jobs.
<P>
A deep cut in the capital gains tax and indexing for inflation
would surely boost incentives for risk taking and spur economic
growth.<BR>

<h2>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:<br>
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h2><p>
by Raymond J. Keating<p>
</center>
<hr>

<i>"[W]e have to cut the rate on capital gains, which is ... a vacuum sucking up our capital savings into the general treasury."<p></i>

-- U.S. Rep. Bill Archer.<p>
<p>

<i>"Better yet, eliminate capital-gains taxes entirely."</i><p>

-- Ed Rubenstein, Economics Analyst, National Review<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Investors are naturally reluctant to support new ventures in decaying urban neighborhoods where theft, drug abuse, violent crime and buisness bankruptcy rates are all very high.  This source of venture capital will not be tapped until sufficient incentives make inner-city investment more attractive to individual backers.  Conversely, reducing the tax on capital gains effectively increases the flow of fiancial 'seed corn' to budding entrepreneurs."<p>
</i>
-- Wall Street Journal op-ed, 8/25/93, by the chairman and four members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.<p>
<p>
<hr>
Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major obstacle -- raising capital.  The answer to this problem is not a proliferation of governmental entities siphoning taxpayer funds to fledgling businesses.  Instead, encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs to be enhanced.<p>

Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy.  There is no more important economic task than investing both	sweat and capital in new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet, the risky nature of such ventures often scares off bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

In the economic world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the <i>opportunity</i> for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in such high-risk ventures.  Capital gains taxes significantly cut into those returns, thereby diminishing incentives to invest.<p>

The Republican majorities in both houses of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the federal capital gains tax rate, and indexing the rate for inflation.  These are crucial steps to igniting entrepreneurship and investment in the U.S. economy, and thereby stimulating economic growth and job creation.  Though, <i>in order to make the United States a capital haven and an economic-growth juggernaut, taxes on capital gains should be eliminated altogether.</i><p>

<h3>Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation on capital gains income is 28 percent.<a href="#foot1">1</a>   However, when inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises substantially.<p>

For example, an individual that made a $10,000 venture capital investment in 1987, and sold it for $15,000 in 1993, would owe $1,400 in federal capital gains taxes at the 28 percent rate.  However, when factoring inflation (we use the gross domestic product deflator) into this equation, the real capital gains tax rate on this transaction jumps to 53 percent.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on <i>real capital losses</i>.  That is, after factoring inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gain.<p>

Depending on the Federal Reserve's success in maintaining stable prices, the real capital gains tax rate can fluctuate considerably as well.  Figure 1 offers an example of how the Fed's efforts, or lack thereof, to fight inflation can impact capital gains tax rates.  Listed are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  It is assumed that the investment is closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate relates to an investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.<p>

<hr>	These real rates of capital gaasdfbacsadfasdfsfdwerwerqwerq4ins taxation 	represent severe impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.  A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment, while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains determination -- equalizing stated and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

<h3>From Cutting to Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax</h3>

	Members of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50-percent exclusion on capital gains income.   Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.<p>

	However, given the critical and high-risk nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and  the importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should be excluded from taxation altogether.  A zero percent capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.<p>

	Figure 2 offers a comparison of capital gains tax rates among various nations.  The current U.S. non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not competitive internationally.  Even the two nations -- Australia and the United Kingdom -- with higher nominal rates than the United States allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.<p>

<hr>

	From a capital gains perspective, these other nations offer a more conducive and dynamic environment for investment and entrepreneurship.  In a competitive, global economy, a zero percent capital gains tax rate would make the United States a magnet for capital.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would be the most pro-growth, proactive jobs program taken by the new Congress.<p>

<h3>The Growth Effects</h3>

	The potential benefits of eliminating the capital gains tax are clear.  Figure 3, for example, notes that venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would  augment incentives to invest in new and expanding ventures.<p>

	In a report released earlier this year,<a href="#foot3">3</a> and reported on in the Small Business Survival Committee's July 1994 <i>Small Business and the Economy</i> newsletter, economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated the economic impact of eliminating the federal capital gains tax.  By the year 2000, the Robbins' projected that a zero percent capital gains tax rate would lead to: <p>

<ul>
<li>an additional $3.2 trillion in capital formation;
<li>the creation of 1.1 million additional jobs;
<li>an extra $1.6 trillion in GDP between 1994 and 2000, with annual GDP $391 billion higher than otherwise by the year 2000;
<li>an additional 0.43 percentage points on the long-term annual growth rate for the economy.
</ul><p>

<hr>
</center>
<h3>Government Revenues</h3>

	Gary and Aldona Robbins also noted that much of the lost revenue to the federal government would be recaptured due to enhanced economic growth resulting from the elimination of the capital gains tax.  In fact, when accounting for higher state and local revenues due to a higher rate of growth, they estimate that all levels of government would <i>net</i> $25 billion annually by the year 2000.<p>

	The Robbins' "dynamic" assumptions regarding the recapturing of revenues due to enhanced economic growth are much more realistic than the "static" models normally employed by critics of capital gains tax reduction.  After all, the economy is dynamic -- in the sense that individuals respond to incentives.  People are not static economic variables.<p>

	However, even if one is forced to employ unrealistic, static assumptions regarding revenue projections, the case for eliminating the capital gains tax still stands.  The purpose for eliminating capital gains taxes is to spur investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth and opportunity.  If that means cutting government spending more deeply than might be called for under a more realistic, dynamic assessment of revenues, so be it.<p>

<h3>Who Benefits?</h3>

	Opponents will employ class warfare tactics, and argue that a capital gains tax is merely a sop to the wealthy.  However, capital gains taxes are not levies on the wealthy, but levies on wealth creation.  As argued here, the benefits of eliminating capital gains levies will be felt throughout the economy as economic growth accelerates.  Simply speaking, you can't have job creation without capital investment and entrepreneurs.<p>

	In addition, capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe.  As noted in Figure 4, based on 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  As Figure 5 shows, total incomes of less than $100,000, including capital gains, claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<a href="#foot4">4</a><p>

<h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

	In addition to their false assumptions about large revenue losses and the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

	In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for high rewards.<p>

<h3>Small Business and the Economy Will Benefit From a 0% Capital Gains Tax Rate</h3>

	Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature death.  And with such deaths also go products, services, and jobs.  By eliminating the capital gains tax, Congress and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and opportunity.<p>

	History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact, during the 1980s, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created, and the employment ratio<a href="#head5">5</a> reached a record-high 63 percent in 1989.<p>

	The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form reduced venture capital investment and restrained entrepreneurship.<p>

	The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>

For Immediate Release<br>
July 31, 1995<br>
<p>
<center>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<h2>Capital Gains Taxation and Venture Capital</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<p>Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
   Venture capital epitomizes the great spirit of entrepreneurial
capitalism.  Visionary individuals place their resources at great
risk by investing in new ideas, inventions, and innovations &#173;&#173;
by investing in entrepreneurs.  In their own right, venture capitalists
are entrepreneurs themselves.  By making capital available to
promising enterprises, they help to create dynamic change and
growth in the economy.
<P>
   In addition to the many market&#173;based obstacles and risks
confronted by such investors, the government piles on its own
costs.  At the top of the government's destructive actions rests
the capital gains tax.  Capital gains taxation impedes risk taking
by venture capitalists by cutting into potential returns.  The
vast risks associated with venture capital investments need to
be offset by opportunities for substantial returns.  Today's lofty,
non&#173;indexed capital gains tax clearly restrains venture capital
investing, and therefore, entrepreneurship and economic growth.
 
<P>
   As noted in the accompanying chart, real capital commitments
to private venture capital funds were rising robustly prior to
a sharp increase in the capital gains tax in 1987.  The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 possessed one key flaw &#173;&#173; the capital gains
tax was increased by 40 percent, from 20 percent to 28 percent.
 In addition, since capital gains are not indexed for inflation,
the real capital gains tax rate turns out to be much higher than
this oft&#173;stated nominal rate of 28 percent. 
<P>
   Prior to the 1987 capital gains tax hike, real venture capital
commitments rose at a 29.4 percent average annual rate from 1981
to 1986.  Afterwards, the real annual rate of increase averaged
6.5 percent.  A lower capital gains tax rate would have meant
greater venture capital investment.  Indeed, if the average real
rate of increase in venture funds during the early 1980s had been
maintained, 1995 commitments might have topped $40 billion &#173;&#173;
ten times the actual 1995 level.
<P>
   Any serious effort to shift economic growth into high gear
means boosting private sector incentives for investing and risk
taking in order to get capital in the hands of entrepreneurs.
 That, in turn, means eliminating the capital gains tax.<BR>

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

<h3>Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
Since the Republicans seized control of Congress in the November 1994 elections, stock prices have been positively buoyant.  Indeed, between November 4, 1994 -- the Friday before election day -- to September 20, 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 3807.52 to 4792.69 -- up over 25 percent.  The broader S&P 500 Index climbed from 462.28 to 586.77 -- up almost 27 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite  jumped from 766.08 to 1065.09 -- up almost 39 percent.	
<p>
One may be tempted to call this a Republican bull market.  In fact, that may be the case.  However, it is not party affiliation that matters, but the policies being pursued by those in elected (e.g., Congress and the President) and appointed (e.g., the Federal Reserve) offices.  The Republicans rode into Congress last November promising deregulation, smaller government, elimination of the budget deficit, and tax cuts.  While this combined package has no doubt influenced stock prices, maximum impact springs from the proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent and index capital gains for inflation.  It's basic Adam Smith economics -- higher potential profits attract investors.	
<p>
<b>Can't Afford Any Backsliding on Capital Gains.</b>  
<p>
Some faltering in the new Congress' "revolutionary" agenda can be detected.  Instead of eliminating four cabinet level departments as originally envisioned, a massive struggle is underway to eliminate just the Commerce Department.  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and PBS lingers.  Indeed, overall federal government spending will continue to rise.  Much-needed reform of how the federal government regulates the private sector is stalled.  Repeal of the blatantly racist and costly Davis-Bacon Act is in serious doubt.  Such shortcomings will take a toll on the economy as well as on Republican political capital.  However, an inability to cut and index the capital gains tax would be the most damaging blow to entrepreneurship, investment and the economy.	
<p>
As the old saying goes, if you want less of something, tax it.  Investors have been counting on a lower, indexed capital gains tax since late last year.  This anticipation explains a good portion of the rise in stock prices during this period.  Failure to deliver on such a pro-entrepreneur tax cut would amount to a sharp blow to capital markets.  In particular, start-up and high-growth, high-tech enterprises would feel the most pain.  In the event of a failure to cut and index the capital gains tax, potential returns on such high-risk endeavors would be reduced and, therefore, so would equity prices.  The amount of capital available for investment would be far less under a higher, non-indexed capital gains tax rate -- indeed, by various estimates, trillions of dollars less.	
<p>
<b>Main Street vs. Wall Street?</b>  
<p>
Of course, opponents paint capital gains tax reduction as a rich-vs.-poor issue, or even as "Wall Street" vs. "Main Street."  Such a confrontation is mythical.  When the successful Main Street entrepreneur with a good idea needs capital to expand and create more jobs, he seeks out investors.  To do so, he often goes to Wall Street.  A lower, indexed capital gains tax -- that is, a higher potential return on capital -- makes it far easier to attract investors.	
<p>
What hurts Wall Street, hurts Main Street, and vice versa.  And of course, what helps one also helps the other.  The best way for federal officials to help would be the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.  Short of such a sound economic policy initiative, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent and indexing for inflation will do quite nicely for now.	
<p>
<b>Again, the Importance of Retroactive Indexing.</b>  
<p>
As for indexing, its importance cannot be stressed enough.  This has been noted in previous SBSC publications.  The Senate is wavering on indexation.  The House has called only for prospective indexing (calculated from January 1, 1995) on assets held for at least three years.  To make sure that the real capital gains tax rate does not rise above 19.8 percent, that trillions of dollars are unlocked for new investment, and that resources find their way to their best uses, retroactive indexing must be passed and the three-year time limit for indexation eliminated.  	
<p>
The most pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur step this Congress could possibly muster this year is real, significant capital gains tax relief.  It also happens to be a good avenue for keeping a bull market chugging along.

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

<h3>Who Will Be Tax Reform's "Braveheart"?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
The need to overhaul our tax code has long been apparent, but the necessary political courage was always in short supply.  However, a historic transformation may be under way in Congress as tax overhaul now receives serious consideration.  	As portrayed in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart," William Wallace laid the groundwork for Robert the Bruce to gain Scotland's independence from England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  One might say that House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer are vying for the role of William Wallace on the matter of tax reform, hoping that their own Robert the Bruce will be elected president in 1996 leading to independence from the many burdens of our current income tax structure.
<p><b>	Can an Income Tax Be Benign?</b>
<P>  As constituted today, the federal income tax system is a mess.  It is punitive, complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.  Interestingly however, when initially imposed, the federal income tax appeared rather straightforward and not all that burdensome -- almost benign.  Of course, appearances can be deceiving.
<p>
<b>Original Personal Income Tax</b>  
<P>
As originally proposed, the income tax was meant to impose a very low level of tax rates on only the very highest levels of income.  The 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax eventually won approval because proponents argued that it was a way to force the so-called "robber barons" to pay taxes.  The income tax was not supposed to be a mechanism for reaching into the pockets of most Americans.
<p>
	Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this point quite clearly.  <a href="#1">Figure 1</a> shows the personal income tax structure as initially imposed in 1913, while <a href="#2">Figure 2</a> illustrates what this tax system would look like in 1994 dollars.
<p>
	Undoubtedly, the income tax was not meant to be paid by most citizens, nor were rates so high as to significantly undermine the spirit of enterprise.  For example, if the original income tax system had been left in effect and indexed for inflation, today single taxpayers would pay no tax on any earnings up to almost $45,000 and married couples on earnings up to almost $60,000.  A 1 percent tax rate would be in effect on incomes up to about $300,000.  The top rate of 7 percent would not take hold until earnings of almost $7.5 million.
<p>
<b>Original Corporate Income Tax</b>
<P>
  As for the corporate income 
tax, it was imposed in 1909 at a rate of 1 percent and a $5,000 exemption.  Again, translated into 1994 dollars, corporate income would face the 1 percent rate with an exemption of $81,967.
<p>
<b>Envy = Bad Economics</b>
<P>
  The income tax was an attempt to finance the expansion of government through an appeal to envy.  Envy, though, tends to know no boundaries, and never makes for good economic policy.  The income tax was transformed rather quickly from a light tax on very high incomes to a heavy tax on almost all levels of income.  Naturally, tax avoidance among upper-income individuals -- the ultimate targets of the income tax -- increased along with rising tax rates.
<p>
	As the U.S. undertakes a historic debate over its tax system in the coming months and years, it must be remembered at all times that the income tax remains a dangerous levy.  It raises the costs of working, saving, investing, and risk taking, thereby restraining economic growth.  
<p>
<b>A Boost to Government Spending</b>
<P>
  The income tax also acts as high-octane fuel for the growth of government spending.  Under the income-tax regime, between 1913 and 1994, inflation-adjusted federal government expenditures increased by 13,592 percent!  Over this same period, personal and corporate income taxes grew from 7 percent of total federal revenues and 0.1 percent of the economy, to more than 54 percent of total federal revenues and over 10 percent of U.S. GDP.	
<P>
<b>No Income Tax Led to High Growth</b>
<P>
  As the nineteenth century came to a close and the twentieth century dawned, the United States government imposed no income taxes on its citizens.  It was a period when America took great strides in becoming the world's most powerful economy.  Entrepreneurs pushed the economy to astounding rates of economic growth.  In fact, from 1870 to 1913 -- from when it was agreed that the Civil War income tax would end until the income tax was re-imposed -- the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms, or by an average rate of more than 10 percent per year -- with no inflation.	
<P>
<b>Reforms for the 21st Century</b>
<P>
  As the twentieth century comes to a close and we look toward the twenty-first century, many are concerned with America's economic vitality in an increasingly competitive world economy.  Surely, we must considerably downsize government, deregulate our economy, and re-link the dollar to gold to ensure greater price stability.
<p>
	Perhaps most important, though, we should replace our current tax system with a low, flat tax -- bringing us closer to the original intent of the income tax.  To some degree, this is Representative Armey's suggestion -- his bid, if you will, to be the William Wallace of tax reform.  In contrast, some say simply put an end to one of the twentieth century's biggest impediments to entrepreneurship and growth - the income tax -- and replace it with a direct consumption tax, such as a national retail sales tax.  This is Representative Archer's claim to being a Wallace-like tax reformer.	As long as rates are kept low, the resulting entrepreneurial boom from either plan will stagger even the most wild-eyed optimists and launch the U.S. economy into the twenty-first century.  Of course, as to who will play the role of Robert the Bruce, and actually implement a massive tax revolution, remains to be determined in November 1996.
<p>
<b>Guarding Against Losing Tax Independence</b>
<P>
  One needs to remember, though, that after William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Scotland eventually lost its independence.  Tax reformers face a similar, ominous threat to their long-run success.  Specifically, flat tax proponents must guard against future presidents and members of Congress merely raising tax rates after most all deductions have been eliminated.  The only way to guard against such backsliding is to require a super-majority vote of the Congress in order to raise taxes.  
<p>
	Retail-sales-tax advocates, of course, must ensure that an 
income tax is not re-imposed at some point down the road.  They must repeal the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax.	
<p>
Today, the flat tax holds the upper hand politically, and is well worth fighting to implement.  A flat tax rate of 17 percent (preferably even lower), with no taxation of capital gains, interest earned, and dividends, would boost significantly crucial incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks.  	
<p>
In the long run, however, given the destructive nature and history of the income tax, economic freedom and independence for entrepreneurs and all citizens may only be guaranteed by eliminating the income tax, to be "replaced" by government spending cuts and a low retail sales levy of less than 10 percent.  Such a "dream" tax code, though, is not yet in the cards.  Today's revolution is not quite that revolutionary.

<center><i>November 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Improving the Flat Tax</h3> <P>
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><P>	
<hr>
<P>
It is encouraging to see that significant proposals for overhauling the U.S. tax system are actually under serious consideration today, not only in the many think tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape, but in the halls of Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.  In a couple of years, our federal tax code may shed thousands of pages and actually make sense to all Americans.  Indeed, the income tax as we now know it may no longer exist.	Tax Principles.  In a recent Small Business Survival Foundation booklet, "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans," our current tax system and a variety of proposed substitutes were analyzed and scored.  Each system was evaluated according to a set of principles for sound taxation: <P>
<ul>
<LI> maintain a low, flat tax rate to limit economic distortions and promote growth; <LI> cease taxing returns on capital, particularly capital gains, in order to eliminate double taxation and spur entrepreneurship and investment -- the economy's lifeblood; 
<LI> create no tax-based 
incentives for government to inflate the currency; 
<LI> clarity -- taxes and who pays them should be obvious; <LI> paying taxes should be as simple as possible for the taxpayer; 
<LI> the tax-gathering bureaucracy should be limited in both size and powers; 
<LI> incentives for tax avoidance should be minimized; 
<LI> and finally, a tax system 
should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.	
</ul><P>
<b>Flat Tax and Retail Sales Tax Score Best</b><P>
  According to these criteria, the flat tax and national retail sales tax score best, followed at quite a distance by the value-added tax, the consumed-income tax, and our current mess of a tax code.  Of the top two proposals, the flat tax carries the most significant political support at this time.<P>
<b>Armey Plan</b><P>
  As currently proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey, a flat tax would impose a 17 percent rate on both personal and business income.  For individuals, capital gains, dividends, and interest income would not be taxed, having already been captured at the business level.  Personal allowances could be deducted at $21,400 for a couple, and $5,000 for each dependent.  Therefore, a family of four would not pay any tax on earnings up to $31,400.	For business, the 17 percent tax rate would apply to gross revenues minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest paid, or payments to owners.	Such a plan would simplify greatly how individuals and businesses pay taxes.  <P>Reducing the top tax rate to 17 percent boosts incentives for work and risk taking.  An absence of taxation on individual capital gains, dividend, and interest income, and expensing of capital goods by business, will spur entrepreneurship and investment. <P>
 	A great threat to the beauty and efficiency of the flat tax remains politicians' incessant desire to serve special interests by tinkering with the tax code -- creating loopholes and raising rates.   The current Armey plan would counter such tendencies by requiring a three-fifths super-majority congressional vote in order to raise taxes.  <P>
<b>	Three Steps to a Better Flat Tax</b><P>
  As good as this plan is, however, room for improvement on the flat tax exists.  Three steps would place the flat tax on firmer economic ground -- in greater compliance with the aforementioned principles of sound taxation -- though albeit on more radical political terrain.  However, aren't Republicans telling us we are in the midst of a political revolution?  	<P>
First, the original Armey flat tax plan called for the end of individual income tax withholding, which had begun as a wartime measure during World War II.  <P>

Ending withholding would drive home the true cost of government to the taxpayer.  Instead of having taxes withdrawn before receiving one's paycheck, taxpayers would receive their full pay and then have to write out a check to the federal government for income taxes  on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Individuals would gain a much clearer picture of how much government costs.  In its most recent manifestation, though, the Armey plan no longer proposes an end to withholding.  This much-needed reform should be reinstated.	<P>

Second, tax reformers should stop worshiping the idol of "revenue neutrality."  A desire for revenue-neutral tax reform already forced Rep. Armey to reduce his proposed personal allowances and deductions.  Taxpayers and the U.S. economy need both a sound tax system and lower taxes.  Setting a goal of revenue neutrality means that one tacitly accepts that current levels of government spending and taxation are just right, a dubious proposition to say the least.<P>

In 1995, the federal government will spend $1.54 trillion.  Rather than accepting as inevitable a relentless climb to $2 trillion -- as both Democrats and Republicans seemingly have done -- the goal should be to reduce spending -- descending to the $1 trillion mark.  <P>

Room for downsizing government is substantial and the need for tax reduction paramount.  	<P>
Third, it remains in dispute as to who bears the ultimate burden when it comes to paying business income taxes -- owners, employees, consumers, or some combination of these individuals?  No matter how the burden shakes out, business income taxes remain hidden from the view of those who pay them.  Clarity dictates that taxing income at the business level should be terminated, with dividends taxed, if at all, at the individual level.	Smaller Government and a Flat Tax.  Tax overhaul needs to be part of a comprehensive effort to ease governmental burdens.  Government spending has to be cut substantially.  Income at the business level, capital gains, and interest earned should not be taxed at all.  And the tax rate on all remaining income -- wages, salaries, and dividends -- needs to be as low as possible.  Throughout history, until the early-to-mid twentieth century, a levy of 10 percent was always considered a heavy tax.  A ten percent flat tax on wages, salaries and dividends, with no deductions, would still allow the federal government to collect more than $300 billion in income taxes, conservatively estimated, not to mention revenues from the social security payroll tax.	What would result from this even more revolutionary version of the flat tax?  <P>Entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation would be driven to heights that in recent high-tax-rate decades were considered unimaginable.<P><P><center>[ <a href="/sbsc/home.html>SBSC Home</a> | <a href="/sbsc/i-tax.html">Tax Watch Index</a> ]</center></body></html>

Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections, conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress. For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope of government.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although President Clinton repeatedly has vetoed major legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and retreats, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses. While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents. Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives should appreciate the progress that has been made.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating $245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This legislation not only represented the first balanced budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in government programs which would have returned power to states and communities. In spite of the President's obstructionism, however, Congress succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the taxpayer's credit for cutting the Administration's projected deficit nearly in half.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  But it was conservatives in Congress who made this promise a reality. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill. Congress restored funding for important national security programs that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress. Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of costly new mandates, and stopped unjustified new regulations. Congress delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. In addition, the 104th Congress gave the President the line-item veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance. However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts access to health insurance.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of its success in other areas, Congress has more work to do to complete work on other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs that were unthinkable before 1994.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over."  The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS REFORMED THE WELFARE SYSTEM</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress passed historic welfare reform legislation; and after vetoing two previous versions of welfare reform, President Clinton finally signed the congressional welfare reform bill into law on August 22, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals have long opposed serious welfare reform, arguing that if the federal government continues its traditional practice of offering free handouts, children in particular will be better off, and the social maladies that characterize the life of low-income Americans in many of our urban and rural areas will decline or disappear. The liberal experiment in social policy has been tried and has failed.<sup>2</sup>  No scientific study has ever demonstrated that increasing welfare benefits to low-income persons improves the long-term prospects of the children of those persons. Indeed, children on welfare, compared to children whose families are poor but are not on welfare, do poorly: They do less well in school and earn less. The liberal welfare state has not helped children; it has hurt them.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The congressional legislation reforms the current welfare system in four major ways:
<P>
<b>1. It eliminates perverse financial incentives for state government.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the major welfare program for unmarried mothers and children established in 1935, has been funded on an entitlement basis. Traditionally, this has meant that the more persons a state enrolls in AFDC, the greater will be the funds received from the federal government. Conversely, if a governor reduces the number of persons on welfare, federal funding to his state is reduced. Clearly, AFDC's entitlement funding structure creates perverse incentives for state government, penalizing states which reduce dependency and rewarding those which allow their welfare caseloads to grow.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new congressional welfare reform legislation eliminates these perverse incentives by creating a new funding system. Under this new system, each state will be given a fixed dollar grant which will be increased gradually from year to year. If a state reduces its AFDC caseload, its federal grant will not be cut. Instead, the state will be permitted to keep any surplus federal funds that are generated by caseload reduction and apply those funds to other efforts to aid the poor. On the other hand, if a state permits its AFDC caseload to grow rapidly, the state -- not the federal government -- will bear the added cost.
<p>
<b>2. It slows the growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to claims by liberals in Congress and certain reports in the press, the congressional reform bill will not cut welfare spending. It merely slows the rate of growth in spending. Seven major programs are affected by the legislation:<p><ul>

<li>Aid to Families with Dependent Children;
<li>Food Stamps;
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
<li>School lunch and other child nutrition programs;
<li>Foster Care;
<li>Social Services Block Grant; and
<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under prior law, aggregate spending in these programs was scheduled to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 6 percent).  The congressional reform legislation will slow the rate of growth to around 35 percent over seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 4.5 percent). Thus, the reform will permit future aggregate state spending in these programs to expand faster than the rate of inflation.
<p>
<b>3. It establishes work requirements.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the new law, welfare no longer will be a one-way handout. The law establishes serious, correctly designed standards for the states and work requirements for welfare recipients; the goal is for states to reduce their caseloads, not to process greater numbers of persons through welfare. Specified percentages of AFDC recipients will be required to take private-sector jobs. If a state is unable to reduce its caseload through placements in the private sector, it will be required to place certain numbers of welfare recipients in community service work in exchange for welfare benefits. When working in a community service job, the welfare recipient must be in a "pay after performance" system: The beneficiary will not receive AFDC benefits until after the community service work has been completed satisfactorily. If the individual fails to work the prescribed number of hours, his welfare benefits will be reduced accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One weakness in the reform legislation is that because of numerous loopholes, the number of recipients who will be required to work is quite low. By 1999, the typical state will be required to have only 18 percent of its AFDC caseload working. The new law, however, is still an improvement over the current system.
<p>
<b>4. It provides incentives to reduce illegitimacy.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the present time, nearly one-third of all American children are born out of wedlock. There is a growing consensus, among liberals and conservatives alike, that the growth in illegitimacy is a social catastrophe for the nation. The collapse of marriage and the rise in out-of-wedlock births encourage welfare dependency as well as crime and many other social problems.<sup>4</sup>  The welfare reform bill contains three provisions to combat illegitimacy. First, it will focus the attention of state governments on the illegitimacy problem by requiring each state to set numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy over the next ten years. Second, it will provide bonus funding to states which reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion rates. Third, it will create a new program to provide abstinence education, funded at $50 million per year.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While it is not perfect, the congressional welfare reform legislation is a significant step in the right direction. It represents the largest change in federal welfare policy since the initiation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much more, however, has to be done. Congress must begin the job of rebuilding and revitalizing America's inner-city neighborhoods, promoting moral as well as urban renewal in the nation's most devastated communities and giving hope to millions of Americans trapped in environments whose principal distinguishing characteristics are broken families, crime-ridden communities, and economic and physical deterioration. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Their goals are real enterprise zones in urban and rural areas to encourage business opportunities and job creation in the nation's poorest communities; scholarships for poor children to attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that reinforce traditional moral virtues; a charitable contribution tax credit to any American who makes a contribution to any private charity engaged in providing direct services to the nation's poor; and the elimination of official discrimination against religious or faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers -- the very programs that most often use public funds for these purposes most effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives in Congress have a full agenda in social policy. Serious welfare reform is only the beginning.

<h3> HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS REFORMED ITSELF</h3></font></b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Imperial Congress was dethroned in 1994, and conservatives who had railed against an insulated ruling class in Washington had reason to celebrate. The switch in majorities alone deposed decades-tenured House and Senate committee chairmen who had frustrated Ronald Reagan's policy initiatives and hounded his appointees. But the new majority was far more than an ideological mirror image of the old. Beginning with its first day in January 1995, the 104th Congress instituted sweeping reforms of its own internal operations and budget, the legislative process, and congressional relations with the states and the executive branch.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abuses of the old order were rooted out, not only with new leaders, but with new laws and rules which amount to the most sweeping changes in decades. More important, these changes likely represent an enduring and positive change in the way Americans govern themselves. As a result of reforms enacted in the past two years, future Congresses will be unable to perpetrate many of the abuses practiced by politicians in the past. The new Congress strictly limited gifts and perks, agreed to abide by laws imposed on the private sector, cut its budget and staff, limited its own spending and taxing powers, and agreed to avoid new impositions on state and local governments. By acting voluntarily to curb its own powers and privileges in this way, the 104th Congress has been truly revolutionary.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the new Congress has received insufficient credit for these achievements. The reasons: They are not widely known to the public, many of the early reforms were forgotten during the political storms of last winter, and procedural reforms take time to bear fruit. Further, many Americans were disappointed that Congress failed, albeit narrowly, to approve the most popular and sweeping reform: term limits. But the blame does not lie with Congress, which advanced term limits farther and faster than nearly any previous constitutional amendment proposal. Votes in the House and Senate have laid the groundwork, making eventual passage of a constitutional amendment highly likely. The real culprit is the Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws imposing term limits on Members of Congress. Had the Court ruled the other way, a constitutional amendment would have been more swift and certain, and some Representatives would have been facing term limits as early as 1998.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repairing the public's fractured trust in Congress will take a long time, but a simple listing of reforms implemented since January 1995 should cheer Americans who sometimes despair about whether politicians can ever get things right. Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself;

<p><li>Froze congressional pay;

<p><li>Cut its own budget and staff;

<p><li>Granted line-item veto authority to future Presidents;

<p><li>Banned most gifts to Members of Congress;

<p><li>Required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities;

<p><li>Restricted laws imposing burdens on states and communities (unfunded mandates);

<p><li>Reduced franking (free mail) and other perks;

<p><li>Imposed term limits on committee chairmen and top House and Senate leaders;

<p><li>Abolished an entire agency (the Office of Technology Assessment);

<p><li>Privatized support services;

<p><li>Eliminated government grants to nonprofit lobbying groups;

<p><li>Repealed a law that favored congressional staff in hiring for career government jobs; and

<p><li>Established a mechanism for Congress to review major new regulations.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to these reforms applying to the entire Congress, the House of Representatives, which had been subject to more severe criticism for its management and procedures, acted on its own to:
<ul>
<p><li>Require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to increase taxes;

<p><li>Conduct its first comprehensive audit and modernized financial management;

<p><li>Reform the committee structure, eliminating three full committees and 25 subcommittees;

<p><li>Prohibit absentee (proxy) voting in committees;

<p><li>Open committee meetings and information to the media and the public;

<p><li>Create a new corrections day process to repeal unreasonable rules and regulations;

<p><li>Guarantee that the minority party would have more opportunities to amend legislation; and

<p><li>Compare spending proposals to existing spending (rather than to inflated projections).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The result of these reforms is a Congress that is less costly, less bureaucratic, and less insulated from the concerns of average Americans. It is more open, more responsive, and more accountable to voters. It is, in brief, a Congress more befitting a democratic republic, and unless these reforms are abandoned or reversed, Americans should discover a growing sense of confidence in their ability to govern themselves through Congress.
<p>

<b>THE FIRST DAY</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and practices. The 1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate. The Contract With America promised numerous changes in House rules, and the new leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate and ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House voted to end procedures that had become increasingly arbitrary and secretive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of the institution's critics. The rules were designed to:<ul>

<p><li>Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller reporting on spending bills;

<p><li>Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing committee staff;

<p><li>Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate transcripts, and conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances; and

<p><li>Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight specific first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing, in most cases with large bipartisan majorities:
<ol>
<p><li><b>Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</b> The new rules package eliminated three House committees (Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries) and 25 subcommittees. The committee reform provision also shrank House committee staff by one-third.

<p><li><b>Truth in Budgeting.</b> Appropriations committees are now required to compare new spending recommendations to the current spending level. Under the old system, tax-and-spend liberals had the upper hand because spending increases were judged not against what actually was spent last year, but against projected spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending increase could be called a "cut."

<p><li><b>Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</b> House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure of committee chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses had been that committee chairmen, who set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most powerful committees (Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce) had held these positions for over a decade; the chairman of the third (Appropriations) had just vacated his position after holding it since the 1970s.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more than four Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional officer of the legislative branch in line with the President, his executive branch counterpart.

<p><li><b>Elimination of Proxy Voting.</b> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to lend their votes to other members was critical to ensuring fairness and improving committee deliberation. Although House rules strictly prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on the House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by violations of this rule), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proxy voting promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits. Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and force Members to show up and actually participate in the work of their committees if they want their votes to count.
<p>
<p><li><b>Open Meetings.</b> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public access to committee meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason. In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret (Appropriations and Ways and Means) were the ones making controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (previously, media coverage was subject to a vote of approval). The new rules also require that committees publish recorded committee votes in their reports (most voting records previously were available only at committee offices) and that hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.

<p><li><b>Tax Hikes More Difficult.</b> The new rules require a three-fifths vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been particularly controversial, with some Washington commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the conviction that new tax increases are needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions voters have imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the most beneficial aspects of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes would have to alter or waive the rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
<p>
<li><b>House Audit.</b> Another 1995 rules change authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting firm. Some House accounts previously had been audited sporadically by the General Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts were not examined regularly, and some may never have been reviewed by an independent examiner. This audit -- the first complete accounting of the House's financial status ever made available to the public -- uncovered 14 material weaknesses (significant deficiencies) in House accounting and financial control processes and resulted in a complete overhaul of House financial management practices.

<p><li><b>Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</b> The last of the Contract reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic importance. It underscores the principle that no American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its application. The bill also should encourage legislators to review the burdens that federal laws place on American citizens and ensure that the benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</ol>

<p>
<b>EARLY SUCCESSES</b>
<p>

<b>Congressional Accountability Act.</b> After being passed by the House on its first day in session, the Congressional Accountability Act was taken up by the Senate as its first item of business. The Senate added an eleventh law, the Veterans Reemployment and Training Act, to the ten the House had applied to Congress; it also strengthened congressional employees' judicial review and appeal rights. The House quickly approved the Senate changes and sent the bill to President Clinton, who signed it on January 23.
<p>
<b>Unfunded Mandates.</b> The second piece of legislation considered by the Senate bars unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments. This was also an item in the Contract With America, though not on the list of "first-day" reforms. As with the Congressional Accountability Act, the House and Senate speedily passed this legislation, which President Clinton then signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the federal government essentially had run out of money over the past decade, Congress increasingly had resorted to laws requiring state or local governments to provide new services. Aside from upsetting the balance of federal powers, this allowed one agency of government (Congress) to expand services while leaving others to raise taxes to pay the bills. This was a sure formula both for expanding government and for increasing voter discontent. The new law requires congressional committees to assess and report the costs of any requirements imposed on states or localities. It also requires the House and Senate to vote explicitly to impose new mandates. As a result of this law, Congress has stopped even considering imposing new unfunded mandates. Rather than trigger scrutiny under the new law, congressional committees have rewritten communications, environmental, and other laws to avoid imposing new costs on state and local governments.
<p>
<b>Senate Reforms.</b> The Senate did not reform its internal procedures to the degree the House did, largely because a bipartisan tradition had allowed incremental reforms to be implemented over a number of years, making a large package unnecessary. The Senate did, however, echo the House by imposing term limits on committee chairmen and on the Majority Leader (the Senate's most influential member). The Senate also cut committee staffs by a substantial 15 percent and worked with the House to devise overall congressional budget cuts.
<p>
<b>Term Limits.</b> The new Congress also held the first-ever House vote on term limits, and provided the first serious consideration in the Senate. On March 29, 1995, as a part of the Contract With America, the House voted 227-204 in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting House and Senate service to 12 years. Though a majority favored term limits, the total was 63 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states. In a similar fashion, the Senate voted 58-42 in favor of a "cloture" motion on term limits, like the House, garnering a simple majority, but falling short of two-thirds support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While supporters of term limits were disappointed by the failure to achieve the two-thirds majorities necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states, at least members of the House and Senate are on record as publicly supporting or opposing term limits. Supporters now have a standard against which they can measure future Congresses, and voters will know -- unequivocally -- where their representatives stand on this important issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Supporters of terms limits should remember that a majority in Congress voted for them; the real culprits are not in the majority, but among those Members still opposed, as well as on the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<sup>1</sup> the Court held that states may not impose term limits on their own representatives in Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress may not act on its own to impose term limits by statute. The impact of this decision was to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and make a constitutional amendment essential to achieving term limits for Congress.<p><b>Budget Cuts.</b> The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY 1996 legislative branch appropriations bill provided systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted, including spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary offices and functions. The FY 1996 and 1997 congressional budgets reduced spending in real dollars -- not phony "baseline" cuts -- by $161 million, or 9 percent below the 1995 level. Had Congress and the President made similar cuts in every other agency and program, the federal budget would be balanced next year. While cutting every program (including interest payments and Social Security) is clearly unrealistic, it is evident that Congress took its share of cuts and more.
<p>
<b>Pay and Pensions.</b> Members of Congress made personal sacrifices as well, voting in both the 1996 and 1997 appropriations cycles to freeze their own pay. Congress also approved reforms in the bloated congressional pension system. Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as generous as those of most Fortune 500 corporations. Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure. Unfortunately, the pension reforms approved by Congress were part of the reconciliation package which was vetoed by President Clinton in November 1995.
<p>
<b>Perks.</b> Cuts in congressional perks contributed to budget savings, including a $20 million cut in franking (postage) costs achieved by cutting the budget for each Representative by one-third, bringing down the average annual allowance from $163,000 to $108,000 per office. The House achieved further savings by privatizing food services, mail handling, and other support functions.
<p>
<b>Agencies and Personnel.</b> Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the government by slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded agencies, including the $21 million Office of Technology Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the national legislature. The reforms pushed the General Accounting Office to privatize its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract out some of its auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available in the private sector. The result is a cut of more than 25 percent in the GAO's budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In line with budget savings, Congress cut total employment by over 2,600 positions, nearly 10 percent of the total for Congress and its agencies.
<p>
<b>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban.</b> In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting the types and amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The Senate passed a complex rule that allows single gifts up to $50, with a $100 annual limit. Any item less than $10 falls outside the Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping proposal, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to prohibit all gifts. Both the Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for commemorative items and expenses related to official activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the House and Senate in late 1995. While this legislation would institute new reporting requirements and close loopholes in the original 1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many potential pitfalls. It protects legitimate grassroots organizing as well as incidental or small lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Line-Item Veto.</b> Among the most potentially far-reaching reforms approved by the 104th Congress is the line-item veto, which will be available to the President who takes office in January 1997. The removal of presidential impoundment authority (the practice of refusing to spend all the money Congress appropriated) in the 1974 budget reforms was one factor in the continuing stream of high deficits from that year on. Despite partisan differences, the 104th Congress agreed that the President should be able to excise unneeded items from appropriations bills and send them back to Congress. Unless both houses can muster a two-thirds vote to override the President's objections, the spending cuts stand. This is a power used by 43 state governors and, effectively, by Presidents prior to 1974. Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked Congress for just this authority. The 104th Congress's approval of the line-item veto was an act of political magnanimity and unmatched institutional restraint.
<p>

<b>CONTINUING REFORMS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As impressive as this list of reform accomplishments is, even more impressive is the fact that leaders and members of the 104th Congress remain committed to further reforms. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has vowed that a term limits amendment will be the first item of business for the House in the next Congress. Balanced budget and tax limitation amendments also will be brought back for consideration. Several House and Senate committees are considering changes in the budget process, which probably will be altered in 1997.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is exploring ways to streamline Senate procedures, and separate Republican and Democratic task forces in the House have issued reports urging further changes in House procedures. These are likely to result in another opening-day package of House rules changes in January 1997. Among the most likely items for action is a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, which would make information about Congress more widely available on the Internet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other House rules changes which have widespread support are a truth in testimony proposal to require witnesses testifying before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal grants and contracts they receive, and a proposal to require sponsors of legislation to cite specific authority from the Constitution to justify it. Following up on the Unfunded Mandates Act, Senator Ted Stevens and others are promoting legislation to enforce the Tenth Amendment and its reservation of powers to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Too often, revolutionaries who seize power become too much like the leaders they overthrew. Some Americans may even fear that this has happened to the 104th Congress. But a review of congressional reform accomplishments over the last two years shows that the reformers stayed true to their cause. They achieved most of their goals (and even exceed some) and remain committed to further political reform in the next Congress.

<h3>
HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED THE NATION'S SECURITY</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more stark and disturbing than in defense and foreign policy. Failures in economic and domestic policy are bad enough. But negligence, complacency, incompetence, and self-delusion in national security are matters of life and death, as the terrorist bombing of the U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, so tragically attests. When the Commander in Chief is not up to the job, lives are lost and vital national interests are injured.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President, as Commander in Chief, has the primary constitutional responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign and defense policy. But the Framers of the Constitution wisely did not place all the responsibility in the President's hands: The constitutional system of checks and balances assigns much of the responsibility for national security to Congress. Under Article I, Section 8, "The Congress shall have Power to... provide for the common Defence and general welfare of the United States... ," including the power "To declare war... To Raise and support Armies... To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.... "

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress exercises oversight authority for the conduct of foreign and security policy through the authorization and appropriation of funds for executive branch agencies. The Senate also has specific national security responsibilities, both through its power to confirm Administration appointments and officers of the armed services and, most significantly, through its role in approving or disapproving the ratification of treaties, as spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 104th Congress has performed with great credit in carrying out these responsibilities, though in some cases the results have not been commensurate with the quality or intensity of the effort. Indeed, there are limits to what Congress can do to protect the nation's security if the Commander in Chief persists in following misguided policies, or is guilty of slipshod execution of sound policies. In any case, the 104th Congress has mitigated the worst consequences of President Clinton's record on national defense and foreign affairs, and has provided balance against Clinton excesses, negligence, and irresponsible actions. Highlights of congressional accomplishments in national security include:
<ul>
<p><li>Making national missile defense a congressional leadership issue. Though the proposed Defend America Act of 1996 has yet to be enacted, it has given supporters of national missile defense the political initiative and has exposed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Clinton Administration on the most vital of all defense issues.
<p>


<li>As part of the missile defense effort, focusing attention on the need to withdraw or substantially modify the 1972 ABM Treaty and providing a statutory reminder that substantive changes in the Treaty must be brought before the Senate for advice and consent to ratification.

<p><li> Restoring needed funds to the defense budget to offset the severe, chronic budget shortfall inherent in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force levels and its five-year defense plan.

<p><li> Allocating substantial new funds to modernize the forces and rebuild combat readiness.

<p><li> Acting to renew the NATO alliance by a series of votes calling for enlargement of the alliance to include newly independent democracies in Central Europe.

<p><li> Cutting foreign aid and instituting organizational reforms in the State Department and in foreign operations accounts to eliminate waste and duplication.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's misguided policies in foreign and defense policy were a prime target of the Contract With America. Alarmed over Clinton's defense budget cuts and failure to move rapidly toward a national missile defense system, Republicans and conservative Democrats committed to the Contract promised to restore America's military strength. And early in the 104th Congress, they worked to fulfill their promise.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On February 7, 1995, the House of Representatives passed the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), which sought to establish a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall in defense, set a new policy for the development and deployment of missile defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the President to subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate did not take up H.R. 7, but parts of the bill did find their way into different pieces of Senate legislation, such as the defense and foreign relations authorization bills. While not all of the original Contract items were included in final legislation reconciling differences between the House and Senate -- for example, Congress dropped the House demand for a commission to examine U.S. national security strategy -- conservative supporters of the Contract delivered on the majority of their promises to the American people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress undertook a number of other foreign and defense policy initiatives that complement and supplement the national security planks of the Contract With America. For example, the new majority in Congress has endeavored to:
<p>
<b>Restore America's military strength.</b> Congress approved a defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget request submitted by President Clinton. This money was needed not only to keep America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but also to maintain a force with modern high-technology weapons in the 21st century. Because he needed congressional support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton bowed to demands from the Hill and signed the defense appropriations bill for FY 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his original defense budget request.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the President vetoed the accompanying FY 1996 defense authorization bill, which would have 1) provided more funds to maintain the technological superiority of U.S. forces; 2) authorized a pay raise and housing allowance increase for military personnel (including those deployed to Bosnia); and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S. homeland against ballistic missiles. The veto was narrowly upheld, and Congress found it necessary to weaken the missile defense provisions of the bill in order to secure its enactment with the President's signature.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the FY 1997 defense authorization bill, Congress has added more than $11.2 billion to the defense budget and has maintained a vigorous missile defense program -- or at least as vigorous as can be expected under the threat of another veto from a White House which gives lip service to missile defense while steadily undermining any real prospects for deployment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Move the United States closer to a national missile defense system. The FY 1996 defense authorization bill -- approved by Congress but vetoed by the President -- sought to establish a clear timetable for development and deployment of both national and theater missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the application of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater defense systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill, giving as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it contained. He prevailed, forcing Congress to weaken missile defense in the final 1996 defense authorization bill. Once again, the President succeeded in blocking this country's ability to defend its citizens from nuclear attack, and Congress was not able to muster enough votes to override his veto.
<p>

In the second session of the 104th Congress, both House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Defend America Act of 1996, which would mandate the development and deployment by a specific date of limited missile defenses of the U.S. homeland. This Act has not yet won approval, but the strong opposition of the Clinton Administration further illustrates the lengths to which the President is prepared to go to ensure the strategic status quo, which defends the 1972 ABM Treaty instead of defending Americans and leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.
<p>

<b>Cut foreign aid.</b> While the new Republican majority promised extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of revamping America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending on foreign aid will likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than it was in FY 1995. However, under the umbrella of a balanced budget by the year 2002, further cuts are likely. While current cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except aid to Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right direction is a new law requiring that the U.S. government report on the progress being made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets, the main engine of economic development. This effort was inspired by The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, a global comparison of economic freedom in 142 countries.
<p>
<b>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</b> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act just a few days after Cuba downed two U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international waters on February 24, 1996. This legislation, which tightens the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and allows American citizens to seek compensation for property stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening the end of Castro's dictatorship.
<p>
<b>Reorganize the State Department.</b> Congress proposed to cut waste in the State Department and foreign operations accounts by consolidating several independent foreign policy agencies within the State Department. This effort, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the support of Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic interests within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key legislation to move the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), Agency for International Development (AID), and other foreign policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President has vowed to veto this legislation if it is approved by Congress.
<p>
<b>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</b> In December 1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support the U.S. troops being deployed on the peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did not endorse the President's decision to deploy them, and also raised questions about the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear goals. The House went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission.
<p>
<b>Maintain America's trade relations with China by approving most-favored-nation trade status for China.</b> In June 1996, the Congress sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China. This decision reflects the belief, held by a majority in Congress, that increasing economic interaction is the best way to promote economic reform and advance political liberalization and human rights.
<p>
<b>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</b> In the face of Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit his alma mater Cornell University, Congress voted with near unanimity in May 1995 to support his visit. As a result, the President reversed course and granted the visa. Also, both the House and Senate have included provisions in the 1996 State Department authorization bill that would give precedence to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China government-to-government communiqu‚s when considering future weapons exports to Taiwan. U.S. China policy too often is framed by communiqu‚s that have no force of law, international or domestic. The Taiwan Relations Act, however, is the law of the land. The President has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.
<p>


<b>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the 104th Congress has done much to mitigate the Clinton Administration's negative impact on national security, much remains to be done. Working within its constitutional, budget, and oversight prerogatives, Congress needs to adopt a concerted strategy -- and initiate a legislative campaign based on that strategy -- to restore America's lost credibility abroad and dispel doubts around the world about U.S. leadership.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The first step is to continue the good work of the 104th Congress to reverse the neglect and decline of U.S. military strength that has characterized the Clinton Administration. Proper congressional action can encourage the development of a clear and coherent foreign and defense policy grounded in American principles and national interest, replacing the Clinton Administration's politicizing of defense and indifference to foreign policy, which have created only muddle and confusion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must ensure that the U.S. preserves the capacity to act unilaterally when U.S. interests are threatened. This means rejecting the false notion that U.S. power must be "legitimized" by operating through some international or multilateral agency like the United Nations. Congress must make sure that the Clinton policy of "assertive multilateralism" does not subordinate clear national interests to the U.N. and other supranational entities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to assert its prerogatives to prevent more dubious foreign interventions like Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia which turn the U.S. military into an international social work agency. Clinton's vague global utopianism has misused the military, gotten American soldiers needlessly killed, and wasted scarce defense dollars. If Congress does not intervene properly in such cases, American military strength and credibility will continue to be frittered away in "peace operations" which provide little or no benefit to the nation's security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to provide adequate funds and resources to preserve the core mission of the armed forces: to fight and win wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and existing military alliance commitments. Under Clinton, American fighting forces are weaker and less able to deal with larger military contingencies in areas like Korea or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In keeping with this duty, Congress must end the weakening of the armed forces caused by the imposition of a radical social agenda of "political correctness."  The President has imposed his radical vision on the military services by pushing women into combat positions before their effectiveness has been tested or their impact on combat effectiveness honestly evaluated. He has advocated the admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the ranks, contrary to the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The result has been a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Congress must intervene to protect the morale and combat effectiveness of America's fighting forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must also continue to press for deployment of the most effective theater and national missile defenses possible. If the President and his advisors continue to use the 1972 ABM Treaty as an excuse not to defend Americans from the growing threat of ballistic missiles, Congress should remove the Treaty as the chief impediment to meeting this vital requirement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many in Congress are unnecessarily intimidated by the prospects of dealing with the ABM Treaty. The Constitution establishes treaties duly ratified as part of the "supreme Law of the Land."  But the law of the land consists of the U.S. Constitution; "laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;" and then "all Treaties... which shall be made under the Authority of the United States" -- <i>in that order</i>. In other words, treaties are not supreme over statute law or provisions of the Constitution itself. Treaties, like the Constitution and other federal laws, are subject to change or amendment. They are not permanently unalterable like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. Congress may overturn the ABM Treaty by a simple statute declaring it null and void.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that have characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign and defense policy over the past four years are serious. They have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad and, unless rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great power capable of defending its values and interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For America, it is either lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security, and greatness; the second, to weakness and submission. For America's own well-being, and for that of the entire globe, U.S. leadership must be restored. If the Administration cannot or will not provide this leadership, Congress must hold it publicly and politically accountable and then, insofar as the Constitution and good public policy allow, step into the breach to safeguard America's national security.

Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the principal goals of government regulation is to protect the public and save lives. But how efficiently does today's system of regulation achieve that goal?  Federal agencies are criticized increasingly for imposing ineffective, costly regulations on individuals and businesses that do little to improve public health and safety. The criticism ranges from accusations of poor-quality science being used to estimate the magnitude of health risks, to the growing trend of agencies to regulate purely hypothetical health risks that likely pose no danger whatsoever. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year due to the current command-and-control system, chiefly by squandering billions of dollars on eliminating risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The traditional rhetoric of those who support the current regulatory system -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is simply wrong. Well-intentioned regulations can kill. Alarmists have succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would "roll back protection" -- for example, that women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e.coli</I> bacteria. This is untrue. A reformed system would allow us to devote more resources, not less, to the types of activities which we know save lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress has been unsuccessful in its efforts to frame the issues clearly for Americans. But, rather than passively allow the assertions of alarmists and regulatory extremists to go unanswered, reformers can and should seize the moral high ground in the debate over risk regulation. They should point out that their reforms and solutions actually will save more lives. In effect, they can help Americans get "more bang for the regulatory buck."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Reformers must understand and effectively communicate five simple truths about risk regulation to convince the public that regulatory reform will result in more protection, not less:
<P><ol>
<b><li>Not every risk is avoidable.</b> While eliminating every risk from life is desirable, it also is impossible. People make decisions every day regarding the types of risk they choose to face, and accidents do happen. A 100 percent risk-free, accident-free society is an impossible goal, and it is unwise for regulators to act as if it were achievable.<p>

<b><li>All risks are relative.</b> Almost everything we do every day carries some degree of risk. But some risks obviously are greater than others. Some risks may sound catastrophic while actually being relatively trivial because the likelihood of harm is so low. For example, many Americans still fear airplane flight despite clear evidence it is one of the safest modes of transportation available. By contrast, commonplace everyday risks such as driving to work pose a greater health hazard because they occur more frequently and the chance of accidents is greater.
<p>
<b><li>Wealthier is healthier.</b> Higher incomes increase living standards which, in turn, improve health and increase life expectancy. As the standard of living improves, overall public health and safety improves. Conversely, actions which lower living standards typically increase risk and shorten life expectancy. Thus, the more burdensome the regulations, the greater the drain on the economy and on the prosperity and health of Americans. This cost must be balanced against any benefit from a regulation.<p>

<b><li>Regulations can have adverse side effects, thus creating more risk and less protection.</b> While some regulation saves lives, some federal regulations actually cost more lives than they save by discouraging innovation, decreasing incomes, destroying economic output and job opportunities, and creating other new risks in pursuit of policy objectives. For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations meant to guarantee the safety of drugs or medical devices often delay the release of these products, placing millions more lives at risk.
<p>
<b><li>More lives would be saved if risks were prioritized.</b> If federal regulators identified and prioritized risks more effectively, as many as 60,000 additional lives could be saved each year.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These truths constitute the foundation of how to talk about risk regulation. This study is intended to help policymakers communicate in clearer terms the problems underlying today's system of risk regulation and describe a framework for reform.
<p>
<b>LIFE AND RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

We face risks every day of our lives. It is risky to eat, breathe, and walk down the street. Tragedy can strike from unknown and improbable sources. The world is full of risk, and no one is free from its dangers. But we also put ordinary risks in perspective. Even though people are constantly exposed to potentially dangerous circumstances, few decide to live in seclusion merely to avoid a slight chance of harm. While people wisely avoid unacceptable risks, they also wisely ignore or take only minor precautions against the vast majority of potential dangers facing them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Common sense tells us that risk is a relative matter. All other things being equal, less risk is better. But not all other things <I>are</I> equal -- sometimes it is better to accept small amounts of risk because the rewards are so great. In fact, humans do this every day when they risk poisoning by eating food or taking medicine or when they drive to work. The reason: Even with reasonable government protections and private precautions, there is a risk. But while the possibility of, say, food poisoning, remains real, usually it is very small and the alternative is unacceptable to most people. People calmly accept commonplace risks everyday. Life is a series of prudent trade-offs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, this is not understood by government bureaucrats who continue to craft regulations with the goal of eliminating all risk from society. These regulators, in an effort to be cautious and "safe," often impose great economic burdens on those they regulate to eliminate the slightest risk of death or injury. Even the smallest element of risk in society typically is deemed intolerable and unacceptable. The enormity of the cost often is irrelevant to regulators as they pursue a "zero-risk" or "no-risk" society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk trade-offs and opportunity costs.</b> While these policymakers are well-intentioned, they ignore the important point that risk is neither created nor eliminated in a vacuum. Every action has consequences. Any attempt to decrease or eliminate risk will entail a corresponding trade-off. Every action taken by an individual or organization means that other opportunities are closed off. Economists refer to these lost opportunities as opportunity costs. More specifically, the opportunity cost of a given action refers to the forgone benefits that could have been obtained by employing resources in an alternative way.<sup>1</sup>  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>On an elementary level, most people enjoy watching television as well as reading books or magazines, but understand there is a trade-off between the two at any given time. The opportunity cost of watching television is the lost chance to read.
<p>
<li>On a more complex level, the opportunity cost of prohibiting a business from hiring and paying workers at whatever wage they can afford may be an overall loss in employment and income for the economy.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<li>Likewise, federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which require increased fuel economy in American automobiles, undoubtedly have saved fuel. But this has come at the expense of many thousands of lives lost, because auto companies were effectively forced to manufacture much lighter-weight cars to meet the fuel economy standards, and these cars were not heavy enough to protect drivers and passengers as well in accidents.<sup>3</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In each case, a trade-off is made, although the trade-off may not be consciously understood. Consequently, opportunity costs are incurred. Such costs can range from very expensive to fairly trivial; hidden to visible; extremely complex to easily understood. Whatever their magnitude, there are real costs and trade-offs associated with every regulatory decision.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In an important new book, <I>Risk vs. Risk</I>,<sup>4</sup> John Graham, Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis and President-elect of the Society for Risk Analysis, and Jonathan Baert Weiner, Associate Professor in the School of Law and the School of Environment at Duke University, develop a conceptual framework (referred to as "Risk Trade-off Analysis" or "RTA") to help policymakers and the public better understand the nature of risk trade-offs. Graham and Weiner argue that the best way to understand the dangers inherent in the risk assessment process is to plot on a chart the relationship between "target risks" and "countervailing risks."  Target risks are those risks that regulations are designed to reduce. A countervailing risk is the unintended and undesirable consequence that results from attempts to reduce the target risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, consider Graham's and Weiner's hypothetical example of how someone might go about reducing the risk of a headache. To alleviate the target risk, the headache, the sufferer could take several aspirin. While taking several aspirin usually will lessen the headache, it often comes at the cost of a countervailing risk -- a severely upset stomach. As the chart below reveals, if the recommended remedy for the target risk is merely to take several aspirin while ignoring any side effects, improvements can be made along the target risk axis. Yet alleviating the target risk may increase the risk of severe stomach problems, moving us backwards on the countervailing risk axis. Thus, both types of risks must be acknowledged so that the proper balance can be struck or alternative treatments found to remedy the target risk without creating heightened countervailing risks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Risk Trade-off Analysis, as developed by Graham and Weiner, simply draws attention to the inevitable trade-offs policymakers face when attempting to eliminate target risks. Actions taken to alleviate target risks may come at the expense of heightened countervailing risks. When legislators and regulators ignore the opportunity costs of such trade-offs, the results can be unfortunate and even deadly. A clear case of this is the CAFE standard mentioned earlier. Increased fuel economy in cars (the target risk) was achieved, but at the expense of increased highway fatalities (the countervailing risk).
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Graham and Weiner provide many other examples of how RTA can be used to examine inefficient risk analysis:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Regulations aimed at decreasing solid waste in landfills from disposable diapers can decrease this target risk by encouraging increased use of washable cloth diapers.</b> Yet this produces a countervailing risk: more air pollution created by increased energy-intensive washing and household pickup services by high-polluting trucks.
<p>
<li><b>Banning the pesticide EDB may have eliminated the very slight cancer risk it posed, but only at the expense of a more dangerous cancer-causing fungus left on the food</b> that used to be treated with the pesticide.
<p>
<li><b>In 1991, Peru suffered a massive outbreak of cholera, which killed 7,000 people and afflicted over 800,000 others. This was caused by Peru's decision to ban the chlorination of drinking water, based on American risk studies</b> that had shown there might be a slight chance of developing cancer due to chlorine. But the chances of cancer death from chlorinated water turned out to be far less than the risk of death due to a contaminated drinking supply.
<p>
<li><b>Asbestos abatement efforts actually pose a greater risk to human health than non-action, since the substance has been shown to be virtually harmless if left alone.</b> Thus, regulations requiring asbestos removal not only have wasted scarce public health dollars, but also have placed workers removing it and others at greater risk from dust stirred up once it was agitated.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clearly, as shown by these examples, if Congress ever hopes to fix the grave problems of the current risk assessment and management systems, it must be aware of the opportunity costs that are inextricably entwined with all risk regulation trade-offs. While the benefits of some regulations may outweigh the cost, more often they do not. And that means lives are lost unnecessarily. Why is this the case?
<p>
<b>How Well-Intentioned Regulations Can Cost Lives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Attempting to save lives by trying to eliminate every risk from life actually can increase the overall death toll for many reasons. The primary reason: Avoiding one risk necessarily implies accepting others. Even in the United States, with a gross national product of $7 trillion, there are limited resources that can be devoted to reducing risk. At the very least, policymakers should acknowledge that saving lives by taking one action precludes using those same resources to save other -- and perhaps more -- lives. In many cases, if the private resources used in complying with federal mandates were left to the individuals affected, or used in other ways in the economy, Americans would benefit more. The country cannot afford to eliminate all risk, since trying to do so can reduce safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Supreme Court Justice Stephan Breyer noted in his 1993 study of risk regulation, <I>Breaking the Vicious Circle</I>, while it would be wonderful to eradicate every last bit of risk from life, trying to "go that last mile" can be pursued "to the point where it brings about more harm than good."<sup>5</sup>  Few additional gains are made in terms of public health and safety when such a strategy is followed, Breyer argues, since "[r]emoving that last little bit can involve limited technological choice, high cost, devotion of considerable agency resources, large legal fees, and endless argument."<sup>6</sup>  To better understand Justice Breyer's point, critics of the onerous current system must learn to speak in terms of "wealthier is healthier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Assuming the moral high ground: Why a higher standard of living keeps people safer.</b> Increasingly, academics, expert analysts, and even government officials argue that large increases in regulatory spending can result in more lives lost than saved. But while true, this is counter-intuitive for most people. After all, regulation ostensibly is designed to protect people, and this usually would be true if the benefits of regulation existed in a vacuum with no costs, including opportunity costs. Regulation neither exists in a vacuum nor necessarily corresponds with more protection; yet it always entails costs. When the cost of well-intentioned risk regulations is a corresponding decrease in the overall economic welfare of average citizens, the net result can be lost lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is an old saying that health is wealth. The converse is also true: Wealth is health. As <a href="tp13c2.gif">Chart 2</a> and <a href="tp13a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> suggest, comparing average national income levels to life expectancy and infant mortality in 132 surveyed countries reveals a strong correlation. More children survive and adults live longer in countries with higher incomes. Why does this occur?  There are many reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One reason is that increases in economic production make possible innovations such as medical technology, antibiotics, weather-resistant shelter, and safer modes of transportation. These factors in turn increase life expectancy. Another is that wealthy, robust economies encourage job creation, which also lowers deaths by reducing the ranks of unemployed workers, who suffer from higher mortality rates. Moreover, increased wealth extends life expectancy for those already fully employed by giving them opportunities to buy better food and shelter, purchase more health insurance, drive safer cars, and otherwise live a less stressful life. Furthermore, a healthier population produces even more wealth, so the wealth-health cycle becomes self-perpetuating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

These advances have done more to reduce the very real everyday risks Americans face than the great majority of risk regulations currently on the books. Despite "Chicken Little" claims by some alarmists, life is getting less risky all the time. The easiest way to see this is to compare turn-of-the-century life expectancy figures with today's. Total life expectancy in the year 1900 was just 48 years; today, it is 76 years. This remarkable 60 percent jump is due primarily to the ever-increasing standard of living enjoyed by Americans over the span of this century. Steadily rising incomes have allowed individuals and families to make ongoing investments in risk-alleviating measures that increase their health and that of their families. In fact, two scientists in the early 1980s estimated that for every 1 percent change in income, mortality is reduced by approximately 0.05 percent.<sup>7</sup>  Again, wealthier is not only healthier, but highly risk-reducing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is also worth noting that these large gains in human health and longevity occurred just as rapidly before the onset of most federal regulatory programs in the early 1970s as they have since. In fact, from 1900 to 1969, life expectancy at birth rose by an average of 0.8 percent per year (see <a href="tp13c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). By way of comparison, from 1970 to 1990, life expectancy grew by only 0.3 percent per year. Policymakers need to ask themselves how these amazing gains were made prior to 1970 without federal health and safety rules. The answer, of course, lies in the wealth-health phenomenon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Regulation: The other side of the story.</b> Regulations, including those that ostensibly are supposed to reduce risk, can cause fatalities whenever they destroy wealth, confiscate property, or discourage employment and product innovation. This should be taken into account whenever a regulation is proposed. Jobs are lost and wealth is destroyed when output is restricted, resources are used inefficiently, or entrepreneurialism in general is discouraged. Product innovation likewise is suppressed whenever government too strictly regulates the development, distribution, and use of products with life-saving potential.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Several recent regulatory and judicial decisions support this concept. For instance, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has noted that for each additional $7.5 million increase in the regulatory burden imposed on Americans, one human life is lost.9  According to OIRA, the reduction in economic activity due to the burden of regulation itself actually increases risk because living standards are reduced, and this causes mortality rates to rise. This increased mortality, however, reflects only the heightened risk caused by the economic effects of regulations and is separate from reduced risks that could be achieved by devoting expenditures to other uses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using this estimate:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $119 billion</b> to avert just one death under an OSHA-based formaldehyde occupational exposure limit, 331 new drugs could be developed and brought to market.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $168 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based benzene regulation, 3,064 police officers could be placed on the street.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Instead of spending $653 million</b> to avert one death under an EPA-based dichloropropane water standard, 4,353 new fire trucks could be purchased -- equivalent to 10 per congressional district.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The late risk expert Aaron Wildavsky made clear exactly why regulation can have such counter-productive effects. He explained that the quest for a no-risk society through overzealous regulation "is the highest risk of all"<sup>13</sup> because it prohibits or interferes with the enormously beneficial trial-and-error process that weeds out unsafe products or processes and replaces them with superior alternatives. As Wildavsky noted in his influential work <I>Searching for Safety</I>, proponents of a no-risk society demand "trial <I>without</I> error," which in reality is more deadly, since "[i]f you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out, you cannot do anything at all.... [I]f trying new things is made more costly, there will be fewer departures from past practice; this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards.... [E]xisting hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Those who support the current regulatory system apparently want policymakers and the public to believe that thousands of pages of new rules and hundreds of additional bureaucrats would do more to improve human health and safety than more police on the beat, more fire trucks in local communities, or more pharmaceutical drugs on the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In summary, because regulatory policy often requires that private resources be employed in sub-optimal ways, enormous costs are imposed on businesses and individual Americans alike.<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, as critics of the current system can now argue, these costs may often include the loss of human life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>A real world example: CLIA.</b> Take the case of CLIA, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Despite little evidence that any serious problems existed with current laboratory testing methods, Congress became fixated on a few highly unusual cases in which laboratory testing error contributed to the death of a patient. Congress felt that even a single fatality caused by testing error was one death too many. With truly noble intentions, legislators set out to insure lab tests would be perfectly safe from that point forward -- again, the creation of a "no-risk" society was the theme. Yet, despite these good intentions, the results have been less than encouraging and have placed the lives of average Americans at even greater risk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The eight-page law led to 1,600 pages of regulations as well as thousands of pages of additional guidelines. Faced with enormous paperwork costs and threatened with fines for non-compliance with this needless paperwork, tens of thousands of small private medical practices have been forced to stop administering basic patient tests or have shut down their operations altogether.<sup>16</sup>  As a result, the cost of routine laboratory tests for things such as strep infection, cholesterol levels, pregnancy, and Pap Smears has risen dramatically. With fewer patients (especially those who are poor) therefore able to obtain basic clinical tests, the overall quality of care has been reduced, and more lives are now at risk than before CLIA was passed. Good intentions have led to disastrous results. Thus, like many other regulations whose stated purpose is to reduce risk to society, CLIA is likely costing more lives than it is saving.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This real-world example provides several important lessons that apply to all risk regulation:
<P><ul>
<li><b>First, it illustrates that every regulation involves trade-offs and corresponding opportunity costs, including the cost of human life.</b> In the case of CLIA, trying to make labs completely safe is placing individuals at even greater risk.
<p>
<li><b>Second, it shows that "two wrongs don't make a right."</b>  A few chance accidents do not justify overzealous regulatory initiatives that actually create more problems than they solve. Again, it is not possible to avoid every single risk in life, and attempting to do so can lead to more harm than good.<p>

<li><b>Third, and most important, as economists Richard J. Zeckhauser and W. Kip Viscusi note, "When thinking about these tradeoffs, one should remember that improvements in mortality and morbidity have come primarily from technological progress and a higher standard of living, not from government regulation or private forbearance."</b><sup>17</sup>  Innovation, trial and error, acquired knowledge, and the corresponding benefits of progress and wealth expansion are the true keys to a safer, healthier society -- not a more onerous regulatory regime.
<p>
<li><B>Finally, where command-and-control tactics are used, whether by the FDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the EPA, or other regulatory agencies, fewer lives are being saved than many policymakers and average Americans have been led to believe.</b> In many cases, as with CLIA, lives may be lost because countervailing risks are being ignored.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When federal policymakers accept the validity of regulations such as CLIA without carefully considering the costs they impose, they fail to understand that resources are being used inefficiently and people often are dying as a consequence. Tammy O. Tengs of Duke University summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost."<sup>18</sup>  With federal regulatory spending growing without restraint,19 the conclusion is clear: The pursuit of a "no-risk" society through expensive and inefficient federal regulatory activity is killing Americans.
<p>
<b>How to Manage Resources Better to Reduce Risk</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The central question facing policymakers and regulators is how to obtain "more bang for the buck" when trying to reduce risk. Since economic resources in society are scarce, it is essential that policymakers examine the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to reduce risk. This requires a common reference point to measure benefits. In the scholarly literature on risk analysis, this is often done in terms of how many "life-years" are saved by a particular measure. Assuming an average woman's life span of 80 years of age, a measure that prevented her premature death at age 50 would save 30 "life-years."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In examining the cost-effectiveness of various kinds of risk-alleviating measures, recent studies using life-year analysis generally have grouped the measures into three categories: 1) medicine and medical treatments, 2) fatal injury reduction efforts, and 3) toxin control. Although rules and methods can be found in each category that save lives very efficiently, medical treatments typically generate the greatest life-year benefits for the least cost while toxin control measures produce few benefits at the highest   cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What generally saves the most lives?</b>  The most cost-effective way to save lives generally is to increase medical treatment and, to a somewhat lesser degree, to curb fatal injuries. Trying to save lives by regulating pesticides or other toxins, on the other hand, generally uses up far more resources and saves fewer lives -- meaning that shifting resources from toxin regulation to medical testing on balance typically would save lives. While it is true that some toxin regulations do save lives (for example, restrictions on the release of nuclear wastes), most do not fit into this category. A seminal study that recently surveyed 587 risk-reducing methods, programs, and rules reveals that the median cost per life-year saved -- or extending a single life by one year -- for toxin control measures is $2,800,000. In contrast, the median cost per life-year saved is $19,000 for medical treatments and $48,000 for fatal injury reductions.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just how cost-<I>ineffective</I> are the great majority of these toxin control measures?  To put the numbers in perspective, Graham notes, "the median toxin control program costs 58 times more per year of life saved than the median injury prevention program and 146 times more than the median medical program (see <a href="tp13c4.gif">Chart 4</a>)."<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is ironic since, intuitively, most policymakers and ordinary Americans assume that toxin control is perhaps the most cost-effective method of reducing risk. Many Americans generally have come to believe that federal regulations banning or severely curtailing the use of products that sound very dangerous are extremely cost-effective and represent wise public policy. It turns out that nothing could be further from the truth. For example, the following list of five federal toxin control regulations reveals the enormous costs that would have to be incurred by society in trying to save just one life-year for each of these regulations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If citizens were forced to incur these expenses to save one life-year per regulation, and if the regulatory costs for these five regulations were totaled, it would cost society roughly $189 billion for just five life-years saved. By way of comparison, spending $189 billion on developing new life-saving drugs typically would allow an additional 526 new drugs to be developed and brought to market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It should be noted that this does not mean the nation is now actually spending $189 billion to alleviate the risk posed by these five toxins. Rather, this is how much would have to be spent to save just five life-years. The numbers are extraordinarily large precisely because the risks being regulated are so small, perhaps even illusory. In reality, the nation now spends much less on implementing these five rules but does not buy five years of life for that amount.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Current policies = 60,000 extra deaths per year.</b> As noted earlier, an important new study by Tammy Tengs estimates the magnitude of this resource misallocation. In her doctoral dissertation at Harvard, Dr. Tengs notes that from a survey of 185 life-saving interventions: 
<P><blockquote>
	 Results indicate that we incur opportunity costs of approximately $31.1 billion, 60,200 premature deaths, or 636,000 years of life lost every year in order to maintain our present pattern of investments in these 185 life-saving interventions. At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars. This could be accomplished by simply attending to the cost-effectiveness of investment options.<sup>22</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Dr. Tengs notes, "[W]e pay a large price for this pattern of investments and policy makers would be well advised to examine whether retaining the status quo results in non-survival benefits that are worth the cost and loss of human life."<sup>23</sup>  John Graham observes bluntly, "This perverse pattern of investment amounts to 'statistical murder' of American citizens. Policy makers need to ask harder questions about whether our public health and environmental protection dollars are well spent."<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The bottom line:</b> If the current pattern of regulation and structure of costs continues, risks actually will increase for average Americans.
<p>
<b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given this misuse of resources and the corresponding costs of current federal policies and priorities, policymakers and regulators should reconsider how to reduce real risks to Americans. The aim should be to provide more protection at less cost. A better distribution of scarce societal resources to achieve this goal would:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Improve risk decision-making and minimize inefficient federal spending.</b> Risk assessment methods need to be improved (for example, by using sound science), and agencies need to establish a clear distinction between assessing risks and deciding how to manage them. Federal agencies should work closely with the scientific community to improve risk assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy decisions about how risk should be managed to influence how risk is determined. When a risk is identified, a policy decision is made about how to handle it. If certain federal toxin control efforts produce little or no benefit for society, however, they should be abandoned, since they waste resources that could be used better elsewhere. Other programs, such as fatal injury programs, also would be scrutinized to ensure that resources could not be used better elsewhere, such as for medical treatments.
<p>
<b><li>Require that decisions about how to manage risks be made with due consideration for scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns.</b> In those cases where governmental solutions are viewed as inevitable, regulators should be required to take into account all possible outcomes and potential side effects of their actions. Scientific, economic, and constitutional concerns all must be given due consideration in this process. Moreover, Congress should demand that regulators meet stringent standards of proof before allowing them to overrule individual action and choice. External peer review mechanisms and judicial review opportunities also should be established to guarantee accountability. Proper prioritization of serious risks will aid in this process.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Encourage market-based solutions that produce incentives to reduce risk.</b> Achieving a wealthier citizenry would do more to decrease risks and reduce mortality than most public programs. Better use of market pricing and strict enforcement of property rights claims through the common law system would produce risk-alleviating incentives. For example, by applying property rights to water usage in Scotland, river users have reduced pollution by others in the waterways since they have an economic incentive to conserve and keep clean the natural resources they now own.<sup>26</sup>  Fundamental reform of tort law that results in a fairer compensatory system and better deters harmful conduct without over-punishing behavior also would help achieve this goal.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Improve both public and private risk information efforts.</b> The public needs to understand the types of familiar risks they face everyday, such as being struck by lightning, and how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as exposure to a particular chemical in the community. This would ensure that individuals possess the maximum amount of information to make wise, safety-conscious decisions on their own. For example, smoking, alcohol abuse, poor dietary standards, sun tanning, dangerous recreation activities and vehicles, and other potentially hazardous lifestyle habits are among the most risky activities engaged in by most Americans, according to experts. However, government regulation is rarely the solution and traditionally has not been the approach in these areas. An informed citizenry, with the liberty to make personal decisions, is the optimal goal.
<p>
<b><li>Give states and localities the flexibility to target resources more effectively to address the risks they face.</b> States and localities can target resources more precisely to the needs of their communities, such as sanitation, hazardous waste cleanup, and traffic safety. Moreover, they are more likely to know and be more responsive to the unique needs and concerns of their citizens than are distant federal regulators. Restricting federal efforts to clearly interstate and national concerns in those cases where private, state, and local efforts fail would be a much more effective division of responsibility.
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Eliminating every risk from life is impossible. But in pursuit of the mirage of a "risk-free" society, regulators oftentimes pursue quixotic and unattainable goals that place the lives of ordinary Americans at even greater risk. The traditional rhetoric surrounding the debate over risk -- that increased regulation saves lives -- is fraudulent. Regulations can kill, especially when they are formulated as a rash response to hypothetical risks and divert resources from other activities that would reduce real risks. The new rhetoric of risk regulation must be based on sound science, prioritization, and an understanding of the wealth-health trade-offs government regulations force on society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, not all federal risk regulations can be eliminated. But those that regulate illusory risks can and should be eliminated. Moreover, other regulations that alleviate small amounts of risk often can be crafted in better ways or carried out at the state or local level to ensure that they are cost-effective and truly beneficial. Obviously, there is no one panacea that policymakers can rely on in determining whether federal intervention is necessary. Judgment is needed. But if the proper tools and concepts are applied consistently when contemplating legislation or regulation of risk, those judgments would be much more sound than they are today. In the end, many more Americans would live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

<li>Aaron Wildavsky, "Trial and Error Versus Trial Without Error," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> (New Brunswick, Conn: Transaction Books, 1988), p. 38. Wildavsky referred to "those opportunities to reduce <I>existing</I> harms that society forgoes when it decides to delay or deny the introduction of a new substance of technology" as "opportunity benefits" since "opportunity costs" refers only to goods or services that might have been purchased with the same resources. "Opportunity benefits," on the other hand, focuses on the beneficial results that could have come about if a different path had been followed. <I>Ibid</I>., p. 39.<p>
<li>Although almost all risk experts agree this relationship holds over the long run, the short-run effects of economic wealth and personal health are disputed. That is, as "permanent income" (average income over the long run) increases or decreases over time, health risks and mortality generally decrease. See generally Wildavsky, "Richer Is Sicker Versus Richer Is Safer," in <I>Searching for Safety</I> , pp. 59-75. However, fluctuations in "transitory income" (short-term income changes during business cycle upturns and downturns) do not always exhibit a similar correlation. In fact, some scholars have noted that a perverse relationship exists between health/mortality risks and short-term increases in income brought on by improving economic conditions. For example, some ailments such as heart attacks, accidents, and cirrhosis tend to increase with improving economic times since they often are the result of an increased tendency and ability among individuals to consume greater quantities of luxuries that may have adverse health effects. See John D. Graham, Bei-Hung Chang, and John S. Evans, "Poorer Is Riskier," <I>Risk Analysis</I>, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1992), pp. 333-337. In general, though, these are health risks that individuals accept despite the side effects associated with them. More important, permanent income is generally a more important gauge of overall societal well-being and is hurt by federal policies that generate enormous costs and produce few benefits.<p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The agriculture legislation recently enacted by Congress and signed into law (P.L. 104-127) by President Clinton marks the most dramatic change in U.S. farm policy since the current command-and-control programs were created during the Depression. Today's system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new legislation was based on bills first debated last year by Congress: the<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2195:"> Freedom to Farm Act</a> (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), and proposals advanced by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) during the consideration of balanced budget legislation. These bills called for sweeping changes in American agriculture policy to create freer markets, reduce subsidies, and generally permit farmers to run their businesses to take advantage of market opportunities rather than comply with bureaucratic regulations. The bills also were in line with calls for fundamental reform voiced by many farmers and research organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation. In <I>Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, Heritage analysts proposed last year that Congress immediately end all supply control programs, phase out subsidies, and end other restrictions on farmers.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
P.L. 104-127, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996, eliminates federal government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction programs. Farm subsidies for these crops are to be replaced by steadily decreasing, but fixed, "market transition" payments. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the FAIR Act failed to reform the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Allegedly an environmental program, the CRP actually has functioned more as a supply control program, more often than not paying farmers to take potentially productive land out of use. The CRP at least should have been reformed to allow farmers to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. The FAIR Act also failed to reform the sugar and peanut programs, which continue the archaic policy of restrictive allotments and quotas that gouge American consumers; nor did it eliminate the milk market orders which force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these shortcomings, the new farm legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous new opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of this restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston, using an econometric model of the agriculture economy developed last year by Heritage, the new law will mean:
<p><ul><b>
<li>Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li>Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<P>
<li>Taken together, the agriculture community as a whole thus will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion of income. 
</ul></b> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This increase in agriculture activity will have a "multiplier" effect on other industries, leading to a total economic boost to the nation of $74.6 billion between 1996 and 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The states in which farmers will be at least $1 billion better off over the next seven years are:

<h3>APPENDIX: <br>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</h3>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2002) under the Freedom to Farm Act, based on historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that, overall, about 95 percent of ARP and 50/92 land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each year through 2002 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2002 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in Freeing America's Farmers, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only 0.5 percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crops they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product would be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson point specifically to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that customers spend more when trade expands.<sup>2</sup>

<h3> HOW STATES CAN FIGHT VIOLENT CRIME: TWO DOZEN STEPS TO A SAFER AMERICA </h3>

By Mary Kate Cary<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No.  944/S<br>
June 7, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     Violent crime remains at intolerably high levels. Gang violence
is spreading across the country. And juveniles are committing more and
more serious crimes. At the same time, crime is becoming more ruthless
and wanton. Too many Americans -- especially residents of the inner
cities -- have become prisoners in their homes, behind bars and
chains. It is not surprising, therefore, that the strongest support
for tougher law enforcement is found among inner-city, largely
minority residents. (See Robert Rector, "A Comprehensive Urban Policy:
How to Fix Welfare and Revitalize America's Inner Cities," Heritage
Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton No. 12, January 18, 1993.) 
<P>
     Despite this plague, a powerful bloc of liberal lawmakers in
Congress prevented the passage of tough anti-crime measures proposed
by the Bush Administration. If President Clinton is to launch a war on
crime, he will have to overcome this resistance on Capitol Hill. 
<P>
     As Bill Clinton prepares his own initiatives on crime, he would
be wise to examine the recommendations of the report released last
year by former Attorney General William P. Barr. (For a copy of
Attorney General Barr's original report, "Combatting Violent Crime: 24
Recommendations to Strengthen Criminal Justice" and its "Citizen's
Checklist" of questions for state and local leaders, contact the U.S.
Department of Justice Public Affairs Office at (202) 514-2007.) The
report, entitled "Combatting Violent Crime," focuses on actions which
can be taken at the state and local levels. President Clinton should
call on governors and state legislators to act on the recommendations,
and he should frame federal legislation and policies to complement the
proposals.
<P>
     Real Results. When the federal government works with state
authorities, the combined assault on crime can yield real results.
Working with local police under "Operation Triggerlock," for example,
federal prosecutors were able to charge over 10,000 dangerous
criminals who used firearms in the operation's first eighteen months
alone (Summer 1991-Winter 1992). The average sentence for three-time
felons was eighteen years without parole. In another operation, 300
FBI agents were transferred from counter-espionage to anti-gang squads
in 39 cities across the country, and the federal RICO (Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations) statutes were used in many cases to
dismember violent gangs. Under the innovative "Operation Weed and
Seed," law enforcement resources were combined with social programs at
the local level to reduce crime in twenty targeted cities. And U.S.
Marshals, in one ten-week period, rounded up thousands of dangerous
fugitives in a massive manhunt named "Operation Gunsmoke."
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should continue to assist state and
local law enforcement officials in these ways. At the same time
President Clinton should build upon the progress made by Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush in strengthening the federal criminal
justice system. During the 1980s, federal legislation reformed bail
laws to establish pretrial detention for dangerous offenders;
sentencing guidelines were initiated to ensure firm and consistent
punishment; mandatory minimum sentences were created and federal
parole was abolished to bring the amount of time served closer to the
amount of time imposed in criminal cases. In addition, substantial
resources were invested in federal law enforcement. The number of
prosecutors and federal law enforcement officials increased
significantly, and President Bush doubled federal prison capacity in
just three years. 
<P>
     Framework for States.Nevertheless, the impact of federal policy
necessarily is limited, since 95 percent of crimes fall within the
jurisdiction of state and local governments. But state and local law
enforcement agencies, with limited resources, are under great strain
to deal effectively with the increase of violence in this country. To
fight violent crime on the state and local levels, Attorney General
Barr made 24 recommendations in his report. Developed in partnership
with a broad array of non-partisan law enforcement officials, these
recommendations are a sound framework for state and local policy
makers seeking tough action on crime. And if the Clinton
Administration should fail to follow through on candidate Clinton's
anti-crime rhetoric, or weaken existing law enforcement programs
through the appointment of liberal jurists to the federal bench, it
will be all the more important for state and local officials to
strengthen law enforcement in their jurisdictions.
<P>
     Already there is evidence that the Clinton Administration is
backing away from tougher law enforcement. President Clinton's first
budget, for instance, substantially cuts resources for the Department
of Justice, and emphasizes social programs at the expense of law
enforcement. The Clinton Administration's budget request for federal
prison construction was $155 million for FY 1994, down from the Bush
Administration's FY 1993 request of $195 million, about a 20 percent
cut. Clinton seeks to reduce prison construction funds to $112 million
by 1998, down from a high of $1.3 billion spent by Bush in 1990 alone.
<P>
     It also appears that the Administration's new crime bill will
reverse many of the legislative reforms enacted during the last
decade, as well as some 22 Supreme Court decisions considered
favorable to law enforcement. It is thus state and local officials who
likely will have to take the lead in the only real opportunity to
improve America's criminal justice system. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Barr's recommendations focus on five areas: 
<P>
     Protecting the community from dangerous criminals; 
<P>
     Assuring effective deterrence and punishment of adult and young
     offenders; 
<P>
     Creating more efficient trial, appeal, and post-appeal
     procedures; 
<P>
     Improving the detection and prevention of crime; and 
<P>
     Enhancing the role of the victim in the criminal justice process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>   
     Many of the Barr recommendations are modeled after effective
federal statutes enacted during the last decade. President Clinton
should build upon these improvements. And state officials need to take
decisive measures at lower levels of government. Barr's 24
recommendations provide a foundation for such actions.
<P>

<B> THE TIDE OF VIOLENT CRIME IN AMERICA </B>
<P>
     State officials must address a simple fact: The United States is
in the grip of a violent crime wave.
<P>
     As the above graph shows, the number of violent crimes has jumped
dramatically in the last thirty years, over three times the rate in
the 1990s than in 1960. Measuring the increase in terms of population
over the same time period, the U.S. population has increased by 41
percent, while the violent crime rate has increased by more than 500
percent. As Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow William J.
Bennett, former National Drug Control Policy Director, observes, "The
rate of violent crime in the U.S. is worse than in any other
industrialized country." (See William J. Bennett, The Index of Leading
Cultural Indicators, published jointly by Empower America, The
Heritage Foundation, and the Free Congress Foundation, Washington D.C.
1993, p. 2.)
<P>
     As noted, the victims of violent crime tend to be
disproportionately poor and members of racial and ethnic minorities,
particularly blacks. "Given current crime rates," observes Bennett,
"eight out of every ten Americans can expect to be a victim of violent
crime at least once in their lives." (Ibid.)

<P>
<B> PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES FROM DANGEROUS CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Most of the criminal violence in American society is committed by
a very small group of chronic, violent offenders -- hardened criminals
who commit many violent crimes whenever they are out on the streets.
They begin committing crimes as juveniles, and they go right on
committing crimes as adults, even when on bail, probation, or parole. 
<P>
     The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. If law
enforcement officials are to make any progress in reducing violent
crime, their top priority must be to identify, target, and incarcerate
these hard-core, chronic offenders.
<P>
     The Barr report indicates ways in which state legislatures can
take decisive action to protect citizens:
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #1: Give judges legal authority for pretrial detention
     of dangerous defendants.
<P>
     Every state should grant statutory, and if necessary, state
constitutional authority to its trial judges to hold, without bail,
those defendants who are a danger to witnesses, victims, or the
community at large -- both before trial and pending appeal. 
<P>
     A study by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) of individuals on pretrial release in 75 of the
nation's most populous counties found that 18 percent of released
defendants were known to have been rearrested for the commission of a
felony while on pretrial release. Two-thirds of those rearrested while
on release were again released. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants,
1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 1.
See also Lazar Institute, "Pretrial Release: A National Evaluation of
Practices and Outcomes," prepared for the National Institute of
Justice, U.S. Department of Justice, by Mary A. Toborg (October 1981),
Grant No. 71-NI-AX-0038, p. 48 (reporting similar rates of pretrial
rearrest).)
<P>
     This revolving door justice adds significantly to crime and
destroys public confidence in the criminal justice system. Law-abiding
citizens understandably are reluctant to inform police of criminal
activities when they know that those arrested will be back on the
street in a few days, or even in a few hours. Citizens fear
retaliation, intimidation, and harassment by returning criminals if
they help police. 
<P>
     Potent Tool. At the federal level, the Bail Reform Act of 1984
grants federal judges the authority to deny bail or pretrial release
to defendants who pose a danger to specific individuals or to the
community in general. (18 U.S.C. sec. 3141-56.) Under the Act,
criminal defendants with serious records, including the commission of
crimes while on release and those charged with serious drug felonies,
are presumed to be a danger to the community and therefore unsuitable
for release. The Act also creates a strong presumption that a
convicted offender will remain imprisoned during any post-conviction
appeal.
<P>
     Pretrial detention has helped federal prosecutors cripple
organized crime and drug rings. When pretrial detention is foregone,
defendants have the opportunity to intimidate or harm witnesses before
their trials. But when pretrial detention is enforced, dangerous
defendants are put behind bars until trial, where they are unable to
obstruct justice or pose a threat. Pretrial detention also increases
the protection afforded to witnesses and victims of crimes.
<P>
     Despite the proven effectiveness of the federal statute, and its
soundness as federal constitutional law, (The Supreme Court rejected a
constitutional challenge to the pretrial detention provisions of the
Bail Reform Act in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987).)
only a few states have effective pretrial detention provisions. In
many states, pretrial detention is not currently possible because of
an absolute right to bail in the state constitution. Thus where state
constitutional reform is necessary to remedy this, it should be
enacted. 
<P>
     States also should consider other key provisions of the Bail
Reform Act of 1984, such as the serious penalties for jumping bail and
enhanced penalties for crimes committed while on release.
<P>
     In Philadelphia in 1986, for example, a judge placed a limit on
the number of criminals that could be housed in the Philadelphia jail,
in order to prevent overcrowding. Released because of this order were
dangerous arrestees who otherwise would be held without bail or on
very high bond. The result was an increase in violent crimes committed
by the releasees. In the face of this crisis, the federal government
stepped in to use federal pretrial detention in cooperation with state
authorities. Over 600 gang members, who would have been turned loose
by state judges because there was no room to hold them, were placed in
federal facilities under federal law while awaiting trial. The
homicide rate in Philadelphia declined as a result. (See Mike Baylson
(U.S. Attorney ED-PA) and Willie Williams (Philadelphia Police
Commissioner), "Here's Why Murders are Down in the City," The
Philadelphia Inquirer, January 15, 1992, p. A13.)
<P>

<B> PUNISHING AND DETERRING VIOLENT CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Imprisoning the hard-core population of chronic, violent
offenders will reduce the level of violent crime in America. The
reason: When these criminals are on the streets, they are victimizing
citizens; when they are in prison, they are not committing crimes
against the public. While liberals may question the deterrent and
rehabilitative aspects of imprisonment, one thing is beyond debate:
Prison incapacitates chronic, repeat offenders.
<P>
     Consider the American experience of the last three decades. In
the 1960s and early 1970s, incarceration rates dropped and violent
crime rates skyrocketed. Conversely, when incarceration rates jumped
in the 1980s, the rate of increase of crime was substantially reduced.
(See Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice,
Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime Reports 1959-90 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, various years); Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Historical Statistics
on Prisoners in State and Federal Institutions, Year end 1925-86
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988) and
Prisoners in 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990).) This is all the more impressive, considering the mid-1980s
"crack" drug epidemic and its associated violence.
<P>
     The best way to reduce crime is to identify, prosecute, and
incarcerate hard-core criminals. Study after study shows that a
relatively small portion of the population is responsible for the
lion's share of criminal violence in this country. For example, one
California study found that 3.8 percent of a group of more than
236,000 men born in 1956 were responsible for 55.5 percent of all
serious felonies committed by the study group. (These numbers are
derived from Robert Tillman, "Prevalence and Incidence of Arrest among
Adult Males in California," prepared for California Department of
Justice, Bureau of Criminal Statistics and Special Services,
Sacramento, California (1987).)
<P>
     Putting chronic offenders in prison for long periods, especially
upon second and third convictions, is the most effective way to reduce
violent crime.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #2: Restrict parole and increase the time actually
     served by violent offenders.
<P>
     An axiom of effective law enforcement is that punishment should
be swift, certain, and severe. Yet in too many jurisdictions, it is
none of these. In fact, most violent offenders who are sent to state
prison serve only a small fraction of their sentences. According to
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, analysis of release practices in 36
states and the District of Columbia in 1988 shows that although
violent offenders received an average sentence of seven years and
eleven months imprisonment, they served an average of only two years
and eleven months in prison -- or 37 percent of their imposed
sentence. Overall, 51 percent of the violent offenders in the survey
were discharged from prison in two years or less, and 76 percent were
out in four years or less. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S.
Department of Justice, National Corrections Reporting Program, 1988
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), tables 2-7
and 2-4.) 
<P>
     The adjacent chart shows the median sentence and time served in
prison for those released for the first time on a sentence in 1988.
(Ibid.)
<P>
     This huge gap between the nominal sentence given and the real
time served is dishonest, and it is bad policy. It is dishonest
because the public -- especially victims of crime -- is often under
the impression that the sentence will be served in full, when in fact
no such thing happens. It is bad policy because it puts the public at
risk. 
<P>
     There are several reasons why states should restrict parole
practices. First, parole is based on the mistaken idea that the
primary reason for incarceration is rehabilitation (prisoners can be
released as soon as they are rehabilitated, so the argument goes), and
ignores the deterrent, incapacitative, and retributive reasons for
imprisonment. A clear and truthful sentence increases the certainty of
punishment, and both its deterrent and incapacitative effects. 
<P>
     Second, in too many cases parole simply does not work. Studies of
the continuing failure of parole obscure the terrible human cost to
law-abiding citizens. (See, for example, Mark Vosburgh and Sean
Holton, "Florida Prison Failure Churns Out Crime Before Its Time,"
Orlando Sentinal, August 13, 1989, p. A-12; Mark Vosburgh, "Florida's
Early Releases: Flood of Rearrests May Sink Crowded Prisons," Orlando
Sentinal, December 17, 1989, p. A-1; U.S. Department of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in
1983, April 1989 (NCJ-116261); U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of
Justice Statistics, Examining Recidivism February 1985 (NCJ-96501);
U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism
of Young Parolees, May 1987 (NCJ-104916).) For example, Suzanne
Harrison, an eighteen-year-old honor student, three weeks from
graduation, left her home in Texas with two friends, nineteen and
twenty years old, on May 4, 1986. Her body was found the next day. She
had been raped, beaten, and strangled. Her two companions were shot to
death, and their bodies were found ten days later in a ditch. 
<P>
     Their killer, Jerry Walter McFadden (who calls himself "Animal"),
had been convicted previously of two 1973 rapes, and sentenced to two
fifteen-year sentences in the Texas Penitentiary. Paroled in 1978, he
was again sentenced to fifteen years in 1981 for a crime spree in
which he kidnapped, raped, and sodomized a Texas woman. Despite the
fact that his record now contained three sex-related convictions and
two prison terms, he was released again on parole in July 1985.
McFadden's crime spree finally came to an end when he was convicted of
the capital murder of Suzanne Harrison and sentenced to death in 1987.
McFadden raped and killed Harrison and killed her two friends less
than a year after being released on parole. This tragic example is all
too common, and the cost of failed parole practices to the public
safety is all too high. 
<P>
     Parole sometimes is used as an answer to prison overcrowding.
This is hardly a reasonable justification for the premature release of
violent criminals into the community. The answer to a lack of prison
space is to build more prisons, not to release dangerous criminals.
<P>
     Until recently, the Texas prison system was not expanding rapidly
enough to house that state's criminals. Under federal court order to
remain at a maximum of 95 percent of capacity, the Texas prison system
responded by increasing the number of inmates released on parole. The
number of felons on parole increased by 430 percent during the 1980s,
(See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice,
Probation and Parole 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1982), p. 2; Probation and Parole 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1990), table 1.) and inmates served an
average of only 62 days for each year of their sentence. (See Texas
Department of Corrections, 1991 Fiscal Year Statistical Report,
Summary Table 4 (1992).) As a result, reported crime rates in Texas
increased 29 percent in the 1980s, according to the FBI, while they
fell for the nation as a whole. (See Federal Bureau of Investigation,
U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime
Reports, 1980, table 3 (1981) and 1989, table 5 (1990).)
<P>
     States should enact "truth in sentencing." Parole should be
restricted so that the sentence served more closely matches the
sentence imposed. While "good behavior" incentives may be used to
control prisoners, the mechanism should not exceed federal standards
requiring 85 percent of sentence to be served.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #3: Enact mandatory minimum sentences for gun
     offenders, armed career criminals, and repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In many states, sentences for violent crimes are too short. To
many criminals, jail time is little more than a brief cost of doing
business. For example, in 1988, of an estimated 100,000 persons
convicted in state courts of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated
assault, some 17 percent -- or about 17,000 violent criminals --
received sentences that included no prison time at all. (See Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Felony Sentences in
State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990), p. 2.)
<P>
     State legislators should enact mandatory minimum sentences for
aggravated crimes of violence, and for such crimes committed by repeat
offenders. Every state should follow the example of federal law, which
mandates imprisonment where a firearm is used or possessed in the
commission of certain serious felonies. (18 U.S.C. sec. 924 (c) (1).) 
<P>
     Every state should also enact laws similar to the federal armed
career criminal statute, which targets repeat violent criminals who
possess a gun. (18 U.S.C. sec 924 (e).) Under federal law, any person
who has been convicted of three violent felonies or serious drug
offenses, and who illegally possesses a firearm, is sentenced to at
least fifteen years imprisonment without possibility of parole. There
are graduated, lesser penalties for those who have been convicted of
one or more prior felonies and illegally possess a gun. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #4: Build more prisons.
<P>
     As former Attorney General Barr says: "The choice is clear: More
prisons or more crime." Building more prisons is not only the morally
right thing to do, it is also economically the right thing to do. As
Heritage Foundation scholar Robert Rector argues, crime is a high tax
on the economic life of America's cities. (Rector, op. cit.) The cost
to society of releasing violent criminals prematurely is far higher
than the cost of building and operating prisons. When a violent
offender is released after conviction because of insufficient prison
space, all the money used to apprehend, try, and convict the criminal
is wasted. And although incarcerating criminals is not cheap, the cost
of not incarcerating criminals is far more expensive.
<P>
     The overall cost of crime to victims -- including direct losses,
pain and suffering, and risk of death -- has been estimated in the
billions of dollars. (See Mark A. Cohen, "Pain, Suffering and Jury
Awards: A Study of the Cost of Crime to Victims," Law and Society
Review, Vol. 22 (1988), p. 539. Cohen estimated the 1984 aggregate
cost of crime to victims at $92.6 billion in 1985 dollars.) And this
does not include larger costs of crime to society, such as lost sales,
because people are afraid to go out shopping; lost jobs, when
businesses leave crime-ridden neighborhoods; and lost tax revenues,
when sales, businesses, and jobs no longer exist.
<P>
     A study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of a group
of career criminals found each had committed an average of 160 crimes
a year. (See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Department
of the Treasury, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the Federal
Armed Career Criminal Statute (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1992), p. 29; see also Jan M. Chaiken and Marcia R.
Chaiken, Varieties of Criminal Behavior, prepared for the National
Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice (Rand Corp., 1982),
p. 215.) A 1987 National Institute of Justice study estimated that the
average societal cost per crime in the nation was slightly more than
$2,300. (See National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of
Justice, Making Confinement Decisions (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1987), p. 4.) When these costs are
compounded with the multiple crimes committed by the chronic offenders
mentioned above, the cost to society of not incarcerating each
criminal could exceed $350,000 per year.
<P>
     Despite the huge costs of not incarcerating criminals, states are
reluctant to invest in prison space. In fiscal year 1990, only 2.5
percent of total expenditures by state and local governments went for
corrections. And investment in new prison construction was only a
small fraction of that figure, according to 1989-1990 figures on
government finances from the Bureau of the Census. (See Bureau of the
Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, Government Finances: 1989-90
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 2.)
<P>
     While there are those who argue that America is using prison
space for many people who do not belong there, the truth is that 93
percent of those in prison are repeat or violent offenders (the rest
are drug traffickers or burglars). (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Prisons and Prisoners in the United States
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), p. 16.) In
the face of the overwhelming need for more prison space, spending on
corrections remains a tiny percentage of state and local budgets.
States need to commit sufficient resources to building and operating
prisons, or risk the continuing collapse of the criminal justice
system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #5: Impose an effective death penalty for the most
     heinous crimes.
<P>
     The death penalty has an important role to play in deterring and
punishing the most heinous violent crimes. ( On the deterrent effects
of capital punishment: see generally Stephen J. Markman and Paul G.
Cassell, "Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet
Study," Stanford Law Review, Vol. 41 (1988), pp. 121, 154-56
(collecting studies that demonstrate deterrent effects of the death
penalty); Stephen K. Layson, "Homicide and Deterrence: A Reexamination
of the United States Time-Series Evidence," Southern Economics
Journal, Vol. 52 (1985), pp. 68, 75-80 (estimating that each execution
in the U.S. deters approximately eighteen murders). On its retributive
effects: see, for example, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
Establishing Constitutional Procedures for the Imposition of Capital
Punishment, S. Rep. No. 251, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), p. 13
("Murder does not simply differ in magnitude from extortion or
burglary or property destruction offenses; it differs in kind. Its
punishment ought to also differ in kind. It must acknowledge the
inviolability and dignity of innocent human life. It must, in short,
be proportionate.").) But it must be a real and certain penalty to be
effective. In addition to its deterrent value, capital punishment
permanently removes extremely violent offenders from society. And the
death penalty upholds society's goal of just retribution: It affirms
the moral outrage of the community at the ruthless taking of human
life and assures the victim's loved ones that society takes their loss
seriously. 
<P>
     At the very least, states should make the death penalty an option
for juries to consider in three situations:
<P>
First, it is appropriate for the killing of a law enforcement officer.
     This sends a clear message to violent criminals: Murdering a
     police officer to avoid identification or later arrest is not
     worth it, no matter how long a prison term the criminal faces.
<P>
Second, it is appropriate for those who kill while also committing
     serious felonies. In the California case of People v. Love, (366
     P.2d 33, 41-42 (Cal. 1961).) a collection of convicts' statements
     from police files and other sources indicates that their
     decisions to use toy guns during felonies, not to use firearms to
     resist arrest, and not to kill hostages were motivated by fear of
     the death penalty. The death penalty raises the stakes for these
     criminals, and therefore helps protect the victims of their
     crimes. 
<P>
Third, it is appropriate for killing while in prison. Many criminals
     already serving life sentences in jail feel they have little to
     lose by killing a correctional officer or fellow inmate. The
     death penalty introduces a new level of punishment.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #6: Require prisoners to work or perform community
     service to defray the costs of their imprisonment.
<P>
     Taxpayers pay for a prisoner's room and board, health care, and
all other expenses. In return, able-bodied prisoners should be
required to do something useful for the taxpayers, such as maintaining
prison property. Restrictions on this practice should be applied only
where there is a significant risk of taking jobs away from law-abiding
American workers.
<P>
     There are many benefits associated with prison work. The Federal
Bureau of Prisons recently published preliminary findings from its
Post Release Employment Project (PREP), which compared federal
convicts who received training and work in prison with a control group
which did not. The study's preliminary findings offer strong support
for prison labor programs: Inmates who worked in prison were less
likely to engage in prison misconduct, less likely to commit crimes
after release, and significantly more likely to be gainfully employed
one year after release. (See Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S.
Department of Justice, Post Release Employment Project, Preliminary
Findings (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991),
pp. 6, 10-11.)
<P>
     States should enact laws or promulgate regulations requiring all
able-bodied felons in prison to perform some labor useful to the
public. State legislators also should enact laws making a certain
percentage of the cost of each prisoner's incarceration part of a
mandatory fine imposed as part of sentence. Proceeds from both of
these should be used to defray correctional costs.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #7: Impose drug testing throughout the criminal justice
     process.
<P>
     Violence is a way of life for those who use and distribute drugs.
More than a third of state prisoners serving time for a violent crime
said they were under the influence of drugs at the time the offense
occurred. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of
Justice, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 1988 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 624.) 
<P>
     States should impose drug testing on those arrested for certain
felonies. This would enable judges to decide more appropriately the
conditions for pretrial release and sentencing after conviction.
Random drug testing in prison also would help cut use in prisons and
discourage the smuggling of drugs into prisons. In addition, periodic
drug tests generally should be required of prisoners on supervised
release after conviction for a serious felony, and the use of drugs
during probation or parole should result in automatic revocation of
release status. Finally, where possible, the cost of these drug tests
should be offset by a fee imposed on those tested. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #8: Seize assets to fight crime and to supplement law
     enforcement resources.
<P>
     Asset forfeiture is a one-two punch in the fight against crime.
First, it strips criminals of their ill-gotten gains -- it assures
them that crime does not pay. And second, it reinvests those assets as
funding for law enforcement programs. In fiscal year 1991 alone, the
U.S. Department of Justice deposited $643.6 million into the Asset
Forfeiture Fund and shared $266.8 million in cash and $21.2 million in
property with state and local law enforcement organizations as a
result of joint operations. (Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture,
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,
Annual Report of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund,
Fiscal Year 1991 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1992), pp. 53, 55.)
<P>
     States can use this sanction in addition to criminal prosecution
in drug trafficking and certain violent crime cases. Still, asset
forfeiture laws should also be applied constitutionally, with proper
regard for due process protections. To assist states in doing so, the
Department of Justice, with the National District Attorneys
Association and the National Association of Attorneys General, has
developed a Model Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Act which contains a
comprehensive set of recommendations for states.

<P>
PUNISHING AND DETERRING YOUNG CRIMINALS
<P>
     Juvenile crime has risen rapidly over the last two decades,
especially violent offenses. The real answer to this problem lies
outside the criminal justice system. As Heritage Foundation scholar
Robert Rector demonstrates, it is the basic institutions of society --
family, schools, churches, and neighborhood groups -- that instill
values and mold children into good citizens. (Rector, op. cit.) Only
when these institutions once again intervene effectively in shaping
the lives of young Americans will juvenile crime be cut substantially.
<P>
     Still, law enforcement has a key role. State legislators and
officials need to distinguish between categories of juvenile
offenders. The vast majority of juvenile offenders have only one or
two brushes with the law and straighten out as they mature. But there
is a smaller group of chronic hardened juvenile offenders, who commit
most of the violent juvenile crime. Unfortunately, juveniles are the
fastest growing group of violent offenders. As the following graph
shows, the arrest rates of juveniles for violent crime have increased
significantly in recent years, particularly since 1985. (Bennett, op.
cit., p. 4.) And the increase in juvenile crimes is responsible for a
large share of the general increase in violent crime. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Age-Specific
Arrest Rates and Race-Specific Arrest Rates for Selected Offenses,
1965-89 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), pp.
31, 73, 213.)

     <P>
RECOMMENDATION #9: Toughen juvenile sanctions to deter nonviolent
     first-time offenders from a life of crime. 
<P>
     In the case of the first, larger group of juvenile offenders, the
goal of policy makers and law enforcement officials is to prevent
these youths from becoming chronic offenders. The best way to do this
is to impose tough sanctions that are carefully tailored to the
offender and are meant to instill the values of discipline and
responsibility. Excessive leniency, on the other hand, wastes the
opportunity to turn the young person around, and instead puts him or
her on the conveyor belt to becoming a career criminal. The juvenile
does not get the message that crime does not pay when he or she is not
penalized for committing a crime. Tough but fair sanctions can stop
the all-too-common pipeline from juvenile offender to adult criminal. 
<P>
     To this end, state officials should develop a range of sanctions
for nonviolent first-time juvenile offenders, with the emphasis on
instilling discipline and responsibility in a tough but fair manner.
To be effective, these sanctions should include institutional
settings, including "boot camps" and highly structured community
service programs, as an alternative to probation. And the use of these
structured sanctions must be for a period long enough to bring about a
change in the pattern of behavior.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #10: Target the small group of chronic violent juvenile
     offenders and treat them as adults.
<P>
     One of the worst statistics from the 1980s is the sharp increase
in the number of juveniles arrested for murder: It rose by 60 percent
between 1981 and 1990, according to the FBI. The corresponding adult
increase was 5.2 percent. In 1990, more than a third of all murders in
America were committed by people under the age of 21. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the
United States, Uniform Crime Reports, 1990 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1991), tables 27 and 36.) The growth of
violent juvenile gangs and the tendency of drug rings to use young
teens as drug couriers, enforcers, and even "hit men" have contributed
to this alarming trend. There is an attitude of "Let the kid do it"
among criminals on the street, because of the leniency of many state
juvenile justice systems.
<P>
     For example, in 1988 a fourteen-year-old drug runner in the
District of Columbia shot and killed three people on the same day. The
drug dealer for whom the juvenile worked was convicted of felony
murder, but the juvenile served only 26 months in juvenile detention
for the killings. He was back out on the streets taunting local police
before his seventeenth birthday. (See "D.J.," Washington Post
editorial, July 31, 1991, p. A20.)
<P>
     State criminal justice officers must realize that some youthful
offenders are simply hardened criminals who happen to be young. The
challenge for state officials is to identify this small group of hard-
core offenders and treat them as adults -- which may require some
reform of existing procedures.
<P>
     State legislators should ensure, for example, that their legal
systems permit the discretionary waiver or certification of juveniles
into adult court in appropriate circumstances. One approach would be
to create a legislative presumption that any juvenile age fourteen or
older who commits certain crimes of violence (murder, rape, kidnaping,
armed robbery, for example) will be tried as an adult. The presumption
could be rebutted by showing mitigating factors that argue otherwise. 
<P>
     But where violence is involved, a firearm is used, or multiple
offenses have occurred, the youth has already -- through his own
willful criminal conduct -- left the intended focus of the juvenile
justice system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #11: Allow judges to use juvenile offense records in
     adult sentencing.
<P>
     Many seemingly first-time adult offenders in this country were
chronic offenders as juveniles, yet evidence of their crimes may not
be available or may be considered legally irrelevant to sentencing for
adult crimes. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 38
percent of convicted murderers in state prison in 1986 had a prior
juvenile conviction; and 13 percent of those had no adult record, only
juvenile ones. (The figures are similar for other violent crimes. For
example, 54 percent of state prisoners convicted of robbery as adults
had a juvenile record -- 15 percent had only prior juvenile
convictions. These figures are based on the raw data underlying the
BJS Special Report, Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988).) While it is commendable
to forgive a youthful indiscretion and not penalize an otherwise law-
abiding adult with a criminal record, that is hardly reasonable when a
juvenile offender continues a life of crime into adulthood.
<P>
     To address this problem, the FBI now includes juvenile criminal
history information from the states in the national criminal records
system, and states are urged to forward records of serious offenses to
the FBI. So that this is possible, state officials should review their
expungement and confidentiality statutes affecting juvenile offenses.
State laws, moreover, should allow for the fingerprinting of juveniles
convicted of serious crimes, and career criminal statutes should
provide that juvenile convictions for serious drug and violent crimes
be considered relevant factors in the sentencing of adults.
<P>

<B> PROMOTING FAIR AND SPEEDY TRIALS AND STREAMLINING THE APPEALS PROCESS </B>
<P>
     While it is essential for state officials to increase the
certainty and severity of punishment, it is equally important to
ensure its swiftness and finality. The key to this is the ability of
the criminal justice system to seek and find the truth. Several steps
would help achieve this, substantially enhancing the efficiency of
state criminal justice systems and the deterrent effect of their
punishments.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #12: Enforce speedy trial laws.
<P>
     Victims of crime and members of society at large want to see
justice done and criminals removed quickly from society. Defendants
have an interest in clearing their good names if innocent, or in
beginning to serve their sentences if guilty. All sides have an
interest in determining the facts while evidence and the recollections
of witnesses are still fresh.
<P>
     Despite the clear common interest in speedy trials, and despite
the fact that some form of speedy trial law exists in 45 states, (See
Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Prosecution
of Felony Arrests, 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1986), table 30.) delays in prosecution still pervade many
state systems. In fact, a 1988 study of felony convictions in 300
counties across America found that the average time between arrest and
sentencing was 208 days -- even longer in violent felony and drug
trafficking cases. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department
of Justice, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), p. 7.) 
<P>
     These delays benefit no one but the guilty -- and cause
particular anguish and even danger to the victims of violent crime
awaiting the trial proceedings. Many docket-management techniques are
available to clerks and other state officials to help states ensure
criminal trials take place at the earliest possible date. They should
be used more aggressively.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #13: Reform the rules of evidence to secure the truth
     in criminal trials. 
<P>
     The cost of keeping probative evidence away from juries in
criminal cases is very high, and can result in the release of guilty
criminals to further victimize the innocent. State officials should
review their evidentiary rules to ensure that they promote the search
for truth.     
<P>
     State laws also should allow for admission of evidence seized by
officers acting with an objectively reasonable belief that they are
complying with the law. State legislators can, for example, ensure by
statute that whenever police officers act in good faith, but make a
technical error of law or fact, the evidence should nevertheless be
admitted in court. (In recent years, the Supreme Court has identified
a number of situations where it has declined to apply the exclusionary
rule to enforce the Fourth Amendment; primary among these is the 1984
case of U.S. v. Leon.) Colorado, for example, has enacted a good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule for both warrant and warrantless
cases. In some states, however, this may require a constitutional
amendment.
<P>
     State officials also should review evidence rules governing the
use of prior convictions or acts. There are two settings in which this
is particularly important. The first is in the impeachment of a
defendant who takes the stand. Traditionally, any past conviction for
a felony or a crime involving dishonesty was admissible to impeach the
credibility of the witness. Now, Federal Rule of Evidence 609 imposes
a general ten-year time limit on admissible convictions and requires a
special determination by the judge that the probative value of a
defendant's prior felonies outweighs any prejudicial effect.
<P>
     At a minimum, state evidence codes should be no more restrictive
than Rule 609. Allowing the admission of all convictions involving
felonies and crimes involving dishonesty against all witnesses
(including a defendant) would be even better.
<P>
     Second, many state evidence rules limit the use of past criminal
conduct of the defendant as evidence of guilt. Evidence that the
defendant has committed the same type of crime in the past is
particularly probative in sex crime cases, such as rape and child
molesting, where it shows common modus operandi or other relevant
factors. Studies suggest that recidivism runs high among a substantial
percentage of sex offenders, (See, for example, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Special Report, Recidivism of
Prisoners Released in 1983 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1989), table 10.) and such information may be key to an
informed evaluation of the credibility of the defendant's denial and
the victim's allegations. In such cases, often the only eyewitness is
the victim, who carries the burden of proof in the trial. State
legislators should provide clear statutory authority for the admission
of evidence of past sex offenses whenever the charge is sexual assault
or child molestation.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #14: Reform state habeas corpus procedures and end
     repetitive challenges by convicted criminals. 
<P>
     In recent years, the writ of habeas corpus has been transformed
from a monument of individual liberty, protecting individuals from
imprisonment without trial, into a device used by prisoners to
reexamine endlessly the issues decided by a full trial, and often even
after unsuccessful appeals. The result: a sapping of judicial
resources, a diminishing of punishment, and a continuing torment of
victims of violent crime.
<P>
     State officials should thoroughly review their habeas corpus laws
to deter frivolous litigation and to close loopholes that can be
abused. Four specific reforms would help improve many state laws:
<P>
States should allow only truly collateral claims to be raised in state
     habeas corpus cases. Any claim that was or could have been
     brought forward in a prisoner's direct appeals should be barred
     explicitly from habeas proceedings.
<P>
States should adopt explicit time limits for the filing of habeas
     corpus petitions (as there are for other categories of cases,
     from tort suits to contract claims), beginning from the time the
     petitioner has concluded his direct appeals.
<P>
States should bar successive habeas corpus petitions, except where
     sufficient cause is shown for previous failure to raise the claim
     and the claim, if proved, would address the prisoner's factual
     guilt. 
<P>
States should adopt the retroactivity standard of the 1988 Supreme
     Court case Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989)) which provides
     that changes in the law after trial and appeal will not apply
     retroactively unless they prohibit a particular crime or
     sentence, or greatly improve the truth-seeking function of the
     trial.
<P>

<B> DETECTING AND PREVENTING CRIME </B>
<P>
     Police and prosecutors in this country are in general doing an
excellent job. But their efforts are often frustrated by a cumbersome
and bureaucratic system that does not give them the tools they need to
get the job done. These tools include proper equipment, better
training, and the appropriate legal authority to apprehend and convict
violent offenders. Law enforcement is not just another line item in
the state budget -- it is the first duty of government. State
legislators should realize that something is wrong if this is not
reflected in budgetary priorities.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #15: Invest in quality law enforcement personnel and
     coordinate social welfare programs with law enforcement
     resources.
<P>
     Members of the police force today are often outgunned by drug
traffickers and gangs, who have access to high-powered weapons and
ordnance. The police need top quality equipment. States should make
sure their officers have adequate firepower and should make body armor
available to every officer. Use of body armor should be mandatory for
officers charged with the execution of arrest and search warrants. 
<P>
     Prosecutors likewise deserve and require adequate tools. In the
face of increasingly complex cases involving money laundering,
racketeering, search and seizure, and intricate drug distribution
rings, specialized training is often needed but not always available.
Likewise, state judges and clerks of court, handling ever-larger
criminal caseloads, need adequate support staff and equipment for case
management. 
<P>
     State officials should in addition coordinate law enforcement
resources with other public expenditures. While it is true that law
enforcement cannot do the job alone, it is also true that social
programs cannot succeed without effective law enforcement. (For a
comprehensive strategy of social and welfare reforms, coupled with a
law enforcement program, see Rector, op. cit.) What good is it to
build the finest schools, only to have them taken over by gangs? What
good are costly improvements in public housing, if units then are
converted into crack houses for drug dealers? Community revitalization
efforts must be combined with tough law enforcement to successfully
reduce violence and improve the lives of those held in its grip. (See
Carl F. Horowitz, "An Empowerment Strategy for Eliminating
Neighborhood Crime," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 814, March
5, 1991.) The "Weed and Seed" concept, a model program begun by the
Department of Justice in 1991, does just this. Federal, state, and
local law enforcement agencies pool their resources to "weed out"
targeted street gangs and drug dealers. Social programs can then take
root in the crime-free area, "seeding in" opportunity and hope for
residents. Between the two elements, community policing acts as a
bridge, so that police and community groups can build a productive
relationship to help prevent crime from resurfacing in the
neighborhood.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #16: Computerize criminal history records in a
     reliable, accurate, and timely fashion.
<P>
     Quick access to accurate criminal history records is important
for two reasons: First, criminal history records are necessary in
deciding pretrial detention issues. A past record of violence or
failure to appear is crucial information to a judge deciding whether
to detain a defendant. Second, reliable criminal history records are
the key to effective career criminal statutes, important for general
sentencing purposes, and vital for resource planning in the justice
system. Also, a criminal records data base is the foundation for a
point-of-sale check prior to firearms purchases. 
<P>
     Many states have serious problems with delays and backlogs in
reporting the final disposition of cases. These delays can mean a
three-month lag, or longer, between the end of the trial and the entry
of the data. To help alleviate this problem, the Department of Justice
set aside $27 million in 1992 to be made available to the states over
three fiscal years to upgrade the quality of their criminal history
records systems. In addition, since late 1992, all states must
dedicate at least five percent of federal formula grants from the
Department of Justice to improve their criminal history records (at
present levels this would total more than $21 million in additional
federal dollars each year).
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #17: Give prosecutors statutory authority to tighten up
     and target the rules for immunity from prosecution.
<P>
     Offering immunity selectively often is the only way of breaking
into drug enterprises, violent gangs, and sophisticated organized
crime operations. Accomplices and lower-level gang members often are
the only eyewitnesses to suspected crimes by superiors in a criminal
organization.
<P>
     Prosecutors also often must grant immunity to witnesses in order
to prevent them from asserting their Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Federal prosecutors have the choice of granting
two types of immunity: "Use" immunity prohibits the government from
using the compelled testimony, either directly or indirectly, to build
a case against a witness. It is possible, however, to prosecute based
on other independently gathered evidence. "Transactional" immunity
protects an immunized witness from prosecution for any criminal
transaction mentioned in the compelled testimony. Prosecution is
barred by transactional immunity even where independent evidence of
criminality is discovered. 
<P>
     Right now, state laws are a hodgepodge on the subject of
immunity. Despite the fact that the United States Supreme Court has
held that "use" immunity is constitutionally sufficient, several
states still provide only for transactional immunity, which eliminates
forever the opportunity to prosecute these witnesses even if the
evidence of their crimes was gathered independently of their
testimony. In addition, several states provide for automatic
transactional immunity to all grand jury witnesses. 
<P>
     State immunity laws should be comparable to the federal immunity
statute (18 U.S.C. sec. 6002.) -- prosecutors should be granted the
authority to request immunity and to decide whether it should be use
or transactional. Otherwise, investigations can be thwarted, and
clever witnesses can literally get away with murder. (See New York
State District Attorneys Association, "The Case for a New Immunity Law
in New York" (1988), p. 6.)
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #18: Allow the use of sophisticated electronic
     surveillance technology.
<P>
     With the advent of large-scale illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime cases, especially those involving Asian gangs and Cosa
Nostra families, electronic surveillance of suspects is essential. The
leaders of these organizations often are able to avoid direct
involvement in crimes while planning and coordinating increasingly
sophisticated criminal activity over the phone. Electronic
surveillance can build an extremely effective case by using the
criminal's own words, while also avoiding the risks of using
undercover agents or informants.
<P>
     One way to penetrate sophisticated criminal networks
electronically is to use a "pen register," a device which records the
outgoing numbers dialed from a telephone. The United States Supreme
Court has held that the use of a pen register is not a search within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus neither probable cause
nor a warrant is needed to use one. (See Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S.
735 (1979).)
<P>
     Conversely, a trap-and-trace device, like Caller ID, reveals the
phone number of all incoming calls to a particular number. In order to
use such a device, federal law requires police application to a court
and a showing that the information obtained from its use will be
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. (18 U.S.C. sec.
3121-27.) The statute, while creating a legal obligation for phone
companies, landlords, and others to assist police in the installation
of these devices, also provides protection for law enforcement
officers and telephone companies from civil and criminal liability for
actions taken under the statute.
<P>
     Currently, some fifteen states make no provision for court-
ordered electronic surveillance. Others, such as California, have weak
electronic surveillance laws. Others require warrants and probable
cause. 
<P>
     State legislators should review these laws to ensure that
statutory authority exists for electronic surveillance, pen registers,
and trap-and-trace devices. Statutory and constitutional change should
be made where needed.
<P>

<B> ASSURING VICTIMS' RIGHTS </B>
<P>
     Criminal justice serves a twofold purpose: to bring criminals to
justice, and to bring justice to victims. One way to make sure that
appropriate weight is given to victims' rights is to codify and
enforce a "Victims' Bill of Rights." Congress did just this in the
Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and urged the states to
follow suit. Victims of a crime have the right to be protected from
further violence, to expect restitution from financial loss, and to
participate in the criminal justice process. And the criminal justice
system should do all it can to lessen the pain of victims and victim-
witnesses. 
<P>
     Potential victims of crime also have the right to protection.
Victims of stalkers, for instance, should not have to wait until they
are attacked to have effective recourse. State legislators should
enact stalking laws that make it a crime to harass or follow a person
if it puts the victim in fear of death or serious injury. If a
restraining order is in effect at the time of an attack, an enhanced
penalty should be considered.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #19: Give victims a hearing and consideration at
     sentencing.
<P>
     In most states, defendants have the right to address the court
after conviction and before sentencing -- to tell their story and to
ask for mercy. State officials should provide the victim with a
similar right to inform the court about the impact of the crime on his
or her life before a sentence is given. The right should be extended
to victims' families in capital cases. Likewise, parole statutes
should provide that the impact of early release on victims or their
survivors be a consideration bearing on early release decisions or
other discretionary actions of the parole authority.
<P>
     The victim also should have a right to be present at all public
court proceedings related to the crime, which is often the most
traumatic thing that has ever happened to that person. Victims deserve
the right to watch the criminal justice system address the wrong done
to them.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #20: Help victim-witnesses with case coordinators.
<P>
     Victim-witness coordinators are an important link between victims
of crime and the criminal justice system, keeping victims apprised of
developments in the case, informing them of possibilities of
restitution, and notifying them of the release status of the offender.
Victim-witness coordinators should be made more aware of the state
programs funded through the Victims of Crime Act, and such services
offered by programs for victim compensation and assistance,
counseling, and even shelter for battered women.
<P>
     
RECOMMENDATION #21: Assure restitution, adequate compensation, and
     assistance for victims of crime.
<P>
     While every state has some type of victim restitution law, not
all are well enforced. Effective mechanisms for collecting fines and
restitution payments must exist, so that victims are relieved of the
humiliating task of having to chase down the offender personally to
obtain recompense for their injuries.
<P>
     State officials should also make sure that any profits a criminal
makes directly or indirectly from his crimes -- including from book
and movie deals -- are made available to the victim for restitution.
Where possible, states also should provide for reasonable compensation
for victim-witnesses, including payment for travel and loss of work
time, and assistance with day care and similar costs of giving
testimony.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #22: Adopt rules to protect victim-witnesses from
     courtroom intimidation and harassment. 
<P>
     Every state should enact two evidentiary protections for
complaining witnesses. The first is the rape-shield law. A good model
is Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which makes reputation or opinion
evidence concerning the past sexual behavior of the alleged victim
inadmissible in the trial for sex crimes. Admission of such evidence
violates the victim's privacy, increases the trauma of the trial, and
discourages victims from coming forward in the first place.
<P>
     Second, every state should protect child witnesses from traumatic
confrontations with their alleged abusers. In the 1990 case of Craig
v. Maryland, the Supreme Court noted that placing a child witness in
proximity to an alleged abuser or molester may do serious
psychological damage, and may overwhelm the child so much that he
cannot accurately testify to events. 
<P>
     The Maryland statute, upheld by the Supreme Court in Craig,
provides a useful model. If the trial judge deems it necessary, the
child's testimony is taken by closed-circuit television with only the
attorneys and, if necessary, a guardian present.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #23: Require HIV testing of sex offenders before trial.
 <P>
     Because of the AIDS epidemic, sex crimes have become even more
terrifying and traumatic for victims. At the request of the victim,
states should provide for mandatory HIV testing of defendants in
sexual offense cases before trial, in order to reduce the uncertainty
victims must endure. Test results should be available to the victim
and to the court in a way that safeguards the victim's
confidentiality. Also, at the request of the victim, defendants should
be tested again periodically, consistent with the latency period of
the HIV virus. Most important of all, states should provide enhanced
penalties for HIV-positive offenders who commit sexual offenses in the
knowledge that they may transmit the virus to the victim.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #24: Notify victims of all criminal justice proceedings
     and the release status of the offender.
<P>
     Many victims of crime understandably fear that they will be
victimized again by the same offender after his release. Victims
should be told of any change in a convicted criminal's status, such as
enrollment in work-release programs, weekend furlough, or community
incarceration. States should also ensure that adequate protective
measures be taken before release, where there is a legitimate fear of
more victimization.

<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     On the federal level, President Clinton should use the power of
his office to continue the federal effort against crime. In so doing,
he should build upon the progress of his predecessors, Presidents
Reagan and Bush, in strengthening the criminal justice system. 
<P>
     At the same time, state legislators and judicial officials can
and should take concrete steps to make America safer. Concerned
citizens, victims of crime, and law enforcement leaders are working to
strengthen the criminal justice system. Law-abiding citizens, however,
are asking if their state and local public safety laws are as
effective as those of the federal government and the more rigorous
states. They want police and prosecutors to have the tools they need
to combat gangs, drug dealers, and chronic violent offenders. They
want states to ensure that dangerous criminals are in prison, not in
their neighborhood. And they want victims of crime to have the same
say as the criminals do in the system. The recommendations of the Barr
report provide a sound foundation for making the fundamental changes
necessary to protect the safety of all Americans.

<P>

Communications at the Department of Justice. She is currently a

American criminal justice system.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Congress soon will have an opportunity to promote the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The measure to accomplish this task is Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>), sponsored by Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and <a href="http://www.house.gov/talent/welcome.html">James Talent</a> (R-MO). The bill would assist families in areas with high rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and poor schools. Through serious tax incentives and regulatory relief, coupled with innovative school reform pilot projects and home ownership incentives, the bill would achieve:<ul>

<p><li>Increased job creation;

<p><li>Small business expansion and formation;

<p.<li>Moral renewal;

<p><li>Expanded educational opportunities;

<p><li>Greater private philanthropy to aid the poor; and

<p><li>Greater participation by religious organizations in providing services to the poor.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Far too many of America's urban and rural neighborhoods are characterized by large numbers of people in poverty, as well as by juvenile crime, illegitimacy, joblessness, and female-headed households. Because companies are not investing in these areas, local economic growth and opportunity are hampered. And quick-fix short-term solutions, such as raising the minimum wage, do little to help improve the lives of people entangled in a web of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The problems of these communities are related to weaknesses of the local economy and the weakening of the moral and social fabric of the community itself; for policymakers to view the decline of these communities as the result of only one or the other prevents them from bringing about real and sustainable reform. Congress needs to strip away regulatory and institutional barriers that thwart rebuilding the broken lives and economies of these areas. The adoption of a wholly new and comprehensive urban policy of the sort that is embodied in the Saving Our Children bill would help the citizens of these communities achieve a better life for themselves and their children, not just by creating a far more favorable climate for business activity, but also by empowering the citizens of these communities to become active decision makers in their own lives and the lives of their children rather than merely passive subjects of the decisions of inflexible government social service and education bureaucracies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent studies have shown that a comprehensive approach to community development is the best way to bring substantive change to distressed and impoverished communities. It also appears that the social programs that work best are community-based. Such local initiatives are the most effective means of attacking the often difficult problems that individuals and families have with joblessness, poor education, crime, drugs, and welfare dependency. For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of families in poverty face multiple obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency.<sup>1</sup>  For many years, government agencies have tended to focus on single issues, such as housing or health. But policymakers increasingly are realizing that a piece-by-piece approach to urban policy is not likely to succeed. As Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros puts it, "We believe the best strategy to community development is a community-driven, comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community and human needs."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill gives Congress and the Administration an opportunity to act on this commitment and change the way the federal government has been involved in community development over the last 30 years. By lessening federal regulations and taxes, and increasing parents' freedom to choose schools that reflect their ideals, the communities that need the most assistance can serve as local laboratories of reform, generating ideas and inspiration for various other communities across the nation, as well as for policymakers in Washington.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE SAVING OUR CHILDREN BILL DOES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill has five main elements. The first two apply to the 100 "renewal communities" created by the bill. The remaining three major reforms apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>1. Creation of Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Title I creates up to 100 renewal communities across the nation, based on the degree to which an area is characterized by poverty and distress. Through tax relief, regulatory reform, and savings incentives for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients, this title would aid the poorest communities in the nation. Specifically, it would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> federal, state, and local tax and regulatory relief through provisions such as 100 percent capital gains tax exclusion on qualified assets held within a renewal community for at least five years.

<p><li><b>Enhance and increase</b> community involvement and ownership, in part through the creation of Family Development Accounts. These accounts would encourage EITC recipients to save money tax-free for certain expenditures such as higher education or buying a home for the first time.

<p><li><b>Improve</b> the delivery of local government services by encouraging privatization and increases in efficiency.

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2. Education Scholarships for Poor Children within Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As a condition of becoming a renewal community, a locality would administer the federally funded Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program established under Title IV of the bill. Low-income parents within the renewal community would be given federally funded scholarships to send their children to primary and secondary schools chosen by the parent. Poor parents would be able to use these scholarships to choose to send their children to a variety of schools, including alternative public schools, private schools, and private religious schools. Because religious schools can play a critical role in rebuilding the moral foundation of America's inner cities, they are included as an essential component of the scholarship program.

<p>
<b>3. Charitable Contribution Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To encourage charitable contributions to private organizations aiding the poor, the bill would create a tax credit that refunds 75 percent of a taxpayer's contribution to any private charity engaged primarily in providing direct services to the poor. The maximum eligible contribution would be $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers. The credit would be available to all federal income tax filers nationwide, regardless of whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.
<p>

<b>4. Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Until now, religiously affiliated drug treatment centers have been hampered in their ability to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act. Title III of the bill would amend current law to allow such organizations to receive federal funds for the treatment services they provide without restricting their religious activity. In addition, this section recognizes that religious education and religiously motivated drug treatment personnel can have a vital and important role in effective drug treatment. Thus, it would loosen unnecessary bureaucratic credentialing requirements on treatment staff which may bar religious drug treatment programs from receiving federal drug rehabilitation funds. These provisions would apply nationwide.

<p>
<b>5. Work Opportunity Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
With teenage unemployment at nearly 20 percent, this provision gives employers tax incentives to hire individuals who are welfare recipients or "high-risk" youth, the persons who have a more difficult time securing permanent employment. This tax provision also would apply nationwide.
<p>

<b>CREATING RENEWAL COMMUNITIES</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title 1, state or local governments would apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) to have certain depressed areas designated as "renewal communities."  Up to 100 such communities would be created nationwide. To qualify under the terms of the bill, the local area must be low income, and local authorities must agree both to ease regulations that impede economic activity and to operate the scholarship program for poor children provided in Title IV. If more than 100 localities applied to become renewal communities, HUD would select the 100 poorest. Upon becoming a renewal community, a locality would receive substantial tax and regulatory relief. Designated renewal communities would retain their status for seven years.
<p>

<b>1) Eligible Areas.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To become one of the 100 renewal communities, a local area would have to be nominated by a state or local government officials and would have to meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p><li>The locality must be an economically depressed area within a larger city or county.

<p><li>The locality must be characterized by pervasive poverty and distress and entirely located within the jurisdiction of a local government eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funds (according to Section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974). This means that a renewal community must be a subsection within the jurisdiction of a local government that is itself characterized by poverty and distress, not simply a pocket of poverty within an area of general affluence.

<p><li>The unemployment rate within the locality must be 1 1/2 times the national unemployment rate.

<p><li>Each census tract within the locality must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent.

<p><li>At least 70 percent of the households within the locality must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of local government.

<p><li>The locality must have a continuous boundary and be located within the jurisdiction of one local government.

<p><li>If any part of an area is located within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population greater than 50,000, the minimum population within the renewal community area must be at least 4,000. For all other non-rural and non-MSA areas, the population within the proposed community must be at least 1,000 or located entirely within an Indian Reservation.

<p><li>Ten percent of the renewal communities must be in rural areas. For an area to be considered "rural," it must be within a local government jurisdiction with less than 50,000 people, be outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census bureau, or otherwise be considered rural by the Secretary of HUD.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2) Required Commitments by Local Officials.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For an area to become a renewal community, state and local government officials and representatives of neighborhood organizations must express in writing their commitment to reduce taxes, regulations, and burdens on businesses within the renewal community area in at least five of the following seven ways:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Reduce</b> taxes and fees;

<p><li><b>Increase</b> the level of efficiency of local services;

<p><li><b>Develop and implement</b> crime reduction strategies;

<p><li><b>Streamline</b> government requirements and regulations;

<p><li><b>Foster</b> coordination between and involvement of private organizations and community groups, and encourage such groups to provide jobs and job training, technical, financial, or other assistance to employers, employees, and other residents from the renewal community;<sup>3</sup>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> state or local income tax benefits for fees paid for services, such as trash collection, that formerly were performed by the government but now are privatized; and

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> the donation or sale of land, homes, and commercial/industrial structures to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.
</ul><p>

<b>3) Required Economic Growth Measures.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To establish a renewal community, state and local officials must repeal or suspend government regulations, except for those required to protect health and safety. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>License requirements</b> for occupations that do not require a professional degree;

<P><li><b>Zoning restrictions</b> on home-based businesses that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Permit requirements</b> for street vendors that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Zoning and other restrictions</b> that impede the formation of schools and child care centers; and

<p><li><b>Restrictions on competition</b> for businesses providing public services, such as cable TV, taxicabs, or trash removal.
</ul>
<p>
<b>4) Tax Breaks to Stimulate Jobs in Poor Neighborhoods.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enterprise Zones, if crafted correctly, hold great promise in restoring economic vitality to poor neighborhoods.<sup>4</sup>  Experience with "enterprise zones" has shown that targeted tax relief on business activity in depressed inner city areas over time can cut the unemployment rate in those areas by a third or more.<sup>5</sup>  To create jobs and stimulate business activity in local communities, the Watts-Talent bill will match tax cutting and deregulation at the local level with a sharp reduction in federal taxes within the locality.
<p>
<b>Exclusion from Capital Gains.</b> Once a local area has been designated a renewal community, the bill would reduce federal taxes on private investment in any qualified renewal community enterprise (defined as a business that derives at least 80 percent of its gross income from within the community and has at least 35 percent of its employees living in the renewal community). The tax benefits for investment in qualified businesses within the renewal community area include a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax. An individual would not be taxed for any capital gains resulting from the sale of assets of a qualified renewal community enterprise held for more than five years. This exclusion is limited to $100,000 per tax year and a $500,000 total.
<p>
<b>Deduction of Stock Purchases.</b> Individuals in these communities would have the option to deduct certain purchases of stock of qualified renewal community enterprises instead of taking the 100 percent exclusion from capital gains.
<p>
<b>Deduction for Tangible Property.</b> Individuals and businesses in these communities also would have reduced up-front taxation on investments in tangible property within the renewal community. Under current federal income tax law, businesses and individuals may deduct up $17,500 from their federal income tax to cover current year capital investment costs.<sup>6</sup>  Under the Watts-Talent bill, an extra $35,000 could be deducted for investment in renewal community businesses.<sup>7</sup>
i<p>
<b>Tax Credit for Revitalization.</b> To encourage the renovation of decaying buildings that often blight impoverished areas, Section 107 of the bill gives taxpayers a tax credit equal to a percentage of their qualified revitalization expenditures within the renewal community. A person either could receive up front a tax credit of 20 percent of revitalization expenditures for the tax year a revitalized building is completed or could elect to receive a credit of 5 percent each year for ten years, beginning with the year the building is completed. The maximum expenditure for which a taxpayer may receive credit is $10 million. The building may not be a residence and must be located within the renewal community, and the revitalization costs must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure.
<p>
<b>Establishing Family Development Accounts for Renewal Community EITC Recipients.</b> Section 106 of the bill also authorizes the creation of Family Development Accounts (FDAs) designed to encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or their Earned Income Tax Credit refund. Cash donations would be deductible, even if the individual does not itemize. Withdrawals from these accounts would be tax-free if the money is used for certain specified expenditures. Contributions to FDAs would be limited to the lesser of $2,000 or the total amount of a person's compensation included in gross income for a given tax year. Persons donating to the family accounts of others would be limited to a deduction of $1,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Family Development Account funds can be used tax-free for the following expenses:
<ul>
<p><li>Post-secondary education tuition and expenses;

<p><li>First-home purchasing costs;

<p><li>Business capitalization expenditures, including capital, plant, equipment, working capital, and inventory expenses, with such businesses required to have an approved business plan;

<p><li>Medical expenses not otherwise covered by insurance; and

<p><li>Qualified rollovers which involve paying into another individual's FDA with funds from one's own account.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If an employer paid into a worker's FDA, the employer's contribution also would be counted as compensation. Matches also could be provided by state or local governments, service organizations, corporations, local churches, foundations, or other such organizations.
<p>

<b>5. FDA Matching Fund Program Demonstration Areas. </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could select up to 25 communities, with a minimum of two rural areas and based on their relative impoverishment, to serve as demonstration areas for an FDA matching fund program. Within these areas, each qualified individual would have an amount, equal to the amount deposited into the FDA account by the individual, matched by the federal government. This matching amount would be limited to $1,000 each year. The maximum one person could ever receive from the federal government is $2,000.

<p>
<b>6. Community Reinvestment Act.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
To encourage financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities, Section 501 of Title V directs that such efforts be taken into account when assessing an institution's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 USC 2903).
<p>
<b>7. FDA Application Fees.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
Section 502 waives "application fees" required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a drug developed within a renewal community.

<p>
<b>LOW-INCOME EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to become a renewal community, local officials also must agree to operate the bill's Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program for poor children within the community. The program provides federally funded scholarships to enable poor parents to send their children to a broader range of primary and secondary schools. It has two goals:
<ul>
<p><li>GOAL #1: To expand educational opportunity for poor children by giving their parents a broader range of choice in determining where the child goes to school; and
<p><li>GOAL #2: To foster moral renewal in a community by enabling poor parents to send their children to religious schools which teach moral principles and instill virtue as an essential ingredient of education.
</ul><p>
<b>Parental Right of Choice.</b> Parents would be eligible to receive funds under the scholarship program for their children if (a) they live in the designated renewal community; (b) the family income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line; and (c) they have elected to participate in the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parents of children who received financial assistance under this program would be free to choose from a wide range of types of schools, including alternative public schools, charter schools, private schools, and private religious schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A parent would be able to redeem a scholarship at any private or private religious school within the locality which meets the health and educational standards for private schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, 1996.<sup>8</sup>  All schools which redeemed these special scholarships would be required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and not to discriminate on the basis of race.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require renewal communities to give parents timely information to enable them to make informed decisions about the education of their children. At the very least, the information would have to explain the scholarship fund, describe the eligibility requirements and selection procedure, and provide information about alternative public schools and scholarship schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A locality would have to allocate scholarships and transportation aid to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-served basis or through another mechanism of selection determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the basis of the type of school selected by the parent. The scholarships are not entitlements.

<p>
<b>Types and Value of Scholarships for Poor Children</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far too many poor children are trapped in poorly performing schools. Funds under the program are intended to broaden the educational choices of poor parents and children within the renewal community. If the parents chose to send their child to an alternative public school where tuition is already paid, under the bill they would receive funds to cover the costs of transportation. If they elected to send their child to a private school, they would receive a scholarship for the child which could be used only to pay for tuition and educational fees at the selected school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each locality would determine the precise monetary value of scholarships for children in their locality. The bill establishes the range of local options, but the maximum value of the scholarship also must not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a public school in the locality. Further, the scholarship must have minimum value, which shall not fall below the lesser of a) 60 percent of the average cost of educating children in the public schools in the locality during the preceding year or b) the normal tuition charged by the private school.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each renewal community would be given a fixed amount each year to pay for scholarships and transportation aid for poor children. If the number of low-income parents who applied for scholarships and or transportation aid was insufficient to utilize all the funds available, any surplus funds could be used to assist in educating low-income children within the community's public schools.
<p>

<b>Poor Parents, Poor Children, and Religious Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans are increasingly concerned about the character and quality of the social order, the apparent decline in the culture, and the corrosive influences of that culture on family life and the moral condition of the country. These concerns are common to Americans, regardless of their racial or income group or where they live and work. For a variety of reasons, individuals and families, children especially, are even more vulnerable to social pathologies, including violent crime, illegal drug use, and illegitimacy and family breakdown.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Importance of Religion.</b> A central goal of the  Saving Our Children bill is to foster moral renewal in inner-city communities wracked by crime, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and family disintegration. The sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is the most important aspect of a child's education and that moral renewal is critical to solving urban social problems. The power of religion to help the poor help themselves is amply documented.<sup>11</sUP>  Investigating the condition of black inner-city youth, Richard Freeman of Harvard University finds that boys who regularly attend church are 50 percent less likely to engage in crime than boys of similar backgrounds who do not attend church; they also are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 47 percent less likely to drop out of school.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boys and girls who attend church regularly are two-thirds less likely to engage in sexual activity in their teens. Regular church attendance halves the probability that a woman will have a child out of wedlock.<sup>13</sUP>  Children attending religious schools are two-thirds less likely to drop out than are nearly identical children who attend secular schools.<sup>14</sup>  Children ages 10 to 18 who do not attend church are a third to a half more likely to exhibit anti-social and dysfunctional behavior.<sup>15</sUP>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Social consequences follow from school choice.<sup>16</sup>  The bill therefore helps poor parents give their children a sound moral upbringing by allowing them to use scholarships to send children to religious schools.
<p>
<b>Constitutional Issues.</b> The Supreme Court has held that as long as the parent, not the government, decides where the scholarship will be spent on a child's behalf, public funds can be used for education in a religious institution because the government has neither advanced nor inhibited a particular religion and therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.<sup>17</sup>  For example, in the 1986 case of <I>Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,</I> Larry Witters, a blind man, wished to use state vocational funds to attend religious seminary to help him fulfill his personal goal of becoming a minister. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that Witters's use of state vocational funds to attend seminary did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted:
<blockquote>
	It is well settled that the Establishment Clause is not violated every time money previously in the possession of a state is conveyed to a religious institution. For example, a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barriers.<sup>18</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justice Marshall further argued that it was permissible for Witters to use government vocational funds to attend seminary because the individual, not the government itself, was determining how to allocate the money:
<blockquote>
	Any aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. The decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not the state.<sup>19</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, local officials may not prohibit poor parents from using the Watts-Talent scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to place their child in a religious school. If provisions of a state constitution prohibit state and local funds from being spent at religious institutions,<sup>20</sup> the renewal community can segregate all federal funds from state funds. But state and local officials may not prevent poor parents from using federal scholarship funds designated for poor children to pay for tuition in religious schools.
<p>

<b>Eligible Schools and Civil Rights Safeguards</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To receive scholarships, a school must comply with relevant anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and also must satisfy applicable state and local requirements for curriculum and facilities and meet health and safety standards which existed as of January 1996. Schools are ineligible, however, if they advocate criminal behavior or are operated by an organization advocating criminal behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sponsors of the bill are careful to ensure that the scholarships will not become a Trojan horse leading to a government takeover of private or religious schools. The bill includes specific safeguards both to protect private schools which redeem scholarships from government intrusiveness and to protect the liberty of religious schools:
<ul>
<p><li>No additional regulations on burdensome paperwork may be imposed on private schools which redeem scholarships;

<p><li>Private schools redeeming scholarships will not be subject to regulations restricting religious instruction and shall be protected by the rights granted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;

<p><li>Any religious school may require its employees to adhere to its religious tenets and moral code of behavior;<sup>21</sup> and

<p><li>Private schools will be permitted to operate as single-sex institutions, or to operate classes separated by gender (Section 409[b][6]).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's language also includes a critical clarification to protect personal and religious liberty: No provision may be construed to give the federal government authority to direct or control the curriculum, administration, or personnel of any private school participating in the scholarship program (Section 410[c]).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require evaluation of the effects of the scholarship program. It authorizes studies comparing the performance of children with similar backgrounds to determine whether those from renewal communities who participate in the scholarship program outperform those who do not. In addition, the authorized studies would examine parental involvement and the degree to which it is improved when parents are able to choose where they send their children to school.

<p>
<b>Targeting Education Funds to Poor Communities</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal scholarship funds would be channeled to renewal communities through two funding tiers, with 80 percent of the funds allocated through the first tier. Under the first tier, the share of federal funds received by a renewal community shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of poverty residing in the community, relative to the total number of such low-income children residing in all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twenty percent of scholarship funds must be allocated through the second tier. To encourage private-sector and state and local government contributions to the scholarship program, second tier funds are to be divided according to the level of non-federal financial support given to the program within each locality. The share of these funds given to a specific renewal community would be equal to that community's pro-rated share of non-federal contributions to the scholarship program within all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>

<b>REINFORCING AMERICA'S INDEPENDENT SECTOR</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To an increasing degree, Americans realize that government solutions to poverty enacted during the latter part of this century have failed. Since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965, the U.S. has spent $5.4 trillion to aid low-income Americans.<sup>22</sUp>  But in many ways, poor communities are worse off now than when Congress started to establish this vast array of federal social programs over 30 years ago. The following provisions would apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>A Charitable Tax Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Saving Our Children bill creates a new tax credit, intended to encourage Americans to allocate more of their charitable contributions to private organizations that are fighting poverty effectively with low administrative overhead. According to Section 201 of Title II, taxpayers who donate to a qualified charity would receive a 75 percent tax credit for donations up to $200 for single and $400 for joint filers. This credit would be available regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes deductions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A charity is qualified to receive donations under this provision if its predominant activity is the provision of direct services to individuals whose annual incomes generally do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line. A qualified charity must provide direct services to low income persons and may not participate in political activities such as lobbying, litigation on behalf of service recipients, public policy advocacy, public policy research, or voter registration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers, because they are closer to the needs of their communities, are better able to make decisions about where funds should go than are bureaucrats in Washington. They can target funds to programs that work. Giving taxpayers additional means with which to make financial contributions to worthy poverty-fighting organizations would enable them to become more involved in their communities, fostering a greater sense of civic duty and fellowship.
<p>
<b>Using Faith-Based Drug Treatment Centers</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 301 of Title III (Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse: Services Provided through Religious Organizations) applies nationwide. It amends the Public Health Service Act to meet three goals:<ul>

<p><li><b>To permit</b> faith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive federal assistance and to prohibit discrimination against such centers;

<p><li><b>To make</b> it easier for individuals receiving federally funded drug treatment to select drug treatment therapy that is religious in nature; and

<p><li><b>To protect</b> the rights of individuals receiving drug treatment by ensuring that no individual can be required to receive services from a religious organization and guaranteeing that individuals who do not wish to receive drug treatment services from religious entities must be provided with alternative secular services.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faith-based drug treatment is different from secular treatment in that it encourages a person to look beyond himself for the strength to overcome addiction. That apparently is why faith-based treatment is more effective than secular treatment: Individuals in any religious denomination or group have lower levels of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance.<sup>23</sup>  Likewise, religion has been shown to be a powerful force in helping alcoholics abstain from alcohol. For over half a century, Alcoholics Anonymous has encouraged participants to invoke a higher power to help them recover from their addiction.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992 that the "role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b>Eliminating Discrimination.</b> Under Title III of the bill, religious organizations are eligible to receive program funds and provide drug treatment services on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization. While religious organizations would be required to meet the general requirements for effective drug treatment, neither the federal government nor any state government receiving federal treatment funds shall discriminate against an organization because of its religious character. Neither the federal nor any state government could interfere with the definition, practice, or expression of an organization's religious beliefs; nor could they require the organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, sacred scripture, or other such symbols. Religious organizations which receive funds under the bill also could require any or all employees to adhere to their organizational religious and moral tenets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, the language of the bill would protect the religious liberty of drug users receiving treatment. Any person who objects to participating in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization shall be given the option of receiving treatment in an alternative program operated by a secular organization.
<p>
<b>Personal Help.</b> States may provide beneficiaries with vouchers that enable them to choose among a wide variety of drug treatment programs under Title III. If a person needing drug treatment is given a voucher or other mode of reimbursement which enables that person to select the treatment program in which he will participate, the drug treatment monies may be used for any religious worship and instruction which is part of the overall drug treatment. This provision is fully in accord with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the religious establishment clause in <I>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District , Mueller v. Allen, and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind.</I>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If a person with a drug abuse problem freely elects to participate in a religious drug treatment program rather than secular alternatives, the individual could be required to follow the rules set forth in the program and to participate in any religious practice or instruction that is part of the treatment program. Any individual who does not wish to participate in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization is given the full right to refuse such treatment. Such individuals must be given the option of attending an equivalent alternative secular treatment program.
<p>
<b>Broadening Help for the Addicted.</b> The bill's language also stipulates that state or local governments should recognize that religious education can have a critical role in providing effective drug treatment. In applying education qualifications as a condition for receiving federal funds, state or local governments would have to give credit for religious education that is equivalent to the credit given for secular course-work of similar grade levels and duration. Furthermore, any religious organization which is barred from receipt of federal drug treatment funds by means of education and credentialing standards imposed by state or local government could appeal to the Secretary of Labor to waive such standards. The Secretary must waive the standards if:
<ul>
<p><li>The organization has provided effective drug treatment for at least three years;
<p><li>The Secretary determines the requirements for education and training of personnel effectively bar the organization from receipt of funds; and
<p><li>The state or local government is unable to demonstrate empirically that such qualifications are necessary to have a successful drug treatment program.
<p>
</ul>
<b>CREATING REAL JOBS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, found in Section 201 of Title II of the bill, is designed to encourage the employment and economic betterment of those whose past makes it difficult for them to secure a job and make a fresh start. The bill would replace the expired Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). The Work Opportunity Tax Credit offsets the cost of hiring persons who fall into a number of categories, including AFDC or food stamp recipients and their families; economically disadvantaged veterans, ex-felons, and high-risk youth; vocational rehabilitation referrals; and qualified summer youth employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employers would be eligible to claim a 35 percent credit on the first $6,000 of first-year wages paid to a qualifying individual (for a maximum credit of $2,100). In the case of certain summer youth, employers could claim a 35 percent credit on $3,000 of wages (for a maximum credit of $1,050).
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has an opportunity to change the direction of American social policy. The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 contains a new comprehensive strategy to help resolve America's urban problems. It assumes that the choices and decisions of low-income Americans who want to help each other and themselves should be respected, is grounded in the experience of local organizations and community groups, and harnesses the initiative and genius of local institutions in an empowerment strategy that can work.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>

<p><li><b>The bill would reduce urban unemployment by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in inner-city areas.</b> This type of economic policy can reduce unemployment in affected localities by a third or more.

<p><li><b>The bill would expand educational opportunity by providing poor parents with scholarships which could be used to pay for tuition in private schools.</b> By giving poor parents the same sort of choice in education that middle-class families already have, the bill would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education, and reduce the rate of school failure.

<p><li><b>The bill would help churches and religious institutions rebuild the moral foundations of inner cities by allowing poor parents to enroll their children in religious schools.</b> The authors of the bill recognize the simple and uncomplicated truth that the development of a strong moral character, reinforced by religious discipline and the habitual practice of virtue, is the necessary basis for success in school, in work, and in life itself. The church, as an institution, is society's most effective weapon in saving children from alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, violent crime, sexual promiscuity, illegitimacy, and dependence. By allowing inner-city churches, through a school choice program, to play a far greater and more decisive role in shaping the hearts and minds of America's young people, the Saving Our Children bill would be a large step forward in combating the social ills that plague America's inner cities.

<p><li><b>The bill would further encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social service programs to help the poor.</b> It would expand the role of private-sector charity in aiding the poor. Federal, state, and local governments spend nearly $400 billion each year on a wide variety of programs to aid low-income Americans. By a wide margin, the public regards many, if not most, of these government programs as failures. By providing a generous tax credit for individual taxpayer donations to private charities which aid the poor, the Watts-Talent bill would enable the private sector, and religious charities in particular, to bring new and innovative local approaches to the struggle against poverty, drugs, family disintegration, and crime through programs that work and can make a real difference in the lives of young men and women.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comprehensive urban policy embodied in the Saving Our Children bill gives Congress an excellent opportunity to make a bipartisan stand for children. It rejects the premise that all that is needed for our nation's poorest communities are larger benefit checks from the government. It goes beyond simply managing the symptoms of impoverishment to tackle the root causes of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. It establishes the economic conditions which enable depressed communities to become more profitable places for work and business. And it recognizes and harnesses the positive energy of the nation's churches and religious institutions to advance the character and quality of American life.

<h2>The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dd>With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.  And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting the capital gains tax.  The Dole plan calls for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals from 28 percent to 14 percent.  
<p>
<dd>Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are high-risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half and you enhance the potential returns from risk-taking.
<p>
<dd>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<p>
<li> Across-the-board cut in personal income taxes.  A 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in three key ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument -- as the old saying goes, the less you tax something, the more of it you get.
<p>
<li> Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<p>
<li> Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being corporations), then an across-the-board personal income tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.  Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment, additional employees, et al. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Additional measures.  The Dole plan calls for other tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs, including: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> Unrestricted tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed.  MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health-care system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<p>
<li> Estate tax reductions.  The estate tax amount to nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.  All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path to complete repeal of the estate tax.
<p>
<li> Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.  Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources in the private sector.
<li> Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs.  Such measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds available to business.
<p>
<li> Regulatory reform.  Requiring peer-reviewed, science-based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some much-needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li>Legal reform.  Measures such as limiting punitive damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability for non-economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy countless businesses and the jobs they create.
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
<dd>U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief, and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would: 
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.
<p>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats (assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods -- faster growth means more goods and services.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Another Case of Envy Run Amok</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Envy always makes for dismal economics and bad tax policy.  We've
made this point time and again at the Small Business Survival
Foundation (for example, see &quot;The Great Tax Debate: Making
Sense of Competing Tax Plans by Raymond J. Keating, June 1995).
 Unfortunately, most of today's U.S. tax system can only be justified
on the basis of envy &#173;&#173; sound economics plays no part
at all.
<P>
The income tax, for example, diminishes incentives for working,
saving, investing, and risk taking, while at the same time, is
inefficient and intrusive.  The current U.S. income tax came into
existence in 1913.  It may have seemed fairly innocuous at first.
 Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the lowest rate
not taking effect until a married couple's income hit $60,000
(in inflation&#173;adjusted 1995 dollars, that is) and the top
rate not kicking in until income topped $7.4 million (again, in
1995 dollars).  In subsequent years, as we all know, income tax
rates skyrocketed, reaching ever deeper into the pockets of all
working Americans, not just the wealthy.  And for the most part,
government squandered these resources.
<P>
Following quickly on the heals of the income tax was the estate
tax, imposed in 1916.  This was another envy&#173;driven levy.
 When first imposed, the estate tax was targeted at the rich,
with rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent.  Today, the estate
tax takes hold at a lower threshold, with far more severe tax
rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent (even 60 percent
for certain estates).  That is, since the estate tax's inception,
the lowest rate has jumped by 1,700 percent and the top rate by
more than 205 percent.  In addition, the highest tax rate would
have taken hold at an estate valued at almost $70 million under
the original estate tax structure, versus today's, with the top
rate kicking in at just over $3 million.
<P>
Efforts to cut the estate tax are worthy.  However, since no sound
economics basis exists for such a tax, and since the estate tax
serves as a major destroyer of family businesses and jobs, the
most productive step would be to eliminate the estate tax.  
<P>
Envy must give way to economics in order for entrepreneurship
and the economy to flourish.<BR>

<h2>Charity and Responsibility</h2>
<p>
<h3>CRC Hosts Washington Conference</h3>
<p>
<p>
<DD>On June 25, Capital Research Center hosted a 
conference on the theme of &quot;Charity and Responsibility.&quot;  Some 
100 guests from private and family foundations, 
corporations, think tanks, and the media gathered at the University 
Club in Washington, D.C. to discuss the prospects for 
strengthening private charity and reforming the welfare state.
<DD>Capital Research Center president <B>Terrence 
Scanlon</B> opened the event by remarking that &quot;our country 
cannot have a prosperous and free economy and a 
responsible government unless we have strong and independent 
social institutions.&quot;  He criticized the way that many 
tax-exempt organizations in recent years have undermined the 
American tradition of charity and responsibility by 
promoting governmentrather than private and 
voluntaryapproaches to public problems: &quot;Rather than provide a 
valuable public service that government cannot or should 
not provide, many nonprofits mobilize activists and lobby 
for higher taxes, more regulation, and more welfare 
programsthe same programs that have repeatedly failed our 
neediest citizens.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The View from Capitol Hill</H4>
<DD>The morning keynote speakers were 
Representatives <B>David M. McIntosh</B> (R-IN) and 
<B>Ernest J. Istook</B> (R-OK), sponsors of last year's &quot;Istook Amendment,&quot; a measure which would have limited taxpayer funding of 
nonprofit organizations that engage in political advocacy.
<DD>Rep. McIntosh criticized the welfare state for 
undermining America's tradition of community-based 
problem-solving.  He also endorsed the idea of a tax credit for 
charitable giving.  This would allow individual taxpayers to 
directly earmark a portion of their federal tax dollars to 
charities that help the needy while requiring dollar-for-dollar cuts 
in government welfare programs.
<DD>Noting that &quot;charity begins at home, not in the 
Capitol building,&quot; Rep. Istook called for greater exposure of 
nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer support 
while lobbying for more welfare programs.  He argued 
that Congress and the media must educate the public about 
the role of advocacy groups so that voters will demand 
passage of legislation such as the failed Istook Amendment: 
&quot;The invisibility of many advocacy groups makes it difficult 
to build public support for reform.  The public tends to 
think all nonprofits are good, but many nonprofits are 
essentially lobbying arms of the government.&quot;<BR>
<H4>The Media's perspective</H4>
<P>Former Attorney General <B>Edwin Meese III</B> chaired 
a lively panel on the media's coverage of philanthropy.  
Five speakers who have written extensively on nonprofit 
organizations from a variety of perspectives argued about 
changes in the nonprofit sector and their impact on the kinds 
of stories they write.  Panelists generally agreed that the 
media pays ample attention to &quot;horror stories&quot; in 
philanthropy, such as the recent United Way scandal, but that the 
day-to-day work of charities and grantmakers goes largely 
unreported.
<DD><B>Jody Curtis</B>, executive editor of the <B>Council on 
Foundations</B>' <I>Foundation News + 
Commentary</I>, said that her publication has focused on offering &quot;how-to&quot; advice to donors and has generally avoided controversial issues 
in philanthropy.  Future editions, however, might 
explore more contentious subjects, such as direct-service 
giving versus advocacy or highlight examples of failure in 
philanthropy<BR>
<DD><B>Roberta d'Eustachio</B>, president and founder of 
the soon-to-be-launched <I>American Benefactor 
Magazine</I>, contended that wealthy individuals need entertaining and 
easy-to-understand articles that will encourage them to 
become donors and create foundations.  She emphasized that 
benefactors sometimes need help in clarifying their 
philanthropic values but cautioned those who advise them to 
&quot;let 1,000 flowers bloom&quot; and not try to choose donors' causes.
<DD><B>Laurence Jarvik</B>, editor of CRC's newsletters 
<I>Foundation Watch</I> and <I>Culture Watch</I>, contended that a 
&quot;1960s sensibility permeates most large foundations,&quot; making 
them reluctant to reconsider long-standing grants programs aimed at 
expanding the welfare state.  Unless the media begins to subject the nonprofit sector 
to greater scrutiny and criticism, he contended, major foundations will 
not change their ways.
<DD><B>Adam Meyerson</B>, editor of the <B>Heritage 
Foundation</B>'s <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American 
Citizenship</I>, contended that the mainstream 
foundation world is wedded to the welfare state 
and is dominated by ideas that don't work.  Fortunately, he said, there are 
many small, community-based organizations that are successfully addressing 
problems such as crime, failing public schools, and family breakdown.  If 
journalists tell the story of these groups, they can serve as models for 
broader privately based initiatives.  (Meyerson's presentation appears on page five.)
<DD><B>Vince Stehle</B>, assistant editor of <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
opined that recent media scrutiny has helped make the nonprofit sector more professional and efficient. During the question-and-answer period, Meyerson 
observed that unlike private businesses, nonprofits do 
not have to satisfy customers to stay in business and, 
unlike government, they do not have to heed the will of voters. </I>Nonprofit accountability, he contended, requires close 
scrutiny by donors, the media, and watchdog groups.  
<B>Joseph Dolan</B> of the <B>Achelis and Bodman 
Foundations</B> suggested that evaluation of the effectiveness of nonprofit 
programs will become increasingly important as the needy come 
to rely on private programs rather than government welfare.
<P>
<P><H4>Replacing the Welfare State</H4>
<DD>A second panel, following lunch, explained why it's time for private 
initiative to replace failed government programs.  Chaired by 
<B>Daniel J. Popeo</B>, chairman and general counsel of 
the <B>Washington Legal Foundation</B>, it featured three leaders from private 
foundations.
<DD><B>Michael Cawley</B>, president of the <B>Samuel Roberts Noble 
Foundation</B> of Ardmore, Oklahoma, argued that 
the welfare state has &quot;stunted our desire to be charitable.&quot;  Nonetheless, he 
noted how Americans have time and again responded generously in the wake 
of natural disasters and tragedies such as the Oklahoma City bombing.  He 
expressed optimism that the genuinely needy would receive adequate 
assistance as government welfare is scaled back.
<DD><B>Heather Higgins</B>, director of the <B>Randolph 
Foundation</B>, contended that the welfare state's universal 
guarantee of benefits has undermined the desire of many recipients 
to change self-destructive behaviors.  The goal of 
charities, she said, &quot;should not be to replace government welfare 
but to do better than government programs.&quot;  She 
suggested that the media celebrate &quot;heroes&quot; in 
philanthropygrassroots organizers who are successfully addressing 
social problems through private initiativeso that 
average Americans can see that their efforts will make a difference.
<HR>
<BR>
<I>Heather Higgins: The goal of charities &quot;should not be to replace 
government welfare but to do better than government programs.&quot;</I><BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<B>James Piereson</B>, president of the <B>John M. Olin 
Foundation</B>, conjectured that we are in the early stages of 
major change in the philanthropic sector.  He urged supporters 
of a free society to develop a richer philosophy that 
encourages more voluntarism and a sense of moral obligation 
to others.  Arguing that lower taxes are essential to increased charitable giving, he expressed reservations about a 
charity tax credit, saying that it would undermine prospects for 
a lower, flat tax.  (Piereson's presentation appears on 
page four.) 
<BR>
<H3>Counsel for Charitable Giving</H3>
<DD>Also speaking at Capital Research Center's 
&quot;Charity and Responsibility&quot; conference were Daniel J. 
Popeo, chairman and general counsel of the Washington 
Legal Foundation (WLF) and a CRC trustee, and William 
J. Lehrfeld, a private attorney.  They announced 
the creation of the Counsel for Charitable Giving, 
whose aim is to provide technical assistance to 
individuals, families, and companies wishing to create 
charitable foundations to promote the cause of free enterprise 
and limited government.  For more information, call

<H4>Alternatives in Philanthropy</H4><BR>
Fashioning a Conservative Alternative to Welfare<BR>
by Dr. James E. Piereson<BR>
Executive Director<BR>
 The John M. Olin Foundation
<P>
<DD>What is the conservative alternative to the welfare state? 
 If welfare were ended, how would we help the poor, the 
sick and disabled, and the elderly who now depend upon 
welfare programs?
<DD>These questions are often posed to those of us who 
reject the policies, institutions, and ideological assumptions 
of the welfare state.  Unfortunately, they do not admit of 
easy answers.  The fact that the welfare state has entangled 
itself in the lives of countless families and communities makes 
it all the more difficult to end without painful disruptions.
<DD>Some conservatives argue that we need a new 
public philosophy to challenge the world view of the welfare state. 
 This would emphasize duties as well as rights, the 
community as well as the individual, and private charity rather 
than government programs as the best means of 
addressing social problems.  Speaker Newt Gingrich has emphasized 
a &quot;conservative opportunity society,&quot; in which 
privately funded institutions assist the needy.  Others, borrowing 
the terminology of Eastern European reformers, stress 
rebuilding the institutions of &quot;civil society,&quot; which have 
been weakened by decades of reliance on government.  In 
both conceptions, private philanthropy is given the 
important task of bringing into place viable alternatives to 
welfare programs.
<DD>It is sometimes said that private institutions can 
better serve the poor and needy than the national government 
with <HR>
<BR>
&quot;We are in the relatively early stages of an important 
reform movement that has a long time yet to run its course.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
its array of welfare programs.  As a general proposition, 
I believe this is true.  Certainly, as Marvin Olasky has 
shown, it was true historically in America from colonial days to 
the Great Depression.
<DD>Yet the poverty problem, driven by misguided 
welfare policy, has exploded to a scale that will be very difficult 
for private institutions to manage.  It will be more effective 
to reform the welfare state in ways that begin to scale back 
the problem, rather than try to turn the task wholly over 
to private institutions.  Perhaps both can be done, but 
welfare reform appears to be a necessary condition for any success.
<DD>Is philanthropy being asked to do too much?  I suspect 
it is, especially when we consider the limited resources on 
our side.  Currently, the federal government spends 
some $400,000,000,000 annually on poverty programs, 
including AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, rent supplements, and the like.  In 1995, individuals, foundations, and corporations donated some $144,000,000,000 to charitable 
institutions of various kinds.  My sense is that private 
philanthropyespecially conservative philanthropyis not 
yet substantial enough to carry out the assignment some 
have given it.
<DD>Still, I believe we are in the relatively early stages of 
an important reform movement that has a long time yet to
<HR>
<BR>
&quot;I have some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole and others, because I fear it would 
undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.&quot;<HR>
<BR>
 
run its course.  We should remember that liberal 
philanthropy developed at the turn of the century in tandem with 
the Progressive movement.  It was built on the idea then 
in fashion that experts could identify social problems 
and design appropriate solutions that government would 
implement.  The cultural revolution of the 1960s drove 
liberal foundations ever deeper into this morass as new 
constituent groups were identified as clients of the welfare state.  
If conservatives are to reverse this trend, they will need 
to develop their own persuasive ideas.  This is now 
beginning to happen through the work of people like Marvin 
Olasky, Arianna Huffington, and groups like the 
Philanthropy Roundtable and the Capital Research Center.
<DD>I have given something of a mixed answer to the 
question posed earlier about philanthropy and the dismantling of 
the welfare state.  Bearing in mind Harry Truman's comment about the one-armed economist, let me lay down a 
few simple principles so that I do not end on a mixed note.  
It seems that several things should be done in tandem and 
in combination:
<UL>
<LI>First, public policy must be reformed, particularly 
in the areas of welfare and taxes, in order to scale back the 
size of the poverty problem and to encourage donations 
to charitable organizations.  Lower tax rates and reform 
of estate taxes would allow Americans to pass along 
more wealth to charities and to their families.  I have 
some reservations about an earmarked charitable deduction, 
as proposed by Senator Dole (R-KS) and others, because 
I fear it would undermine efforts to achieve a low flat tax.
<LI>Second, a conservative vision of philanthropy, 
linked to our understanding of a free society, must be advanced 
to challenge the reigning liberal philanthropy of such 
institutions as the Council on Foundations and the 
Ford, Rockefeller, and Pew foundations.  Such a vision, if 
aggressively pressed, will begin to increase donations to 
conservative organizations.
<LI>Third, we need to show that private-sector approaches, realistically conceived and assessed, are more effective than government programs in moving people 
out of poverty and into mainstream American life.  
Fortunately, many such models exist, but they need to be expanded 
and brought to the public's attention.
</UL>
<DD>With so much to do, there is no need for donors to fall 
into line behind one or another particular approach.  We are far better 
off if we encourage a healthy diversity that leaves room for donors to 
express their own interests in philanthropy.
<DD>The John M. Olin Foundation, for example, following the lead 
of our late donor, emphasizes public-policy studies in the areas of 
taxation, regulation, welfare, and national security, among others.  
Our general objective is to support individuals and institutions that work 
to strengthen our system of free enterprise and limited government.  
Most of our funds are directed to academic programs and research 
centers that support scholars, students, and researchers who address 
these issues.
<DD>Other donors, however, will want to emphasize 
different approaches.  Some will want to focus on direct assistance 
to the needy in their communities.  Others may want to 
support programs in the arts, education, history, literature, 
and philosophy.  This is all good and a sign of healthy 
growth in a movement just beginning to find its stride.
<DD>But let us not forget our larger goal, which is not 
to promote philanthropy for its own sake, but to strive 
to create for our children and grandchildren a country 
with more prosperity, more freedom, and greater moral 
confidence than the one we inherited.<BR>

<H4>The Trouble with Philanthropy</H4>
<BR>
by Adam Meyerson<BR>
Editor<BR>
<I>Policy Review</B></I>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>I come to you with the sad message that 
mainstream philanthropy is part of the problem in this country, not 
part of the solution.  There are many fine people in the 
mainstream foundations, and they fund many fine programs.  
But the foundation world has been dominatedand is 
still dominatedby ideas that do not work.
<DD>For the past 30 years, one of the central objectives 
of foundations has been to open opportunity for black 
Americans.  That is a noble, marvelous objective.  But what 
do foundations have to show for their efforts?  More black 
men are in jail or prison today than in college.
<DD>A second objective of foundations has been to 
revitalize cities and their economies.  Again, a noble objective.  
But New York City is bankrupt.  Washington, D.C. is bankrupt. 
 Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, 
Baltimore, and St. Louis have seen population declines of 25 
to 30 percent.
<DD>For 30 years, mainstream philanthropy has 
supposedly been standing up for children.  But more children 
are growing up in poverty today than 30 years ago.  We have 
an epidemic of child abuse.  Half a million children 
are languishing in state foster care.  And we've seen the 
collapse of the best safety net a child can havea mom and 
a dad who love him or her so much that they are willing to 
stay together despite marital difficulties.
<P>I submit that mainstream philanthropy has failed in 
all these areas because it has had the wrong ideas.  What 
are these ideas?  Here are eight of them:
<UL>
<LI>The failure to understand the importance of 
stable, two-parent families.  Philanthropy's focus has been 
on food, medical care, and income maintenance for the 
children of broken homes.  These are important, but it's 
more important to bring husbands and wives back together.
<LI>An overconcern with funding levels for schools 
and health and welfare programs and too little concern 
with performance levels.
<LI>Opposition to desperately needed reforms of 
the public-school system, such as the introduction of vouchers.
<LI>A bean-counting obsession with &quot;diversity,&quot; 
which has led public schools to set tragically low expectations 
for poor children, especially minorities.  The best 
affirmative action offers equal opportunity to all while holding 
everyone to the same high standards.
<LI>nThe perception of criminals as victims rather than victimizers.  This has undermined true rehabilitation, 
which must begin with repentance for committing evil.
<LI>A reluctance to say that certain kinds of 
behavior, such as teenage sex, abortion, promiscuity, or 
long-term welfare dependency, are morally wrong.
<LI>A misguided economic strategy, based on a 
misunderstanding of capitalism and wealth creation.  This has 
led to a disregard for the way that poor Americans are 
ravaged by high taxes, regulation, and crime.
<LI>A preoccupation with using the federal 
government to solve all our problems.  The great tragedy of 
government today is that it tries to do so much that it doesn't do 
anything well.
</UL>
<DD>The good news is that a tidal wave of social 
entrepreneurship is sweeping the country.  Ordinary Americans, 
through grassroots organizing, are solving problems that have 
perplexed mainstream foundations.  They're putting 
marriages back together, cutting crime, improving schools, and 
offering economic opportunity to the poor.  You can read 
their stories in our magazine, <I>Policy Review: The Journal 
of American Citizenship</I>.

<P>
If not dishonest, Washington's traditional misuse of numbers certainly is misleading. 
The use of a technical device known as "baseline budgeting" has enabled policy-makers 
for 20 years to claim spending reductions while increasing spending. Everything, 
it seems - from omnibus spending bills to the budget reconciliation process 
- has been intended to hide from the public the true cost of Washington's actions. 
Just what does a $260 billion tax increase mean to the average family or the 
typical community?
<P>


The Heritage Foundation can now provide the answers. Thanks to a major half-million-dollar 
technical upgrade of our computer-analysis capabilities, Heritage's Roe Institute 
for Economic Policy Studies can now provide - overnight, if necessary - the 
kind of "hard numbers" and statistical analysis that can change the course 
of debate. Over and over again in 1994 - on the crime bill, on the flood of 
health-care reform plans that threatened to overwhelm Capitol Hill, on the 
fiscal year 1995 budget - Heritage showed that its data-analysis capabilities 
now rival those of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management 
and Budget. But that's not all; as often as possible, Heritage analysts attempted 
to make the numbers understandable, showing how various policy proposals would 
impact individual businesses, workers, families, and the cities and states 
where they live.

Endowed by The Roe Foundation of Greenville, S.C., and other supporters, the 
Roe Institute staff specializes in budget and tax issues, the effects of regulation 
on the economy, environmental policy, competitiveness, and trade. Recommendations 
in 1994 included a call for a $500-per-child tax credit, repeal of the Social 
Security earnings tax, and reduction and indexation of the capital gains tax. 
The Roe Institute staff also identified numerous wasteful and inefficient government 
programs that should be cut back or eliminated and helped convince lawmakers 
of the merits of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And, of 
course, they continued to argue persuasively for a balanced budget amendment 
to the Constitution, which became a major component of the House GOP's "Contract 
with America."

Heritage's popular prosperity plan for America, called "Putting Families First," 
served as the basis for the alternative budget offered by House and Senate 
Republicans in 1994. While the plan, written by <a href="/heritage/s
taff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Heritage's Grover 
M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, fell short in the 103rd Congress, 
most of its components were included in the "Contract with America."  
<P>



<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>egulatory <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eform</H3></CENTER>

Roe Institute analysts also focused in 1994 on the regulatory burden placed 
on the economy, environmental policies that threaten private-property rights, 
and "unfunded mandates" - regulations the federal government imposes on businesses 
and state and local governments without paying for them. Among the most widely 
quoted studies published during the year was then Deputy Director Susan Eckerly's 
first-ever "Citizen's Guide to Regulation," which illustrated the real damage 
overzealous federal bureaucrats can do to the economy, businesses, and individuals.

The expertise built up over five years of intensive research, aided by new 
data-processing capabilities, enabled Heritage's health-policy experts, headed 
by <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart
Butler</a>, Vice President and Director, Domestic Policy Studies, and 
Deputy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a>, to play a significant role in the defeat of 
government-controlled health care in 1994. After providing Congress and the 
media with a wealth of material showing why the Clinton health-care plan would 
be a disaster, the Heritage analysts produced more than a dozen papers during 
a three-week summer period analyzing in detail the many alternative plans that 
flooded the marketplace after the collapse of the Clinton plan. The result: 
Any hope of placing one-seventh of the U.S. economy under the control of the 
federal government vanished.
<P>
Meanwhile, Heritage continued to argue that the best way to reform health care 
is to de-link health insurance from the workplace so individuals can own their 
own health policies and have a direct stake in their cost. This idea was the 
model for the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, sponsored in the 103rd Congress 
by Sen. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL).

Even as Heritage Welfare and Family Issues Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> was exposing 
President Clinton's welfare-reform plan as another expansion of the welfare 
state, Cultural Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> was helping focus the nation's 
attention on the connection between the startling rise in illegitimate births 
and other social pathologies, such as crime and failure in school. In both 
the House and Senate, 1994 saw the introduction of legislation based on Rector's 
research and recommendations. Many of these same ideas - such as banning increased 
benefits for unwed mothers under age 21 who have additional children, requiring 
welfare recipients to work for their benefits, and putting an overall cap on 
welfare spending - were included in the House GOP's "Contract with America."

Also in 1994, Heritage Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>'s "Index of Leading Cultural Indicators" was updated, expanded, and 
published as a quality paperback by Touchstone Books, a division of Simon and 
Schuster. Americans now have at their fingertips the information they need 
to monitor long-term trends in America's social health. Bennett's "The Book 
of Virtues," meanwhile, remained on The New York Times bestseller list throughout 
the year.

"The Heritage Foundation is without question the most far-reaching conservative 
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous 
impact not just in Washington but literally across the planet." - House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, R-GA.
<p>

<p>

When more than 300 Republican congressional candidates joined House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the steps of the Capitol for a Sept. 27 "photo 
op" - intended to focus national attention on the House GOP's "Contract with 
America" - liberal "spin doctors" warned that Gingrich & Company had gravely 
miscalculated.  Weeks later the voters delivered their own verdict: It was 
the spin doctors who had miscalculated.
<P>
The "Contract with America" drew heavily from years of Heritage Foundation 
research.  While not every detail of every proposal was identical to the recommendations 
made over the years by Heritage analysts in their congressional testimony, 
articles, books, and research papers, the similarities were striking.  Said 
the liberal Boston Globe: "As the leading source of scholarship for that [conservative] 
movement, The Heritage Foundation has been able to hammer home a simple message: 
Government programs have done more to worsen the nation's social problems than 
to heal them."          
<P>
Heritage welcomed the 1994 political season with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," a first-of-its-kind 
candidates' briefing book providing comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform. Newt 
Gingrich, who would become the new Speaker of the House in 1995, called the 
book, which was made available to every House and Senate candidate (and, on 
request, several gubernatorial candidates), an example of Heritage at its best: 
doing "serious work ... and thinking about not just how to get power, but how 
to use power for the nation's good." In the final weeks of the fall campaign, 
talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh read extensive excerpts from "Issues '94," which 
had become a primary reference source for dozens of campaigns. Many of these 
campaigns were successful. 
<P>

<P>

Following the conservative victory in November, Heritage was ready once again 
with a policy blueprint for the new 104th Congress. The 19-chapter "New Member's 
Guide to the Issues" - compared by some to Heritage's Reagan-era "Mandate for 
Leadership" series - offered concrete suggestions for a conservative reordering 
of Washington on issues as diverse as agriculture, the budget, crime, defense 
policy, education, regulation, taxation, and trade. The Guide served as the 
basic "textbook" at Heritage's freshman orientation program for new members 
of Congress, held in December in Baltimore. 
<P>


"Issues '94" and "The New Member's Guide to the Issues" were both collaborative 
efforts involving The Heritage Foundation's entire research staff.

Program</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>Clinton and Cisneros Wrecked a Good Housing Program</h3>
<i>November 1, 1995</i><P>

Letter to the Editor of <i>The Washington Times</i> 
</center> 
<hr> 
Dear Editor: 
<P> 
I was surprised to learn that, according to your Oct. 26 report ("HUD's 
relocation of urban poor targeted for ax," Nation), I had "launched" the 
Clinton administrations' Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Moving to 
Opportunity program to "address urban blight by moving poor people from 
public housing in inner cities to subsidized rental units in higher-income 
neighborhoods."
<P> 
In the Bush administration, the Moving to Opportunity program was first 
authorized Oct. 28, 1992,--two weeks before President Clinton's election 
victory.  The program was designed as a demonstration project to support a 
family's choice to use a rental voucher to move to privately owned housing in 
any neighborhood of the family's choosing--one that offered more job 
opportunities for parents and better education for children.  This was the 
essence of the Reagan idea of vouchers for housing instead of public housing 
construction.  As such, the program was the antithesis of the social 
engineering that resulted in the forced residency of low-income families in 
government-run housing projects in the inner city. 
<P>Unfortunately, by the time Moving to Opportunity was 
<i>launched</i> by the Clinton administration in 1994 (see "A helping hand 
or social engineering?" Nation, March, 15, 1994), the program had been 
transformed by HUD into a massive new fair-housing program to disperse 
low-income families to middle-income suburban neighborhoods.  HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros said he wanted to replicate this dispersal strategy in 
every city in the country.
<P> 
The Clinton/Cisneros plan distorted a program that was intended to 
support the housing vouchers--the cornerstone of conservative housing policy.  
That's unfortunate, but under the circumstances, Congress was right to end it.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Not Worth All the Trouble</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<P>
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<P>
<P>
Benjamin Franklin pointed out that &quot;in this world nothing
is certain but death and taxes.&quot;  However, dying and taxing
used to be two separate events &#173;&#173; both generally faced
with trepidation.  Leave it to government to bring these two anxious
moments together in one levy &#173;&#173; the estate tax.
<P>
Of course, the estate tax inflicts great harm on family businesses.
 This government hostile takeover &#173;&#173; estate tax rates
range from 18 percent to 55 percent, reaching 60 percent for some
estates &#173;&#173; at the time of an owner's death can be too
much to overcome.  Indeed, as pointed out last year by Investor's
Business Daily (April 12, 1995), 60 percent of family businesses
fail to survive to the second generation, and 90 percent do not
make it to the third.  The estate tax acts as a leading cause
of family business deaths.  In addition, this enormous tax on
business assets offers little incentive for an owner to continue
investing in and expanding his business as he grows older.  
<P>
To say the least, the estate tax acts as a burden on the economy.
 However, the so&#173;called pay&#173;off for the government is
nominal at best.  As noted in the accompanying chart, real revenues
from federal death taxes have not grown much since 1975.  In fact,
1995 estate and gift tax revenues were actually less than their
1977 level.  On a per capita basis, inflation&#173;adjusted estate
tax revenues were down by one&#173;third between 1977 and 1995.
 In addition, estate tax revenues amounted to just over 1 percent
of total federal revenues in 1995.  Factor in compliance and litigation
efforts relating to the estate tax, and the federal government's
take drops much further (some estimate that as much as 75 percent
of estate taxes are eaten up by such costs).  Add in lost businesses,
jobs, and output, and the estate tax becomes a net loser in terms
of federal revenues.
<P>
When weighing the federal government's net revenues from the estate
tax against the considerable economic damage wrought by this levy,
 the case for eliminating the estate tax becomes crystal clear.

<h2>Coporate Philanthropy: A Reexamination</h2>
<hr>

<I>Corporations and corporate foundations gave an estimated $6.11 billion to nonprofit organizations in 1994. 
 This represented 4.7 percent of total charitable giving ($129.88 billion).  Of this $6.11 billion, the 
largest corporations gave at least $35.78 million to public-affairs organizationsgroups that seek to influence 
public policy in such areas as the environment, taxes, and regulation.
<P>While $35.78 million is a relatively minor amount, public-affairs groups operating with small budgets 
have successfully lobbied government to reallocate billions of dollars in private-sector resources.  This is a 
central contention of Capital Research Center's 
</I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy<I>, an annual study of 
corporate public-affairs giving.  CRC research associate 
<B>Austin Fulk</B> summarizes findings from this year's 
tenth anniversary edition, which examines corporate giving in 1994.
<P>This issue also features an essay on corporate giving by 
<B>William E. Simon</B>, a CRC trustee and president 
of the John M. Olin Foundation who served as Secretary of the Treasury to Presidents Nixon and Ford.
<P>Six observers of corporate philanthropy respond: 
<B>Kristen A. Avansino</B>, President of the E.L. 
Wiegand Foundation; <B>Albert Dunlap</B>, Chairman of Sunbeam Corporation; economist 
<B>Milton Friedman</B>; <B>Heather R. Higgins</B>, Director of the Randolph Foundation; 
<B>Henry Manne</B>, Professor of Law at George Mason 
University; and <B>Dorothy S. Ridings</B>, President of the Council on Foundations.
<P>Finally, CRC Visiting Fellow <B>Martin Morse 
Wooster</B> reviews <B>John Hood</B>'s new book,

<B>Taking Philanthropy Seriously:
<P>Giving as Though Our Future
<P>Depended on It
<P>by William E. Simon</B>
<P>
<P>It is a sad commentary, but I see many American 
business leaders financing the destruction of freedom.  They 
have been doing so for decades.  I don't mean that they 
give enormous amounts of money to political candidates 
who regularly vote against the interests of a competitive 
free economy (they do, but that is another matter).
<P>I am referring to their support of nonprofit 
organizations that are controlled by what Irving Kristol has called 
the &quot;new class.&quot;  This elite, hostile to the fundamental 
principles of our society, happily devours the fruits of 
capitalism while working to poison the tree that bears them.

<B>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy,
<P>Tenth Edition:
<P>Funding the Clinton Agenda
<P>by Austin Fulk</B>
<P>
<P>1994 marked a pivotal point in the history of 
American politics.  After two years of the Clinton presidency and 
forty years of Democratic control of the House of 
Representatives, voters turned out to elect Republican majorities 
in both Houses of Congress.
<P>Anger at Clinton Administration plans to expand the 
size of government fueled voter upheaval: a failed attempt 
to nationalize the health-care system, tax increases despite 
a Clinton campaign promise for &quot;middle-class tax cuts,&quot; 
and continued assaults on private property rights 
alienated many voters and led to the Democrats' reversal of fortune.

be viewed as &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;socially responsible,&quot; no matter to what asinine end 
this leads them.  They are in mortal terror of being 
branded &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;rapacious&quot; or &quot;insensitive&quot; or 
&quot;exploiters&quot; and of losing their seats at the annual dinners 
of organizations dedicated to their destruction.
<P>
<P><B>The Entrepreneurial Spirit</B>
<P>This was not the attitude of the great entrepreneurs 
who built American enterprise.  Andrew Carnegie did not 
yearn to be the guest of honor at a dinner of the Industrial 
Workers of the World.  He had faith in the system of 
private enterprise and worked to produce, as cheaply as 
possible, the steel to build the railroads, bridges, and skyscrapers 
of a rising America.
<P>John D. Rockefeller wanted to make transportat<BR>
&quot;Business leaders . . . have provided much of the driving energy of 
the anti-capitalist movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding 
the struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.&quot;<BR>
ion and illumination available to every family.  Henry Ford 
wanted to give millions of Americans a chance at low-cost 
transportation.  Jim Hill envisioned a northern empire across 
the great plains, built a great railroad without 
government subsidies, and brought settlers to produce wheat 
for America's bread.
<P>These were tough-minded men, and some of the 
things they did invited legitimate criticism; but they never 
wavered in their faith that freedom of enterprise would 
build a great and powerful and prosperous America.
<P>By contrast, a distressing number of today's 
non-owning managers of industry act like bureaucrats in 
three-piece suits whose goal is to get along without making waves.  
If Carnegie had had that mentality, he would have retired 
as the chief telegrapher of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
and somebody elseI hopewould have forged the rails 
to cross our prairies and made the steel plate for our 
Great White Fleet.
<P>Business leaders who lack commitment to the virtues 
of our system are almost as guilty as those whose goal is 
to destroy that system.  They urge business to keep a 
&quot;low profile&quot; and scoff at the free-market ideal as an 
obsolete notion in this modern age.  They have an obsession 
with being accepted and toasted by the most vocal of 
their <BR>
<B>Fueling the War on Freedom</B>
<P>The keenest and most prophetic analysis of this 
problem was offered half a century ago by Joseph Schumpeter in 
his landmark work <I>Capitalism, Socialism, and 
Democracy</I>.  It was he who first pointed out that capitalism, by its 
very success in raising the standard of living to 
unprecedented heights, would weaken the institutions necessary for 
its survival, giving way to a centralized socialist 
bureaucracy that would exploit the productive capacity created by 
private enterprise.
<P>Schumpeter gloomily concluded that the leaders of 
capitalism would likely absorb the slogans of radicalism and 
let themselves be converted &quot;to a creed hostile to [their] 
very existence&quot; because they were &quot;rapidly losing faith in 
[their] own creed.&quot;  &quot;This is verified,&quot; he wrote, &quot;by the 
characteristic manner in which particular capitalist interests 
and bourgeoisie as a whole behave when facing direct attack. 
 They talk and plead or hire people to do it for them.  
They snatch at every chance of compromise.  They are ever 
ready to give in.  They never put up a fight under the flag of 
their own ideals and their interests.&quot;
<P>There are, in my view, several different reasons 
why business leaders act this way.  One is simply lack 
of awareness.  They are too busy running their businesses 
to know what is going on in the intellectual world about 
them, unless their companies are specifically attacked.  
Such ignorance can well be economically fatal.
<P>Others, while perhaps aware of the drumbeat of 
attacks on capitalism, are simply unable to understand why 
those attacks are invalid.  Perhaps it sounds reasonable to them 
to believe that capitalism is some kind of scourge and 
affliction which has beset much of the world while ignoring 
the fact that people in non-Western countries yearn for 
the same chance at freedom and prosperity.
<P>Some may be aware of the merits of our system but 
have no inkling of how to fight back.  After all, they are 
in business, not in battles over public opinion, and they 
are usually less confident with the written word than is 
the intellectual class from which the attack springs.  So 
they flee the field of battle.
<P>Still others simply may not want to get involved.  
They simply assume that, somehow, the system of which they 
are a part will survive the attacks of its enemies without 
their participation.  Only when the attack hits home do they 
wake upand then it may be too late.  Edmund Burke's 
famous maxim is particularly apt: &quot;All that is necessary for 
the forces of evil to win in the world is for good men to 
do nothing.&quot;
<P>The worst are those who yield before the assaults of 
their enemies.  They long to 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 3 -->

critics.
<P>Two decades ago, at the American Enterprise 
Institute, Robert Bork observed that &quot;These are the people thought 
of by the general public and by critics of the corporate 
system as bold, rapacious, cunning leaders, the Machiavellis of 
our society.&quot;  In reality, however, &quot;one finds many of them to 
be docile, apprehensive, defensive, and unsure of how 
to respond to sharp unrelenting attacks. . . .  It is as though 
a large fraction of the [business] community . . . wants 
to make preemptive concessions, as if they meet not to plan 
a fight against a wrongheaded movement but to discuss 
how best to negotiate the terms of surrender.&quot;
<P>Bork went on to concludeand it is a conclusion I 
very much sharethat business can never regain its moral 
legitimacy until business leaders can convince the rest of 
the country that they believe in that legitimacy themselves. 
 Their defensive posture &quot;will earn only the contempt of 
the enemies of corporations and capitalism, while leading 
the large, relatively indifferent majority to suppose that 
the <BR>
&quot;Every corporation should spend every dollar of every contribution 
with the same care it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the same level, and 
by many of the same people, as decisions about corporate strategy 
and investment.&quot;<BR>
essage.
<P>A second step is for business leaders themselves to 
play an active role on the boards of foundations that 
their businesses have made possible.  The most fatal of errors 
is for men and women who have proven themselves in 
the profit-making sector to accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back while professional foundation managers 
tell them the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.
<P>There are many able and conscientious foundation 
executives like Michael Joyce of the Bradley Foundation 
and Jim Piereson of Olin; but for every Joyce and 
Piereson, there seem to be dozens who practice the foundation 
equivalent of &quot;pack journalism&quot;managers who, with aims 
far different from those of their foundations' creators, make 
a career of trying to awe their directors with their 
superior wisdom and grander vision of the &quot;public interest.&quot;  
These people are very good at manipulating words and symbols 
so that the business director or trustee feels almost ashamed 
to <BR>
critics must be right: if capitalism were a positive good 
and worth defending, business leaders would not be so ready 
to compromise and, if need be, to capitulate.&quot;
<P>Alas, it is these same business leaders who have 
provided much of the driving energy of the anti-capitalist 
movement today.  They have done it not only by avoiding the 
struggle, but, worse yet, by financing their opponents.
<P>In 1995, American corporations gave out more than 
$7 billion in charitable contributions, much of it for 
very worthwhile charities like hospitals, the Red Cross, 
and religious institutions; but millions upon millions of 
dollars also are handed out to politically activist nonprofit 
organizations.  This money is lavished on groups whose 
actions show them to be contemptuous of democratic 
capitalism and enthusiastic about the squalor of collectivism.
<P>In 1977, the late Henry Ford II, grandson of the man 
who pioneered the low-cost car and the $5 daily wage, 
resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation, writing that 
&quot;The Foundation is a creature of capitalism&quot; but that &quot;it is 
hard to discern recognition of this fact in anything the 
Foundation does.  It is even more difficult to find an 
understanding of this in many of the institutions, particularly the 
universities, that are the beneficiaries of the Foundation's 
grant programs.&quot;  He urged his fellow trustees to &quot;examine 
the question of our obligations to our economic system and 
to consider how the foundation, as one of the system's 
most prominent offspring, might act most wisely to 
strengthen and improve its progenitor.&quot;  Asked why this had 
happened, he replied, &quot;I tried for thirty years to change it from 
within, to no avail.&quot;
<P>This is an all too familiar pattern in our largest 
foundations and corporations.  What a tragedy it would be 
if capitalism should prove to be the engine of its own 
destruction through its mindless support of those who would 
tear it down.
<P>
<P><B>What Can Be Done?</B>
<P>Fortunately, much can be done.  The first step is 
to awaken business leaders to the nature and magnitude of 
the threat and stiffen their backbones for the battle.
<P>There are many ways to do this, but there is no 
substitute for the determined leadership of those who are respected 
in the world of business.  My model here is the late John 
M. Olin, whose foundation I have the honor to head.  John 
Olin built a great industrial enterprise but never lost sight of 
the fundamentals of a free society.  When he endowed a 
foundation, he made it clear that its mission was to preserve 
our freedoms and strengthen our resolve in the unending 
battle we face.  When he spoke to businessmen, he 
unhesitatingly came down hard on the vital importance of preserving 
this system.  Others must come forward to repeat that m<BR>

Alternatives in Philanthropy<BR>
<B>Taking Philanthropy Seriously</B>
<P><I>(continued from page 3)</I><BR>
question the destination and use of grant money.
<P>Foundation trustees must, in a sense, become 
philosophical detectives, cutting through jargon and rhetoric to 
understand what is really being proposed.  Business 
people, whether they serve on foundation boards and 
corporate contributions committees or make contributions on 
their own, must take their obligations seriously.  They must 
learn to be as careful in their contributions as they are in 
their personal investments.
<P>Third, those of us who believe in the great principles 
of liberty upon which our society was founded must take 
pains to see that corporate and foundation gifts are directed to 
the support of institutions and individuals who are working 
to maintain freedom.  When I was Treasury Secretary, 
I offered this thought in a speech to corporate public 
affairs officers: Counsel your principals not to support 
organizations whose aim is to destroy our freedoms.  Unless 
corporations and business leaders steer their corporate gifts 
to institutions that are helping to maintain freedom, the 
largesse of the free enterprise system will continue to 
finance its own destruction.
<P>
<P><B>A Reaffirmation</B>
<P>The task of business is to ensure that voices are 
raised effectively from philanthropic institutions to support a 
free society.  The American people will always choose 
freedom once they understand the implications of the 
collectivist alternatives.
<P>Capitalism has no duty to subsidize its enemies.  It 
does have a duty to support the efforts of those individuals 
and institutions which cherish our freedoms and the values 
of Western civilization.  Every corporation should 
spend every dollar of every contribution with the same care 
it devotes to employee pay and new equipment.  
Decisions about corporate contributions should be made on the 
same level, and by many of the same people, as decisions 
about corporate strategy and investment.
<P>Corporations and foundations ought to apply 
zero-based budgeting to their contributions.  Instead of having 
an assistant treasurer just write the annual check, 
business leaders should look closely to see whether their 
donations are still serving a useful purpose or whether they could 
be put to better use elsewhere.
<P>Years ago, Joseph Schumpeter was asked whether 
his gloomy analysis of the impending decline of capitalism 
was defeatist.  He replied with some indignation, &quot;the 
report that a given ship is sinking is not defeatist, only the spirit 
in which this report is received can be defeatist.  The crew 
can sit down and drink.  But it can also rush to the pumps.&quot;<BR>
<B>Kristen A. Avansino
<P>President and Executive Director
<P>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<P>The business of nonprofits is the business of 
for-profits plus altruism.  More than ever, responsible giving 
and responsible disbursement are the bywords of 
exemplary philanthropy.  But today's philanthropic climate also 
demands that we repeat two caveats: Henry Ward 
Beecher warned donors, &quot;Do not give, as many rich men do, like 
a hen that lays an egg, and then cackles.&quot;  William Simon 
has warned trustees, &quot;Do not accept a foundation board seat 
and then sit back.&quot;
<P>Avansino: &quot;While a grant proposal may pull at a trustee's heartstrings,
<P>a sound business assessment is mandatory.&quot;<BR>
Management expert Peter Drucker reminds us that 
&quot;leadership is a foul-weather job.&quot;  The trustee who 
exercises real leadership must have a discerning mind and heart. 
 Every decision, however minuscule, embodies a 
fiduciary responsibility that transcends business as usual.  The 
trustee must understand the foundation's mission and have a 
profound respect for the donor whose wealth created 
the foundation.
<P>The trustee should assure that the financial 
mandates inherent in the for-profit world are also brought to bear 
on the foundation.  Questions regarding the foundation's 
fiscal health, management practices, efficiency, and 
effectiveness should be addressed, as should the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of 
the '90sduplication of services and accountability.  In 
short, while a grant proposal may pull at the trustee's 
heartstrings, a sound business assessment is mandatory.
<P>In the end, the business of nonprofit grant review 
should resemble business itself.  Philanthropy, the cornerstone 
of a civil society, demands no less.
<P>
<P><B>Albert Dunlap
<P>Chairman and CEO
<P>Sunbeam Corporation</B>
<P>
<P>Business is not a social experiment.  Far too 
many business leaders lose sight of what should be the goal 
of corporations in a capitalistic environmentlong-term 
profit optimization.  This objective creates and promotes 
the 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 5 -->

competitiveness which is essential for America to 
prosper in a global economy.
<P>One of the major underlying problems with 
corporate philanthropy is that most executives are self-serving 
and shortsighted.  Their actions, however, have long-term 
consequences for which they either do not care or do 
not understand.  They thirst for acceptance and 
recognition from the &quot;elite&quot; and fear criticism from the public.  
In today's environment, where the press is quick to attack 
and even sensationalize controversial views and decisions, 
most business leaders politicize their actions to avoid such 
criticism.
<P>If capitalism is to be protected and American business 
is to thrive, business leaders must be educated as to 
the completeness of their actions and their long-term effect 
on free enterprise.  They must then have the conviction to 
make decisions for the good of the whole, even if those 
who benefit resist due to their ignorance.  The price of 
leadership is criticism.
<P>
<P><B>Dr. Milton Friedman
<P>Senior Research Fellow
<P>Hoover Institution</B>
<P>
<P>As William Simon stresses, the social function of 
a business corporation is to produce goods and services 
that customers wish to buy, and to do so at the lowest 
possible cost.  Its function is not to serve as a philanthropic 
or charitable organization.  The only justification for 
philanthropy is tax avoidance: under present law, 
contributions up to a specified fraction of income are deductible 
in calculating income subject to tax, whereas dividend 
payments are not.  Accordingly, a one dollar reduction 
in dividends enables corporations to make a contribution 
of more than one dollar at the same cost.
<P>Friedman: &quot;I see little reason to expect the business community 
to change its current suicidal behavior with respect to philanthropy.&quot;<BR>
lative and rights can be created and changed.  
Importantly, too, since men are naturally good, evil can't 
come from them but rather wholly from the effects of evil 
social forces (e.g., poverty, capitalism, racism, and sexism).  
These forces must be countered by massive changes to 
society, essentially through the instrument of government.
<P>As a culture, we have largely succumbed to this 
second <BR>
The individual stockholder benefits if and only if 
the contributions are to causes or organizations that he or 
she wishes to support.  Except for closely held 
corporations with few stockholders, the way to assure that outcome 
is one Warren Buffet adopted many years ago for 
Berkshire-Hathaway.  Dividend checks to stockholders are 
accompanied by a statement along the following lines: &quot;In 
addition to paying a dividend, Berkshire-Hathaway will 
contribute X dollars per share of stock to charitable causes.  
Please return the enclosed form telling us whom you would 
like your share of those contributions to be given.&quot;
<P>Unfortunately, few corporations have followed that 
excellent example.  Short of their doing so or of tax 
changes that either permit the deductibility of dividends in 
calculating corporate taxes or deny the deductibility of 
charitable contributions, I see little reason to expect the 
business community to change its current suicidal behavior 
with respect to philanthropy.

<P><B>Heather R. Higgins
<P>Director
<P>The Randolph Foundation</B>
<P>
<P>From earliest childhood, I recall my frustrated 
father commenting in disgust that when it came to philanthropy 
or serving on boards, &quot;Businessmen park their brains at 
the door.&quot;  Sadly, experience repeatedly bears out this 
observation.
<P>Simon is correct in his analysis of the various factors 
that influence this behavior: preoccupation, ignorance, 
timidity, naivet&eacute;, and shallowness.  I would go even 
further, however, and argue that behind these characteristics lie 
a vast philosophical change which has affected most 
Americans, not just business leaders: a complete reorientation 
in the basic assumptions of who we are and how we relate 
to the world around us.
<P>The classical view, held even by deists, was that we 
were creatures of Goda relationship that had vast 
implications for our understandings of right and wrong, and for the 
role of government.  In such a world view, man is neither 
good nor bad but capable of choosing either.  As defined by 
God or natural law, there is both truth and a baseline for 
good that exist outside of man.  And there are basic rights, 
which also exist outside of man and delimit the capacity of 
others to encroach upon him while creating obligations 
toward others.
<P>In contrast, the modern view holds that man himself 
is good and therefore the arbiter of the good.  Since each 
can define his own understanding of what is right, truth 
is re<BR>

 giving.  Thus, we often find that corporations and foundations based 
on business wealth regularly support a left-wing 
intellectual and social agenda.  This activity must be the 
philanthropic counterpart to the Edsel.
<P>But as Mr. Simon makes very clear, there are some 
very good products available to both corporate and 
foundation officials interested in free markets, smaller 
government, individual freedom, and private property.  It would 
certainly be worth more of these officials' time to 
inform themselvesand avail themselvesof these 
&quot;purchase&quot; opportunities.
<P>
<P><B>Dorothy S. Ridings
<P>President
<P>Council on Foundations</B>
<P>
<P>William Simon makes a strong case for his 
argument about what he perceives as wrongheaded corporate 
philanthropy.  But he uses an overly broad brush in painting 
a picture of business leaders whose charitable giving 
does not meet his standards.  In my view, it does not help 
Mr. Simon advance his cause unless he's satisfied with 
simply &quot;preaching to the converted.&quot;
<P>I am disheartened, in fact, by the tone he employs to 
make his case.  Thoughtful people who do not already hold 
his views surely are turned off by language asserting that 
they are &quot;financing the destruction of freedom&quot; with their 
gifts to unnamed organizations that &quot;happily [devour] the 
fruits of capitalism while <BR>
Manne: corporate officials should treat contributions &quot;as normal 
expenditures to 'purchase' a desired product or service.&quot;<BR>
working to poison the tree that bears them.&quot;  Colorful language, smacking of an evil plot.  
Such demonization does not advance his argument.
<P>The central strength of organized philanthropy in 
this country has always been in its diversity.  Deliberation, 
even strong debate, should be encouraged among those 
with differing views on the ramifications of that diversity.  
But characterization that leads to rigid polarization does 
not foster rational conclusions.  Nor does it change 
many minds.<BR>
view, and until we change that understanding, it is 
unlikely that the majority of businessmen will have either the 
intestinal fortitude or the intellectual ammunition to 
understand and defend the foundations of our society.
<P>One final point: I wholeheartedly endorse Simon's 
recommended solutions.  To them I would add the 
observation that because John M. Olin was a keen student of 
human nature and of the long-term problems of bad systems, he 
set up his foundation with a life limited to the likely lifespan 
of the handpicked individual he most trusted, William Simon. 
 While there are various ways to limit perpetuities, I 
would encourage us to look to the sunsetting of foundations as 
a valuable tool in the reform and strengthening of 
philanthropy.

<P>School of Law</B>
<P>
<P>Among the first articles I ever published, over 40 
years ago, was a criticism of the doctrine of corporation law 
that allowed corporations to engage in philanthropic activities. 
 Over the next 20 years I came to see that my position, 
while theoretically correct, was impractical and unworkable. 
 While I still believe, as an old American case had it, 
that &quot;charity <I>qua</I> charity has no seat at the board of 
directors,&quot; this is a long way from approving a rule that would 
allow courts to examine the deepest motives and intentions 
of corporate officials.
<P>Very little of what we term corporate philanthropy 
today is done with the sense of anonymous altruism that 
would have satisfied Maimonides.  Rather, consciously or 
unconsciously,  corporate officials recognize that it is 
good business, and I would never allow judges to interfere 
with straightforward business judgments, no matter what 
they are called.
<P>But since my justification for allowing corporate 
charities is ultimately a profit-oriented one, I would 
strongly endorse William Simon's clarion call for use of 
normal business intelligence in making these contributions.  
In fact, I would even urge corporate and foundation 
officials to go one step further and to view these expenditures not 
as &quot;contributions&quot; or &quot;philanthropy&quot; at all.  Rather, 
they should be seen as normal expenditures to &quot;purchase&quot; 
a desired product or service.
<P>The words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;philanthropy&quot; have today 
been so confounded by liberals to cover only their own set 
of desired goals that it has become difficult for busy 
executives to make subtle distinctions in their

During the ensuing years the ratio rose steadily, reaching $3.42 in 1992.  In 
the first year after President Clinton's election, corporate

<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Right</I> (ratings of 8 and 7).  
These are conservative groups such as the Heritage 
Foundation and Capital Research Center, and libertarian or 
market-liberal groups such as the Cato Institute and Reason 
Foundation.  These organizations promote policy reforms 
that encourage private-sector alternatives to government 
programs, urge tax cuts, call for reduced regulatory burdens 
on businesses, and promote individual freedom and 
responsibility.  These groups received $3.01 million in 
1994a little over eight percent of corporate public-affairs giving.
<P>n<I>Establishment Right</I> (ratings of 6).  
Organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute and the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce generally favor free-market 
policies.  But they also allow for more government 
regulation and are skeptical of radical and systemic changes in 
public policy.  They received $4.85 million, or 13.5 percent 
of corporate public-policy giving, in 1994.
<P>n<I>Centrist</I> (rating of 5).  Think-tanks like the 
Rand Corporation and the Center for Governmental 
Research generally support &quot;good government&quot; reforms.  They 
tend to study specific policy issues and avoid taking 
philosophical or broadly political positions on controversial matters. 
 They received 2.71 percent of corporate public 
affairs giving in 1994the smallest percentage going to 
advocacy.
<P>n<I>Establishment Left</I> (ratings of 4 and 3).  
These groups favor government action to solve most social ills. 
 They support higher taxes, more government spending, 
and more regulation of the economy.  They include the 
Brookings Institution, National Alliance of Business, National 
Urban League, Committee for Economic Development, and 
National Wildlife Federation.  They received $22.88 
million in 1994almost two-thirds of corporate public-policy giving.
<P>n<I>Change-Oriented Left</I> (ratings of 2 and 1).  
This category includes organizations that work for 
extensive government control of social and economic 
institutions, such as the Children's Defense Fund, NAACP, and 
Center <BR>
<B>Advocates for Bigger Government</B>
<P>Much of the Administration's failed legislative 
agenda was crafted and promoted by nonprofit special 
interest advocacy groups headquartered in Washington, D.C.  
Advocacy groups and think-tanks that want more 
government control over the economy published policy papers and 
held press briefings to support the Administration's 
programs while offering their personnel to staff federal 
departments and agencies.  Groups like the Children's Defense 
Fund, once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, pushed for 
government health care and mobilized to scuttle welfare 
reform.  The NAACP, Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Education Fund (MALDEF), and National Urban 
Leagueorganizations that supplied high-ranking officials to 
the Clinton Administrationalso got behind the 
health-care plan.  On the environmental front, groups such as 
the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), Wilderness 
Society, and World Wildlife Fund demanded more 
environmental regulation at the expense of private property owners. 
 LCV president Bruce Babbitt became Secretary of 
the Interior.  A host of nonprofit executives from other 
environmental groups also filled Administration jobs.
<P>The ties between government and big-government 
advocacy groups have never been stronger.  As the 
federal government runs out of money and ideas, it is 
increasingly turning to these groups.  They not only supply 
proposals and lobby to enact them into law.  Increasingly, 
they determine where taxpayer dollars will be spent.  They 
get government jobs, run government programs, and 
spend taxpayers' money.  A large and expanding government is 
in their self-interest.  This much is clear.
<P>
<P><B>Corporate Support for Bigger Government</B>
<P>What is less understandable is how nonprofit and 
tax-exempt advocacy groups can successfully ask 
profit-making and taxpaying corporations for financial support 
for their agenda.  Why do corporations willingly agree to 
their requests for funding?
<P>In 1994, the most recent year for which data is 
widely available, major American corporations gave almost 
$27 million to advocacy groups that promote public 
policies calling for higher taxes, more regulation, and less 
economic freedom for corporations. <I> For every dollar that 
corporations gave to right-of-center and pro-free market 
groups, they gave $3.43 to liberal and left-of-center 
advocacy groups promoting bigger government.</I>
<P>Each year since 1986, Capital Research Center has 
measured corporate giving to public-policy organizations 
and has compared giving to groups on the left and right.  
In 1986, the ratio was $1.64 to $1.00.  <BR>

 liberal or left-of-center.  For their money, corporations in 1994 
supported tax-exempt groups that favor public policies that 
harm business and free enterprise.
<P>Chief among these policies was the Clinton 
health-care proposal.  Its immense and complicated bureaucracy 
coupled with mandated heavy costs on employers threatened 
the survival of many small businesses.  When First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, chair of the President's Health Care 
Task Force, answered business objections by complaining,

in America,&quot; she revealed an attitude that should 
have opened the eyes of corporate leaders.  Many, 
however, continued to contribute to groups like the Children's 
Defense Fund and the NAACP that strongly supported 
Clinton health policies.
<P>In 1994, major corporations also gave to the 
Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, 
Natural Resources Defense Council, and World Wildlife Fund. 
 These groups supported the Administration's ill-fated 
BTU tax on energy the year before.  The tax would have 
increased the price of oil by an estimated 17 percent, coal 
by 15 percent, and natural gas by 11 percent.  But 
apparently many corporations were not outraged by the effort to 
raise taxes and force a reduction in the use of fuel.  In 1994, 
even President Clinton momentarily admitted, &quot;I raised 
your taxes too much.&quot;  Did corporations agree?
<P>When corporations contribute to political advocacy groups that 
want more government programs, they make their own shareholders foot 
the bill twice overas shareholders and as taxpayers.<BR>
 disguise their current policy activism.
<P>In other cases, corporations may distribute 
relatively small contributions as tribute money to buy time and 
avoid harassment.  But the activities of advocacy groups 
during the Clinton years make a mockery of that hope.  
The millions of dollars these groups receive from 
corporations simply enable them to pursue goals that undermine the 
free-enterprise system on which corporations depend.
<P>Of course, some corporations may conclude that 
their well-being ultimately depends on the favor of the 
Administration in power.  That might explain an initial flurry 
of 1993 contributions to the Children's Defense Fund 
and Planned Parenthood.  But this kind of giving yields 
bad public policy and worse philanthropy.
<P>When corporations support advocacy groups that 
want more government entitlements and social services, 
they hurt the recipients of charity as well as charities themselves. 
 This is the sorry lesson of our welfare programs.  
Philanthropy, including corporate philanthropy, should call 
on the desire of good people to do good deeds.  But 
when corporations contribute to political advocacy groups 
that want more government programs, they make their 
own shareholders foot the bill twice overas shareholders 
and as taxpayers.<BR>
<B>Corporate Misgiving</B>
<P>This year's <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy 
</I>contains other examples of foolish giving:
<P>nACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) is a direct-action advocacy group.  
It uses the threat of federal penalties to pressure 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions 
to make higher-risk loans at lower-risk rates to borrowers 
it recommends.  In 1994, BankAmerica, Bank of 
Boston, Chase Manhattan, Fannie Mae, PNC Bank, and the St. 
Paul Companies contributed $483,000 to ACORN.  This is 
an almost six-fold increase in 1993 corporate support 
for ACORN.
<P>nFord Motor Company gave $1,000 to the American Lung Association (ALA), which has lobbied to 
increase EPA emissions standards for automobiles.  ALA's image 
as a non-political public-health group belies its 
aggressive lobbying on a wide range of controversial issues.  Ford 
also donated $10,000 to the World Wildlife Fund, which 
promoted the failed BTU tax to cut fuel consumption 
and increase costs.  What was Ford thinking?
<P>nOil companies Chevron (despite a number two 
rating in our Top Ten) and Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) gave to 
the National Audubon Society and the Center for Marine 
Conservation, both of which oppose offshore oil drilling.  
Chevron, although it gave to groups that support free 
markets, also supported the Trust for Public Lands, which 
also opposes offshore oil drilling.
<P>
<P><B>Harming Charities and Those They Serve</B>
<P>Why do corporations support policy groups whose 
goals are bad for business?  CEOs and managers of 
corporate grantmaking departments may simply be ignorant of 
the agendas of nonprofits applying to them for grants.  
Groups with catchy names and smooth fundraisers often present 
an image at odds with the hardball politics they play in 
Washington.  Large and well-known groups like the 
American Cancer Society, National Audubon Society, and 
Humane Society of the United States trade on their reputations to<BR>

John M. Hood's <I>The Heroic Enterprise</I><BR>
<B>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster</B>
<P>What should business' responsibilities be towards 
the community?  Advocates of &quot;corporate social 
responsibility&quot; argue that businesses should use their profits 
&quot;responsibly,&quot; by which they usually mean making donations 
to liberal causes and organizations.
<P>John Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, 
a market-oriented think tank in Raleigh, North Carolina, 
has a different view.  In <I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business 
and the Common Good</I> (New York: Free Press, 199 
pages, $25.00), he argues that the primary responsibility of 
businesses is not to promote social causes or redistribute 
wealth but, quite simply, to provide needed goods at a 
competitive price.
<P>Take the case of Jerome Lemelson, an inventor 
and philanthropist.  Lemelson has made substantial 
donations to the Smithsonian Institution and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, which co-sponsors the annual 
$300,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for the best American inventor.  
When Lemelson dies, his foundation will have an endowment 
of at least $300,000,000.
<P>But Hood argues that Lemelson should not be 
celebrated primarily for his philanthropy, but for the five 
hundred inventions he has patented.  These include improvements 
in bar code readers, devices that make assembly lines 
more flexible, and the typewriter tape eraser, which 
Lemelson invented in college.  These, Hood argues, are 
Lemelson's main contribution to society.  &quot;No matter how hard he 
tries, there is no possible way that he can give enough 
money away to make his charitable contribution to society 
equal the value of his contributions as an innovator and 
entrepreneur.&quot;
<P>Advocates of corporate social responsibility often 
judge businesses by looking at how much they give.  But 
Hood suggests that a more meaningful criterion is to 
examine whether the goods and services companies produce 
make people's lives better.  Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, 
for example, is renowned by some because it gives 7.5 
percent of its profits to charityfar higher than the average 
corporate gift of one percent.  But its profits come from ice 
cream that, although tasty, is loaded with fat.  Who does 
more good for society, Hood asks: Ben and Jerry's or a 
lower-profile company that makes 55-gallon drums which 
ensure that goods can be transported cheaply, ensuring 
lower prices for everyone?
<P>Hood believes that corporations should practice 
&quot;strategic philanthropy;&quot; that is, they should make grants to 
causes <BR>
Terrence Scanlon, Publisher<BR>
Capital Research Center is a nonpartisan education and research organization
<P>classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public charity.<BR>
CRC, 727 15th Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, 20005 (202) 393-2600  http://www.capitalresearch.org<BR>
that advance a company's interests.  He agrees with 
Sunmark Capital president Menlo Smith, who has said, &quot;because 
our shareholders will always have different charitable 
interests, we concluded long ago that any giving done by 
Sunmark should have a very direct business purpose, and that if 
it does not, the giving should be done individually by 
the shareholders, and not the corporation.&quot;
<P>According to Hood, corporations can practice 
strategic philanthropy in different ways.  Amoco, which has 
long sought a better-educated workforce, has a substantial 
share of its filling stations in urban areas.  Thus, its 
foundation gives mostly to groups seeking to improve education and 
to rebuild inner cities.  Other companies practice 
&quot;cause-related marketing&quot; by making grants in proportion to 
their sales volume.  American Express pioneered this 
approach in 1981 by donating a percentage of the charges made on 
its credit cards to arts organizations in the San Francisco area. 
 It has since launched several national philanthropic 
campaigns, including a 1983 promotion in which a penny 
of every charge was used to help restore the Statue of Liberty. 
 By tying the use of its credit cards to charity, 
American Express has increased card use by 20 percent.
<P>Many corporations also use philanthropy as a means 
to improve employee morale.  General Electric, Questar 
Corp., and Union Planters National Bank encourage employees 
to volunteer at charities in the evenings and on weekends. 
 Researchers at Columbia University and the 
Conference Board have found that such volunteering increases 
workplace productivity.
<P>Hood suggests that one way businesses can improve 
their philanthropy is by supporting organizations that 
promote free enterprise.  Yet he cites data from the Capital 
Research Center showing that many large corporations give 
generously to groups hostile to free markets and limited 
government.  He speculates that corporate giving officers may 
do so to buy off antagonistic anti-business organizations.
<P>This approach, Hood argues, is ineffective.  In the 
long run, companies that support such groups, or that 
make contributions without a clear strategy, are eclipsed in 
the marketplace by competitors that practice strategic 
philanthropy.  Moreover, Hood suggests that advocates of 
corporate social responsibility must recognize that markets 
are not evil, but necessary if businesses are to create the 
wealth that makes philanthropy possible.  &quot;Without an 
efficient market system, there are likely to be more social 
problems (stemming from poverty and technological 
backwardness) on which philanthropists must spend their time and money.&quot;<BR>

On April 27, Heritage Vice President for Educational Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a> 
was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
 According to former Congressman Mickey Edwards, who had organized the curriculum, 
Meyerson's class was rated by the students as one of the course's highlights. 
        
<p>
Though many in the academic community remain openly hostile to conservative 
ideas, The Heritage Foundation's academic outreach programs are attempting 
to break the left's hold on academia. Activities include the Bradley Scholars 
Program, Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership, Resource Bank, and Lectures 
and Seminars.

The Bradley Scholars Program, made possible by a grant from the Lynde and Harry 
Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee, welcomed its eighth class to Washington in 
September: crime reporter <a href="/heritage/staff/carlson.htm">Tucker Carlson</a>, a former Policy Review Assistant 
Editor, who rejoined Heritage after a year as an editorial writer for the Democrat-Gazette 
in Little Rock; <a href="/heritage/staff/toler.htm">Herbert H. Toler, Jr.</a>, an expert on the black church in America, 
who joined Heritage from Union Theological Seminary and Howard University; 
and <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a>, Vice President of the John Locke Foundation, Raleigh, N.C., 
a prominent state think tank.
<p>
The Bradley Scholars Program provides writers and academics with a venue in 
Washington for conducting long-term research and writing projects geared to 
current public policy issues.

Forty college and university faculty members and advanced graduate students 
were named Heritage Foundation Salvatori Fellows in 1994.
<p>

Focus of the Salvatori Center's Annual Conference for Academic Leadership, 
held May 11-12, was "The Constitution of Ordered Liberty: Academic Questions 
for the 21st Century."  More than 100 scholars, academic administrators, and 
journalists attended the conference. The annual Salvatori Awards for Academic 
Excellence were presented to Henry Manne, George Mason University School of 
Law, Fairfax, VA, and Edward Banfield, Harvard University.
<p>
Heritage's Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership was established in 1991 
to encourage academic excellence and stimulate the study and discussion in 
higher education of the ideas and principles that form the foundations of America's 
political and cultural traditions. Salvatori Center programs are made possible 
by a grant from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles.

The "networking" arm of Heritage's Educational Affairs program, the <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> is a cooperative exchange program involving more than 2,000 university 
professors, academic research centers, educational foundations, and policy 
groups in the United States and abroad. The purpose of the Resource Bank, which 
was established in 1977, is to help conservative scholars and policy specialists 
participate more fully in the policy-making process.
<p>

Some 300 Resource Bank members from a record 130 organizations attended the 
17th Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago in April. The theme of the two-day 
conference was "Restoring the American Community: The `New Citizenship' at 
Work," a phrase coined by Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce to describe 
the rebirth of grassroots activism around the country.  The program highlighted 
the efforts of volunteers, activists, entrepreneurs, and citizen-legislators.
<p>
The Resource Bank's working groups focused in 1994 on state issues, public 
interest law, unfunded federal mandates, family issues, and foreign and defense 
policy issues.

What do film critic Michael Medved, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy 
Boorda, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and the Ambassadors 
of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico have in common? They all spoke at 
The Heritage Foundation last fall, all in the same week. Their presentations 
were overshadowed that week by another Heritage speaker: California Gov. Pete 
Wilson, whose denunciation of costly federal mandates made headline news around 
the country and was broadcast repeatedly by SPAN, the Cable-Satellite Public 
Affairs Network.
<p>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation in 1994 remained one of Washington's leading forums. 
Thousands attended the more than 100 public lectures and seminars, and millions 
more watched the proceedings on public-affairs television or read the published 
lectures.
<p>
<B>Among 1994's notable events:</B>
<p>
 The inauguration of a 10-part lecture series, "Sweet Land of Liberty: Strengthening 
America's Culture," sponsored by the Salvatori Foundation. 
<p>
 The Ambassadors Forum on Free Trade, a panel discussion with the four previously 
mentioned ambassadors, held just weeks before the "Summit of the Americas."

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Foreign and Defense Policy -- Heritage</TITLE>

"The Clinton administration does take national interests into account when 
formulating foreign policy. The trouble is, they are frequently the interests 
of other nations," Lawrence Di Rita, Deputy Director of Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies, told reporters in one of several well-attended briefings in 
1994. 
<P>

<p>
Heritage analysts throughout the year continued their efforts to bring needed 
clarity and focus to America's meandering foreign policy. The big picture was 
provided by the updated monograph, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," which went 
into a second printing in 1994. With more than 10,000 copies in print, the 
global blueprint is now used by more than two dozen universities and graduate 
schools, including America's war colleges, as a primer on foreign policy and 
national security. The book explains how U.S. national interests should be 
used to establish foreign policy goals, how to evaluate potential threats to 
those interests, and how to build and maintain the military forces needed to 
respond to potential threats.
<P>

<p>
Individual papers during the year examined the dangers of putting U.S. forces 
under foreign command as part of U.N. "peacekeeping" missions, warned of the 
danger of cutting too deeply into the U.S. defense budget, urged the United 
States not to abandon the idea of building missile defenses, and developed 
a strategy for revamping the U.S. foreign-aid program.

With the approval of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) shortly 
after Thanksgiving, Heritage's ongoing efforts to promote the global expansion 
of free trade reached another important milestone. The long march, however, 
is far from over: Of the 101 countries ranked on Heritage's "Index of Economic 
Freedom," released at year's end, just 25 had free or "mostly free" trading 
policies.
<P>


One of the main objectives of Heritage's two-year-old American Trader Initiative, 
a joint effort involving both the business and policy communities,  is the 
liberalization of the rules governing international commerce. The program is 
based on the belief not only that free trade furthers U.S. national interests 
by creating new business opportunities for American companies, but that economic 
freedom helps spawn political freedom as well. The long-term goal of the program 
is a free-trade area encompassing both the Western Hemisphere and Pacific Rim. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to their work on the GATT agreement, Heritage trade experts pushed 
the administration to make trade liberalization the centerpiece of two important 
1994 summit meetings: the November meeting in Indonesia of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the December '94 "Summit of the Americas" 
in Miami. In both cases, the United States and its trading partners agreed 
to phase out all trade barriers - by the year 2005 in the Americas and by the 
year 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region.

Just one day after The Heritage Foundation released its first-ever global report 
card on economic freedom, Sen. Mitch McConnell 
(R-KY), incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations 
Subcommittee, suggested major changes in America's $14 billion-per-year foreign 
aid program. As Heritage Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and 
Defense Studies Kim Holmes told reporters at a Dec. 16 media briefing, most 
U.S. development aid is being given to countries "that don't deserve it" because 
their state-controlled economies will waste it. Countries with free economies, 
he noted, generally don't need U.S. aid. 
<P>


<P>
Earlier in the week, Holmes had said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed page article 
that "People in Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Ukraine are not poor because 
wealthy people in the West haven't been generous toward them." They are poor, 
he said, because their governments' "misguided economic policies" retard economic 
growth and prosperity.
<P>

<P>

This long-overdue debate over U.S. foreign-aid policy was precipitated  by 
the publication of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 258-page comparative 

analysis compiled by Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a> and Thomas Sheehy.  Released on Dec. 12, the "Index" examines the economies of 101 countries. As Investor's 
Business Daily noted, Heritage created the "Index," which is similar to Freedom 
House's annual country-by-country survey of political freedom, "to help U.S. 
and international policy-makers better craft their aid policies. If aid money 
is given to a country that is following poor economic policies, the chances 
are good it will be wasted or do little, if any, good."

<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>enter</H3></CENTER>

Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings on Heritage's 
"Index of Economic Freedom" - and eight of the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific 
region. When the United States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which 
belong to the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) - the 
more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the 20 freest economies in the world. 
The APEC nations also now account for 40 percent of all global trade.
<P>

<P>

In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community, The 
Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established in 1983. Today, 
the Center is recognized on both sides of the Pacific as one of the most important 
research and policy centers on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting 
the United States and Asia.
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> 
and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong case in 1994 for significantly 
upgrading U.S. relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country 
of more than 20 million people that continues to be treated as a second-class 
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow Daryl Plunk and Richard 
V. Allen, National Security Advisor to President Reagan and Chairman of the 
Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council, provided Washington with much-needed 
guidance on defusing the growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program. And Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda 
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the 18 member countries 
set a "time certain" for establishing a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the 
topic of an Oct. 27 Asian Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, 
U.S. Trade Representative for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman 
of the U.S. International Trade Commission.   
<P>

<P>

The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) 
hosted several "newsmaker" breakfasts during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), 
then ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the 
North Korean nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat, 
 and Bradley O'Leary, a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional 
elections. And Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed "The Index of Economic Freedom" 
and proposed changes in U.S. foreign aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's programs 
continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment for Korean Studies.

Russian political scientist Evgueni Volk was appointed coordinator of the Heritage 
Foundation's Moscow Office in 1994, succeeding Senior Fellow Jeffrey Gayner, 
who had directed the office since its opening in 1993. 
<P>
Heritage's Moscow office is now seen in Russia as a neutral meeting ground 
where reformers can work out their public differences in private. This is done 
through the Heritage Reform Forum, a monthly "summit" meeting of Moscow's leading 
reform politicians, businessmen, and journalists.    
<P>
The Moscow Office also is involved in more traditional policy analysis. Volk 
and Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies Ariel Cohen distribute 
draft legislation being considered by the Russian parliament to experts in 
the United States, Europe, and Russia. Comments and suggestions are then sent 
to members of the parliament and appropriate staff. During 1994, legislation 
on defense, "peacekeeping" operations, lobbying, and non-governmental organizations 
was refined in this way.

<title>Letter to Congress from Jeane Kirkpatrick on SDI-ABM</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
June 13, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Member of Congress:
<p>
The overriding issue in defense policy for our times is the capacity of America to defend itself.  For most of our history, what George Washington described as "our blessed location" made us invulnerable to attack by hostile nations.  We are no longer invulnerable and we are presently without the capacity to defend ourselves against ballistic missiles.
<p>
Today, rogue nations are determined to build weapons of mass destruction and acquire ballistic missile technology which will permit these weapons to be delivered over long distances.  Most Americans do not yet understand our vulnerability to such attacks.  Most Americans do not yet understand that for the first time in our history, when we speak of defense matters, we should be talking about our capacity to defend our territory.
<p>
The Dellums and Spratt amendments to H.R. 1530 are completely inadequate, very shortsighted and extremely outdated.  Neither is worthy of your support.  The one proposes to economize where economy is the least appropriate.  The Dellums cuts will cripple the development of national defense systems.  The other sacrifices American security in a vain effort to preserve the ABM Treaty.  The ABM Treaty, designed for a bipolar world, always had dubious value.  It is now wholly outdated.  It's only relevance to the contemporary world is to hamper an effective effort to defend America.
<p>
The development of missile defenses today is technologically and economically feasible.  We can speak and act with confidence in the world only when we have the capacity to defend ourselves and our adversaries understand this.  It is time for the United States to defend the American people.
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
<br>
Jack Kemp<br>
Jeane Kirkpatrick

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - President's Message -- Heritage</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2><I><FONT SIZE = "+3">P</FONT>resident's <FONT SIZE = "+3">M</FONT>essage</I></H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Wow, What a Year!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
Early on the morning of November 9, 1994, as I sat contemplating the "tsunami," 
or shock wave, that the national elections had unleashed on official Washington, 
I noticed a copy of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>" in my bookcase, a book which Heritage 
published in 1988.
<P>
In the Foreword to that book, a young Georgia Congressman wrote, "Every citizen 
should be concerned about the arrogance and corruption of the present day Congress. 
 At stake is the liberty of the American public. must reform Congress to make 
it truly representative once again."
<P>
Newt Gingrich had it right. And on Nov. 8, millions of Americans expressed 
that concern at the ballot box by sending to Washington and the statehouses 
and legislatures of America an army of lawmakers dedicated to reforming Congress 
and finishing the conservative revolution Ronald Reagan began in 1980.
<P>
The following week, at the largest President's Club meeting in Heritage's history, 
that same Georgia Congressman gave one of his first public addresses as the 
future Speaker of  the U.S. House of Representatives - the first Republican 
speaker in 40 years. "Heritage," Gingrich said, "is without question the most 
far-reaching conservative organization in the country in the war of  ideas, 
and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally 
across the planet."
<P>

California Gov. Pete Wilson, three days later, also visited us at Heritage, 
giving a major national address on the ways in which liberalism had distorted 
the relationship between the state and federal governments. Governor Wilson, 
who had spoken earlier in the year at a meeting of our Governors' Forum,  described 
Heritage "as an island of clear thinking and common sense amid the fuzzy-headed 
liberalism of Washington.  Here at Heritage you have long been champions of 
the idea of limited government in order to expand individual opportunity, an 
idea that was at the heart of last week's ballot box rebellion."
<P>
The impact of all this really hit home a week later when Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government canceled the orientation program it had been holding for 
newly elected members of Congress since 1972. The reason?  Lack of interest: 
Most members of Congress's Class of 1994 had decided to attend the Heritage 
Foundation/Empower America orientation conference. As Harvard's hometown newspaper, 
the liberal Boston Globe, said in a major article, "In the capricious business 
of supplying politicians with academic expertise and advice, if Harvard's star 
is fading, The Heritage Foundation's is surely on the ascent."
<P>

<p>
What a month November was. What a year!

<P>
The important thing to remember is that all of this didn't just happen.  Just 
as Heritage drew up the battle plan for the first conservative insurgency against 
Washington's liberal fortress with our "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/mnd2.html">Mandate for Leadership</a>" series, we 
also have had a major role in fashioning the new conservative agenda.  Heritage 
welcomed 1994 with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," first-of-its-kind briefing book for congressional 
candidates. "Issues '94" provided comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform.
<P>
Later in the year our analysts were asked for their input on the House GOP 
leadership's proposal to do the unthinkable: tell the American voters where 
they stand on the important issues of the day. The result was the "Contract 
with America." 
<P>
This was followed by still another major set of recommendations for the the 
conservative 104th Congress, "The New Member's Guide to the Issues."
<P>
As New York's Village Voice, one of the bellwethers of counterculture liberalism, 
said of the new conservative agenda: "The driving force behind this conservative 
program is the Heritage Foundation, which over the last decade has occupied 
center stage as the preeminent think tank in Washington .... Heritage was the 
architect of the attack on the New Deal Congress, and has been an important 
force in developing the assault on the liberal-minded federal civil service, 
the drive for privatization, and the overall philosophy of free market economics."
<P>

<P>
All of this was accomplished as the men and women of Heritage went about a 
range of activities that made 1994 the single most productive year in our 21-year 
history. We developed "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," which already is redefining 
the U.S. foreign aid debate; produced a comprehensive tax-relief and deficit-reduction 
plan, "Putting Families First," which became the official alternative budget 
of congressional Republicans in 1994; provided much of the intellectual ammunition 
that led to the demise of health-care "reforms" that would have put the federal 
government in charge of the trillion-dollar U.S. health-care system; played 
a major role in the GATT debate; exposed the crime bill as little more than 
another pork-laden social-spending bill; crafted a welfare reform plan that 
would truly "end welfare as we know it"; began work on a major study of agriculture 
policy, with publication timed for the 1995 debate on the farm bill; and launched 
a new institution-wide program, the American Trader Initiative, to push for 
a liberalized trade policy that dramatically increases international business 
opportunities.          
<P>

Clearly, 1994 was a banner year in terms of  policy development. But there 
was much more:
<P>
... Heritage military analysts, in a series of studies examining the administration's 
defense budget, found that the administration had underfunded its own defense 
plan more than $100 billion over five years.
<P>
... Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, one of the country's leading voices 
on cultural policy and a  featured speaker at our April Board Meeting & Public 
Policy Seminar, saw his "The Book of Virtues" stay at the top of the national 
bestseller lists. Touchstone Books, meanwhile, published an expanded and updated 
version of Bennett's landmark Heritage study, "The Index of Leading Cultural 
Indicators." 
<P>
... A seminal study by Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, chronicling 
the terrible consequences to children and society of out-of-wedlock births, 
sent shockwaves across the country, adding a new sense of urgency to the continuing 
debate over welfare reform.
<P>
... We also released the second edition of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," 
which remains the only comprehensive conservative blueprint for post-Cold War 
foreign and defense policy.
<P>
... The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) was re-established 
under Heritage's sponsorship; and
<P>
... A record 130 organizations joined us at Heritage's 17th Annual <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> Meeting.
<P>
Major advances in our computer capabilities, meanwhile, provided Heritage analysts 
with a powerful new analytical tool rivaling that of the government itself. 
For example: Using our computer model, Heritage analysts were able to measure 
the impact of health-care proposals on businesses, workers, families, and the 
states.
<P>
In addition to the vastly expanded computer capabilities, we also upgraded 
our radio broadcast facilities, enabling talk show hosts to air their programs 
live from Heritage's studios on Capitol Hill. And our magazine, <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, 
continued to grow, reaching another circulation milestone - 30,000. As Boston 
Globe columnist David Warsh wrote, "No magazine has been more vivid in conveying 
the cultural breadth and depth of the conservative imagination."
<P>
These are just a few of the highlights from an incredibly productive, whirlwind 
year. Heritage also remained one of Washington's leading policy forums, with 
dozens of  lectures, seminars, and debates filling our Lehrman Auditorium and 
Van Andel Conference Center. 


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>eople <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>re <FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy</CENTER></H3>
<P>
As you know, when The Heritage Foundation was first established in 1973 we 
made a conscious decision to be different from Washington's other "think tanks." 
 Our goal - then, as now - was to have an impact on the national public policy 
debate, not just publish research papers and host conferences. To do this, 
we identified target markets in the Congress, the administration, and the news 
media and then designed our research product to meet the needs of the marketplace. 

<P>
Today we are a permanent Washington institution. But we still pride ourselves 
on our originality and inventiveness; on steering the debate, not just responding 
to it. 
<P>
What enables us to do this?  Our people - who are among the chief intellectual 
resources of Washington's new conservative establishment.
<P>
During 1994, we made several important changes in our management team. <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew 
Gayner</a> was named Vice President for External Relations and will oversee Heritage's 
outreach to the business community, conservative policy organizations, and 
the nation's governors. <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a>, a former Defense Department official 
and a Japan specialist, was named Director of our Asian Studies Center. Bridget 
Wagner, a 13-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of Business Relations. 
And Margaret Bonilla, a seven-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of 
Development.
<P>
Notable staff additions included <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, who was named 
Senior Policy Analyst, and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, who joined us as Senior Fellow in 
Statistical Policy Analysis.  
<P>
With sadness we note the passing of three giants of the conservative movement: 
Dr. Russell Kirk, a long-time Heritage Distinguished Scholar, lecturer, critic, 
conscience of the conservative movement, and author of dozens of books,  including 
"The Conservative Mind"; Dr. Walter Judd, conservative leader, American patriot, 
recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a dedicated member of The 
Heritage Foundation; and Shelby Cullom Davis, the New York investment banker 
and former Ambassador to Switzerland who served with great distinction as Heritage's 
long-time Board Chairman. The memory of these three great Americans will live 
on at Heritage, as will the impact they had on America and the world.
<P>
While we continue to take great pride in our work, we realize that it is possible 
only because of the continued generous support of our donors. We thank them, 
sincerely. In 1994, income topped $25.5 million, most of it coming from the 
200,000 individuals, foundations, and businesses that comprise the Heritage 
family.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>he <FONT SIZE = "+2>F</FONT>uture</H3></CENTER>
<P>
What about 1995 and beyond? Conservatives have spent the past 20 years building 
a broad network of institutions dedicated to common-sense government  - think 
tanks, state-based research organizations, public interest law groups, radio 
talk shows, on-line computer networks, even a conservative television network 
(soon to be joined by one or more others).  With these institutions solidly 
in place we got our message out. It was heard and understood. 
<P>
Heritage will play a very active role in shaping the new Washington. Our agenda 
 includes reductions in taxes and federal spending - including the elimination 
of several government departments, agencies, programs, and functions - welfare 
and entitlement reform, a revival of federalism, de-regulation of the economy, 
restoring defense readiness, protecting the United States against possible 
missile attack, stopping the spread of global terrorism, and re-examining U.S. 
foreign aid. 
<P>
We are starting an exciting journey that should result in a major change in 
the relationship between the American people and their government. All of us 
at Heritage look forward to being a part of this promising new chapter in American 
history.

BADEN</P><P>            AT a conference last October, I listened to a speech by Gregory Benford, a respected biophysicist and acclaimed writer of science fiction. He noted that the 19th century had been dominated scientifically and culturally by chemistry, the 20th by physics, and predicted the 21st would be dominated by biology.</P><P>       Professor Benford is undoubtedly correct that the coming &quot;Biological Century&quot; promises staggering benefits, benefits likely to rival those wrought by chemistry and physics. But there will also be resistance. Before we can judge how to react to biological developments and their opponents, it may be helpful to consider some relevant facts.</P><P>      One important point is that biotechnology has already produced many useful innovations. For example, bioengineered human insulin has reduced the discomfort and inconveniences of diabetes. Drought- and disease-resistant crops have dramatically improved yields worldwide and reduced the need for fertilizers, pesticides and cropland. Perhaps most impressive of all, the ambitious Human Genome Project is already increasing our knowledge of genetics and revealing the causes of many inheritable diseases.</P><P>      Consider one potentially beneficial innovation: synthetic bovine somatotropin (BST), a replica of the hormone that stimulates lactation in cows. Synthetic BST supplements cows' natural hormones, increasing milk production by an average of 9 pounds per cow per day. It is environmentally beneficial because it increases the amount of milk that can be produced from a given amount of grains and grasses. But such wonders are costly. Monsanto, a leading pharmaceutical company, spent an estimated $300 to $500 million developing BST during the 1980s.</P><P>      BST has undergone extensive safety testing. In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that its use poses no danger to humans or cows. The FDA found that milk from cows treated with BST is virtually indistinguishable from other cows' milk. It has the same proteins, nutrients and concentrations of BST as milk from untreated cows. The National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization have also found BST to be completely safe for humans.</P><P>      In spite of the financial and research investments made to ensure BST's effectiveness and safety, certain groups have strongly opposed its introduction. The opposition has three sources: genuine fears that modified organisms may be harmful to humans or the environment; political entrepreneurs who seek to benefit by creating a crisis atmosphere, and special interests whose political privileges are threatened by its introduction.</P><P>      Such opportunistic opposition to innovation has great risks. It can increase the already significant costs of developing products like BST, slowing their rate of introduction and denying people their benefits.</P><P>      Apprehension regarding BST is understandable and I, too, urge caution. But after years of study and research, little, if any, danger is likely. Bioengineered organisms have caused no harm to people or the environment even after dozens of field tests and the escape of millions of microbes from laboratories. The National Academy of Sciences, Ecological Society of America and most DNA biologists agree that biotechnology poses minimal risks if properly monitored. BST is no exception.</P><P>      The opposition voiced by political entrepreneurs and special interests is less principled. As demonstrated by the Alar scare (not a biotech product), these groups are quite willing to purposely mislead the public through incorrect science and media hype.</P><P>      Jeremy Rifkin is perhaps the most prominent political entrepreneur in the realm of biotechnology. Rifkin has made a career from fear-mongering - authoring numerous anti-technological books and running his &quot;nonprofit&quot; Foundation for Economic Trends. Ignoring scientific evidence and preying on the public's lack of information, he has implied that BST and other biotech products are unhealthy or unnatural. By creating public opposition, he increases the pressure on legislators and regulators to institute policies that slow biotechnological innovation.</P><P>      The conflict over BST is a harbinger of things to come. If selfishly motivated individuals are allowed to manipulate public opinion and the regulatory process without being accountable for the accuracy of their facts, we will seriously curtail the development of biotechnology. This would be an enormous tragedy because the benefits it promises are immense and within reach.</P><P>      The century of biology is neither guaranteed nor automatic. If it is to blossom we must ensure that regulatory decisions follow sound science and the interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of special interests. The alternative will leave all of us poorer. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

<TITLE> Support the Defend America Act </TITLE>
</HEAD>
May 21, 1996
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
Dear Member of Congress:
<blockquote>
<p>
We are writing to urge your support for a vital piece of legislation that is expected to come to a vote on the House floor later this week -- the "Defend America Act of 1996" (H.R. 3144).  The Defend America Act would make it U.S. policy to build, by 2003, a national missile defense that would protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack.
<p>
Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.  These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few.  Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat.  Even a single missile launched at our nation -- whether deliberately or by accident -- would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
Fortunately, there is no need to perpetuate American vulnerability to this threat.  The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states -- and to do so at an affordable cost.  The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously.  The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years.  They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner -- before they materialize.  Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.  The Spratt amendment to H.R. 3144 would perpetuate the Administration's "go slow" approach to missile defense and ensure that America remains undefended well into the next century.  It should be voted down.
<P>
The United States is working with Israel to provide that country with defense against ballistic missile attack.  Commenting recently on this, Secretary of Defense William Perry noted that this defensive program "should, therefore, be stabilizing on the one hand.  On the other hand, it should reduce any incentive of any country to launch a missile because they would see it would be ineffective."  Empower America agrees and notes that an effective missile defense would also deter attacks on the United States. 
<P>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security.  But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack.  We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act.  
<P><BR>
Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Vin Weber

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Membership -- Heritage</TITLE>

<CENTER><B>America's Most Broadly Supported Think Tank</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/mbrship.html">Join the Heritage
Foundation!</a>
<p>
The Heritage Foundation received another vote of confidence from its members 
and donors in 1994:  For the 21st consecutive year, income from contributions 
was up - to an all-time record of $21.5 million - as was Heritage's influence 
and impact.
<p>
With more than 200,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters, The 
Heritage Foundation remains the most broadly supported research institute in 
the United States. Of the $25.5 million in total income - a 12 percent increase 
over 1993 ($22.9 million) - 50 percent was provided by individuals, 25 percent 
by foundations, and 9 percent by business contributors.
<P>
But Heritage members and supporters do more than write checks: They receive 
Heritage publications, attend meetings, visit with Heritage representatives, 
and learn about the issues of the day. Heritage's members fuel the institution's 
success in two ways: They provide the financial resources needed for Heritage 
to do its job in Washington, and many of them take the knowledge they gain 
through their personal involvement with Heritage back to their local communities.
<P>


Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has made it a firm policy to accept no 
government funding, perform no contract work, and maintain no political or 
academic affiliations. All contributions are voluntary and tax deductible under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This enables Heritage to maintain 
its independence; it also means that Heritage's officers and staff must earn 
the trust of members and supporters each year.
<P>

Most Heritage donors are motivated by two things: They agree with the conservative 
principles upon which Heritage's work is based, and they believe The Heritage 
Foundation uses their money wisely. Said one President's Club member, "If it 
weren't for ... The Heritage Foundation, I would despair for our country. You 
give me a reason for optimism." Added a corporate Executive Committee Member, 
"The Heritage Foundation has earned a reputation as an incubator of ideas ... 
[that] foster democracy, free enterprise and political freedom. We remain convinced 
that there are ample returns on our investment in Heritage and believe the 
important work of The Heritage Foundation needs to continue." And a Heritage 
Associate put it this way: "As our government becomes more oppressive and as 
our culture deteriorates look increasingly to Heritage for solutions. Keep 
up the good work."
<P>
Heritage strives to involve its supporters in the war of ideas in a number 
of ways.  During 1994, the Heritage staff held more than 400 one-on-one meetings 
with individual, foundation, and corporate donors to hear their views and to 
report on Heritage accomplishments. Heritage publications provide another avenue 
of communications. Heritage Members News, published quarterly, is distributed 
to all  200,000 members; members of the President's Club, Associates, and Founder-level 
donors also receive Heritage studies. Regular programs and events for donors 
featuring presentations by policymakers and Heritage experts include the following:

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">F</FONT>ounders</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Founders are those individuals, foundations, and corporations who 
provide $100,000 or more during the year to The Heritage Foundation.  In 1994, 
30 donors gave at the Founders level. Founders are invited to the Annual Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar and to a special Founders briefing at Heritage. 
Those who attended the 1994 briefing, held on  December 7, were able to talk 
shop with Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; Vin Weber, Vice Chairman of Empower 
America; and Michael Joyce, President of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>eritage <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>ssociates</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Associates, those who give $10,000 or more, are invited, along with 
Heritage Trustees and Founders, to participate in Heritage's Annual  Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar. The 1994 meeting, the ninth in this series, 
was held in Amelia Island, FL, in April. Featured speakers were Distinguished 
Fellows William Bennett and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, author 
and Heritage Trustee Midge Decter, and author Charles Murray. Rep. Tillie Fowler 
(R-FL), who represents the northeastern Florida district in which Amelia Island 
lies, welcomed the more than 150 guests.

With the future Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, as the lead-off speaker, 
the Nov. 15 President's Club meeting was the largest in the program's 12-year 
history. The day-long event attracted more than 500 Heritage friends and supporters 
for a series of discussions on Washington's political reordering. In his speech, 
"What the Elections Mean to Conservatives," Gingrich said, "There are changes 
we have to make, and we badly need The Heritage Foundation's help intellectually 
in understanding how to make them." Dinner speaker Jack Kemp focused on Heritage's 
pivotal role as the idea factory for the conservative revolution.
<P>

Representative Gingrich also was the keynote speaker at Heritage's May President's 
Club meeting. Other speakers at the meeting included Rep. Tim Hutchinson (R-AR) 
and, at the Executive Committee luncheon, Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA).

Health care issues dominated public policy in 1994.  With many medical doctors 
feeling excluded from the health-care debate, Heritage Chairman David R. Brown, 
M.D.,  started the Physician's Council. The inaugural meeting, in June, featured 
Sens. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Connie Mack (R-FL), co-sponsors of the Consumer 
Choice Health Security Act, and Bernadine Healy, former Director of the National 
Institutes of Health.  A second meeting of the Physician's Council was held 
in conjunction with the November President's Club meeting.  Nearly 700 doctors 
had joined the Council by year end.

<FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>eminars</H3></CENTER>

Issues and ideas also were on the agenda at two regional policy seminars held 
in 1994: July 18 in Monterey, CA, where Jack Kemp's keynote address focused

1994 saw continued growth in the Windsor Society, a special group of dedicated 
Heritage Members who contribute to the Heritage Foundation's long-range financial 
objectives through their estate plans or other planned gifts. In 1994, twenty-nine 
Heritage members made commitments to Heritage totaling more than $3.5 million. 
These generous gifts will ensure that there will always be a principled conservative 
institution in Washington fighting for free enterprise, limited government, 
traditional American values, and a strong national defense. 

In February 1994, the eighth meeting of the Windsor Society was held at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Scottsdale, AZ. The three-day conference focused on the crucial 
battle over health care that was unfolding in Washington. Heritage experts 
and more than 40 Heritage members discussed the importance of the health care 
debate in terms of America's future. Presentations on estate planning were 
also available to interested Heritage members, not only to support their deeply 
held conservative beliefs, but also to assist them and their families in their 
financial planning.  
<P>
The Windsor Society continues to help build the future financial support Heritage 
will need to continue fighting well into the 21st century for the values and 
principles which built America.

And many environmentalists are gloating.</P><P>      They are using the grizzly, the wolf and the salmon - symbolically some of America's most important creatures - together with one of the most obscure, the northern spotted owl, to hold development hostage.</P><P>      But if pushed to its ultimate extreme, the Endangered Species Act could so disrupt economies that pressure to amend it - or challenge it on constitutional grounds - will become irresistible.</P><P>      Environmentalists do a good job of explaining the prime rule of ecology: Everything is tied to everything else. We can never do just one thing; everything in an ecosystem is linked. This is why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat, such as the spotted owl, are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>      However, we are also learning that such interdependence applies equally to political and economic systems: There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences.</P><P>      Those of us who value the endangered wolf, grizzly or owl's habitat should ask the same question for any actions taken under the Endangered Species Act - especially when that law begins to affect private-property rights.</P><P>      The political process inevitably links economics and ecology. People's ecological concern is directly related to their security and prosperity. Since economic as well as ecological systems are highly dynamic, proposed changes are likely to bring unintended mischief. We are seeing this unfold with the spotted owl.</P><P>      The reaction from the timber industry and many Northwest politicians to preserving a habitat of 11.3 million acres was vitriolic. At a rally in May, Washington Gov. Booth Gardner told 3,000 loggers and their families: &quot;The latest designation of habitat is unnecessary, unacceptable and inconsistent with the law, and we can't allow it.&quot;</P><P>      On the same day, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer barred the U.S. Forest Service from selling any more timber in northern-spotted-owl habitat until it finished writing rules to ensure the bird's survival.</P><P>      If there is any certainty in the spotted-owl saga, it is that the government will not voluntarily compensate private landowners for their losses in helping to save the owl. Like the spotted owl, property rights are threatened, if not endangered.</P><P>      The critical habitat plan for preserving the spotted owl has many unintended consequences. Some of these, like the loss of timber-related jobs, are obvious. Others are less apparent. Among these hidden consequences is the impact on management incentives of property owners.</P><P>      There is no doubt that the Endangered Species Act applies to private lands. Under Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, private landowners are prohibited from &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;harming&quot; listed species. There is nothing in the act that speaks to the taking or harming of private-property rights, but there is such a provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</P><P>      The spotted-owl controversy is the tip of the iceberg of conflict between endangered-species protection and private-property rights. The Fish and Wildlife Service also is on the verge of listing the Columbia River sockeye salmon as endangered.</P><P>      The sockeye is only the first of many anadromous fish runs being studied by the agency. The potential impact for private rights in land and water could make the spotted-owl regulations seem insignificant.</P><P>      The Endangered Species Act specifically states that economic factors are not to play a role in the decision to list a species as threatened or endangered.</P><P>       Many biologists even questioned the appropriateness of placing two economists on the recovery task force for the spotted owl. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit if they do not.</P><P>      A far better solution would be to use economic incentives to help protect endangered species. One approach would create a Biodiversity Trust Fund, derived from a fixed percentage of the revenues from public land activities - such as logging, mining, grazing and recreation - that impinge on wildlife habitat.</P><P>      If these resources were sold at fair market value, and 10 percent were paid to the fund, between $500 million and $1 billion per year would be available to protect critical wildlife habitat.</P><P>      A Biodiversity Fund board of trustees, consisting of respected scientists with specialties in fields such as evolutionary biology and restoration ecology, could be nominated by the National Academy of Sciences to allocate this money.</P><P>       They could buy conservation easements in the areas where disturbances might harm listed species. They also could pay &quot;bounties&quot; to land managers if an endangered species successfully breeds on their land.</P><P>      The trust fund would completely change the incentives surrounding rare and endangered species. Private landowners would support, rather than oppose, the listing of new species because of the potential that they could get paid for harboring such species.              In the end, protection would be possible for a wider number of species without all the political and legal turmoil that now surrounds the Endangered Species Act.</P><P>      And the Endangered Species Act might no longer be endangered.</P><P>________________</P><P> John Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), with offices in Bozeman, Mont., and Seattle. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P>I OFTEN defend the habitat of species I care for deeply: grizzly bears, wild trout and birds of all kinds. But, like most people, I care even more about preserving the quality of my own habitat, my neighborhood and community. Within that habitat, we not only worry about pollution and disease, we are concerned with human predators (i.e. criminals).</P><P>       This concern has recently resurfaced in a vigorous debate about the merits of gun control and its impact on crime. Is it wise to support gun control? This is a difficult question, one worthy of careful attention.</P><P>     National Public Radio, The New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly exemplify progressive thinking on many matters of social policy. Hence it is revealing that they have recently featured articles challenging the conventional view that citizens' access to handguns should be severely constrained. In these articles, Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University's School of Law and James Q. Wilson of UCLA argue that this sort of policy is likely to be ineffective and indeed counterproductive.</P><P>     In Polsby and Wilson's view, handguns are tools that give their owners an advantage when bargaining or interacting with others.</P><P>     For example, I am a healthy, athletic, 6-foot, 190-pound male - a difficult mark for an unarmed person. However, if I left my neighborhood cash machine some evening and a 97-pound weakling with an Uzi demanded my money, he would surely get it. The Uzi gives my assailant the upper hand.</P><P>     If guns are tools they are subject to the laws of economics. Using economic logic, we can ask: Who will give up their guns if an aggressive program of handgun control is enacted?</P><P>       People who expect to use guns frequently, such as criminals, find them very valuable. They are unlikely to easily relinquish their guns. People who value guns very little, perhaps professors who live and work in safe neighborhoods, are  most likely to relinquish them. Thus gun control will have the most impact on those least likely to commit crimes. Should gun control succeed, the habitat of once-safe communities will degrade as still more armed criminals confront an increasingly vulnerable (i.e. unarmed) populace.</P><P>     Consider a lesson from the Montana ranch my wife and I own. For many years, we ran sheep on rangeland between our low-lying fields and the higher-elevation timberlands. Although the area is beautiful, it is also burdened with an abundance of predators. We suffered losses from bears, coyotes and an occasional mountain lion. Late summer, when coyote pups learn to hunt, was the worst time. They wounded many sheep while learning to kill. Tending wounded sheep was wrenching and most unpleasant because the cuts are hidden under the wool, where they often become infected and maggot infested. But we felt an obligation to care for and protect them.</P><P>     In the late 1970s we adopted an ancient strategy to defend our stock: guard dogs. Long before the invention of guns, steel traps and poison, Europeans trained guard dogs to stay with livestock to protect it from wolves, bears and human raiders. Though hardly perfect, this strategy works quite well. Guard dogs very rarely kill predators, even when two 100-pound dogs confront a 25-pound coyote and her pups. And because our dogs, a Komondor and a Sharplenenitz, are big and white and look much like sheep from a distance, the predators cannot easily know when the dogs are nearby and when they are not. The dogs raise the cost of predation by &quot;arming&quot; the sheep. They make our stock too risky a target for most coyotes, cougars and bears.</P><P>     An armed household is like a herd of sheep protected by guard dogs. A serious human predator, a career criminal, is reticent about striking a residence if its occupants are likely to be armed. However, if a criminal knows that a house is unarmed, the dangers are less and the pickings are easier. It is as if the sheep have no guard dogs.</P><P>     In the short run, we can do little about the presence of guns in our town, neighborhood or city. About the only thing we can do is make sure that our houses contain no weapons. I am not at all sure that people would disarm themselves if they realized that by going unarmed, and letting everyone know it, they were making life easier for criminals. Yet this is exactly what conventional gun control seeks to do. The consequences are clear if my ranch analogy holds.</P><P>     Ask yourself, would I like to have this sign and display it on my house? If you would, let me know; I would be happy to sell you one and donate the proceeds to charity. But if not, perhaps you agree with the economic argument that guns in the hands of honest citizens raise the costs of crime and make crime less likely.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P> EACH summer I'm reminded why John Steinbeck thought that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. This summer, the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) again hosted conferences for federal judges, seminars for environmental writers, bike trips, and research on environmental economics and policy.</P><P>       But I see changes in Montana. One is congestion and the new rich who've discovered the &quot;last best place.&quot; Also, new bureaucratic pathologies have arrived. A dramatic example is the Idaho Pole Superfund site in north Bozeman. Though many cities have Superfund sites - Denver and Salt Lake have three, Seattle has four - they are ripples in the economic ocean of a big city. In Bozeman, they are tidal waves.</P><P>     Professor Richard Stroup, my former colleague, and Sandra Goodman recently published a report on Superfund, EPA's effort to clean up toxic waste (&quot;Rights vs. Regulation; How to Reform Superfund&quot;). Their report includes a description of Bozeman's Idaho Pole facility and indicates that Idaho Pole exemplifies many Superfund sites where health risks are overstated and bureaucratic power enhanced. This is not an accident, for the EPA has strong incentives to push caution to dangerous levels.</P><P>     Twenty-five years ago, I worked in the woods and helped send some of the best and largest lodgepole pines to Idaho Pole. They treated these logs with chemicals to make long lasting wooden utility poles. At some point, a chemical used to treat these poles, pentachlorophenol (PCP), was spilled, leaving what the EPA says are potentially harmful concentrations. The EPA has tried to convince the public that the Idaho Pole site is a threat to the community.</P><P>     But the EPA is probably wrong. EPA calculations of the future risks posed by the Idaho Pole site, as at many other Superfund sites, rely upon shaky assumptions. The EPA assumed that Idaho Pole's property would become a residential trailer park within two years - even though Idaho Pole is profitable - and that residents would drill wells for drinking water even though Bozeman's municipal water supply is already there. The EPA also ignored information from its own Office of Toxic Substances indicating that the concentration of PCP in water decreases by half every 20 to 200 days. Risks that may exist will diminish significantly over time.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman see further problems with the EPA's risk assessments. In identifying Superfund sites, the EPA consistently assumes unlikely, risk-enhancing situations and ignores mitigating factors in their Superfund decisions. Such methodological errors undermine the agency's judgment and make the usefulness of its National Priorities List highly suspect. Yet the Superfund law severely limits the accused polluter's right to review EPA claims in court.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman do not discuss, but I find more disturbing, Superfund's apparent violations of the spirit of our constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws - laws that make past actions illegal and punishable. It forces firms to finance cleanups of perfectly legitimate activities when no actual harm has been demonstrated.</P><P>     If people were engaged in legal, productive activities and we later decide that cleanup is necessary, we the public should pay. It is not just or equitable to impose cleanup costs on someone whose responsibility is tangential and trivial. But with Superfund's joint and several liability, any involvement can lead to complete responsibility as EPA searches for deep pockets.</P><P>     To a political economist, these problems are predictable consequences of the EPA's incentives. The EPA is blamed when toxic waste harms people directly, but rarely criticized if its regulations harm people in hidden ways. For example, if a highly carcinogenic chemical leached into groundwater, and the EPA failed to act, there would be severe repercussions in Congress.</P><P>     The EPA takes this logic to the extreme, concocts its farfetched &quot;reasonable maximum exposures&quot; and uses them to guide action. Concurrently, the agency discounts the consequences of its cleanup mandates: disruption of local communities and increasing exposure to a chemical by site disturbance. The incentives are to overstate the risks of toxic waste and to discount the human and financial costs of cleaning up.</P><P>     Improving Superfund's environmental performance and reducing its ethical and economic costs requires fundamental reform. First, the EPA's farfetched risk assessments should be replaced by more sober science. Second, people should only be liable for past actions if real harms were wrongly imposed on other people. Even then, they should pay in rough proportion to their responsibility. And third, we should remove the near prohibition on accused polluters having their day in court to challenge EPA directives.</P><P>     Toxic chemicals are not romantic. They lack the appeal of parks or forests. But their lesson is applicable throughout environmental policy: Well-intended government programs often go awry. Successful environmental reform must heed the ecological insight that many actions have unintended consequences. It applies to political economy as well as biology. I explore this theme in future columns.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Before: SILBERMAN, WILLIAMS and GINSBURG, Circuit Judges.
<P>
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge, STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS.
<P>
STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:
<P>
While attending college, plaintiffs Ernest A. Tuckett III and
William Demps, Jr. also worked as &quot;testers&quot; for the
Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington. In December 1990,
both Tuckett and Demps, who are black, were paired with white
testers also employed by the Council. On successive days, the
two pairs of testers--equipped with fake credentials intended
to be comparable--sought employment referrals from BMC Marketing
Corporation, which runs an employment agency in the District of
Columbia. Both times the white tester received a referral and
the black tester did not; indeed, BMC allegedly refused even to
accept an application from one of the two black testers. On the
basis of these tests, the Council and the two black testers sued
BMC in federal district court, alleging that BMC has &quot;a pattern,
practice and policy of employment discrimination on the basis
of race&quot;. The plaintiffs asserted claims under two different
federal statutes--42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e--and
one local statute. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief
as well as damages of various sorts.
<P>
BMC moved to dismiss the complaint for want of standing. The district
court denied the motion but granted BMC leave to take an interlocutory
appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), 829 F.Supp. 402; we permitted
the appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part. While the Fair
Employment Council can maintain a portion of its suit, the individual
testers cannot.
<P>
I. The Individual Testers
<P>
A. Federal Claims
<P>
Neither of the federal statutes that they invoke gives the tester
plaintiffs a cause of action for damages, and they lack standing
to seek the other forms of relief requested.
<P>
1. Claims for Damages
<P>
a. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981
<P>
Section 1981 gives all citizens of the United States &quot;the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts
... as is enjoyed by white citizens&quot;, language that the Supreme
Court has interpreted to prohibit not only racially discriminatory
government interference with private contracting but also purely
private discrimination in contracts. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.
160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171-75, 109 S.Ct. 2363,
2369-72, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). The testers assert that BMC violated
their rights under this statute in two distinct ways: it deprived
them of the opportunity to enter into contracts with BMC for employment
referrals, and it deprived them of the opportunity to enter into
employment contracts on referral by BMC. In the context of this
case, however, neither assertion states a valid claim under Sec.
1981.
<P>
As for the first assertion, BMC denies that it enters into contracts
with the people who seek referrals from it. The plaintiffs respond
that this argument assumes factual matters that should be dealt
with in further proceedings. But even if BMC sometimes does enter
into contracts with job-seekers, the testers here made conscious
and material *1271 misrepresentations of fact by deceiving BMC
about their intentions and by presenting BMC with fictitious credentials.
Any resulting contracts between the tester plaintiffs and BMC
would have been voidable at BMC's option, as the plaintiffs appear
to recognize. See, e.g., Rest. (2d) of Contracts Sec. 164(1) (1981).
Even on the plaintiffs' argument, then, BMC did not deny the testers
the opportunity to enter into a contract that they could have
enforced.
<P>
Certainly the loss of the opportunity to enter into a void contract--i.e.,
a contract that neither party can enforce--is not an injury
<P>
cognizable under Sec. 1981, for a void contract is a legal nullity.
From the perspective of the party who obtains a contract through
misrepresentations, however, it is generally worse for the contract
to be voidable than for it to be void; in the absence of any kind
of ratification, a voidable contract simply gives the other party
an option. In any event, the rule that contracts obtained through
misrepresentations are merely voidable rather than void seems
designed entirely to protect the target of the misrepresentations.
We conclude, therefore, that the loss of the opportunity to enter
into a contract voidable at the other party's will is not cognizable
under Sec. 1981. Cf., e.g., Kawitt v. United States, 842 F.2d
951, 953 (7th Cir.1988) (job obtained by material misrepresentation
is not a property right on which constitutional suit may be founded).
<P>
The plaintiffs' second assertion fails because the testers concededly
had no interest in securing a job through BMC. Indeed, they had
promised the Council to refuse any offer of employment that they
received in conjunction with their testing activities. See Plaintiffs'
Rule 108(h) Statement of Genuine Factual Issues (Sept. 18, 1992)
at 17; Defendant Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss
and/or for Summary Judgment (June 23, 1992) tab 14 at 17. In depositions,
both of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they would have rejected
any job offer obtained through a referral from BMC. Plaintiffs'
Statement tab 20 at 92 (Tuckett); Snelling's Motion tab 16 at
233-34 (Demps). At most, then, BMC deprived the tester plaintiffs
of the opportunity to refuse to enter into an employment contract
with BMC's clients. This too is not an injury cognizable under
Sec. 1981.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages under Sec. 1981 arguably conflicts with decisions of the
Third and Eleventh Circuits, but the analysis in those decisions
is not directly on point. In Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership
Ass'n, 559 F.2d 894 (3d Cir.1977), overruled on other grounds
by Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1985), aff'd,
482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987), the Third
Circuit held that fair-housing testers had standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1982, a parallel provision that guarantees
all citizens &quot;the same right, in every State and Territory,
as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof&quot; to engage in a variety
of transactions involving property. Meyers, however, addressed
exclusively the proposition that a plaintiff's standing is not
defeated by the fact that he subjected himself to legal injury
solely for the purpose of determining whether his rights would
be violated, with the intent to bring suit if they were. Cf.,
e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1219-20,
18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 79 S.Ct.
178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (per curiam). Meyers did not address
whether the testers had in fact suffered any legal injury within
the meaning of Secs. 1981 or 1982. At most, it simply assumed
that the testers had a cause of action under those provisions,
and it may not have considered the issue at all. See Meyers, 559
F.2d at 898.
<P>
Watts v. Boyd Properties, 758 F.2d 1482 (11th Cir.1985), is similarly
unpersuasive. Though the Eleventh Circuit did indicate that fair-housing
testers have a cause of action under Sec. 1982 (and hence, presumably,
under Sec. 1981), it rested this view chiefly on Meyers.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs lack a cause of action
under Sec. 1981 is perfectly consistent with Havens Realty Corp.
v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982),
which held that black fair-housing testers had standing to sue
over alleged violations of Sec. 804(d) of the Fair Housing Act
of 1968. There, Congress had *1272 clearly conferred a cause of
action on the testers; Sec. 804(d) made it unlawful &quot;[t]o
represent to any person because of race ... that any dwelling
is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling
is in fact so available&quot;, and Sec. 812 provided that &quot;[t]he
rights granted by section[ ] ... 804 ... may be enforced by civil
actions in appropriate United States district courts&quot;. See42
U.S.C. Secs. 3604(d), 3612(a). Under these statutory provisions,
it did not matter that the testers merely posed as potential renters
or purchasers; regardless of their intentions, the statute gave
them &quot;an enforceable right to truthfulinformation concerning
the availability of housing&quot;. Havens, 455 U.S.
<P>
at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121 (emphasis added). The question for
theHavens Court, then, was simply whether Congress could constitutionally
confer such a cause of action--i.e., whether the denial of truthful
information to testers caused them any &quot;injury in fact&quot;.
The Court's answer to this constitutional question has no bearing
on the proper interpretation of Sec. 1981.
<P>
b. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(b)
<P>
The tester plaintiffs also sought damages under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII declares that &quot;[i]t shall
be an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to
fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate
against, any individual because of his race&quot;. 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-2(b). After exhausting certain administrative remedies (as
the plaintiffs have done), &quot;a person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by any such practice may sue the offending employment agency in
court. Id. Sec. 2000e-5(b), (c), (f)(1). This statutory scheme
is much more analogous than Sec. 1981 to the provisions of the
Fair Housing Act that were at issue in Havens. (FN1) For our purposes,
however, the available remedies are critically different.
<P>
Had the tester plaintiff in Havens proved her claims, the district
court could have awarded her damages. See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3612(b);
cf. United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 932-33 (7th Cir.1992).
At the time of the alleged discrimination against the testers
here, however, only equitable remedies were available under Title
VII. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g); see also United States v. Burke,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873-74, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992)
(contrasting &quot;the circumscribed remedies available under
Title VII&quot; with the remedies available under the Fair Housing
Act). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the remedies available
under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981a, but the new remedial
provisions cannot be applied to conduct occurring before the enactment
of the 1991 statute. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, --- U.S. ----,
114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).
<P>
2. Claims for Prospective Relief
<P>
Since the tester plaintiffs have no cause of action for damages
under either Sec. 1981 or Title VII, their federal claims reduce
to their request for injunctive or declaratory relief. Yet under
City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75
L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), they lack standing to seek such prospective
relief, for they have not made sufficient allegations that they
are threatened with any future illegality.
<P>
The plaintiff in Lyons alleged that Los Angeles police, without
provocation, had subjected him to a chokehold that had knocked
him unconscious and injured his larynx. In addition to damages,
he sought an injunction barring the police from applying such
chokeholds in the future. But the Supreme Court held that he had
no standing to seek injunctive relief. Despite his allegations
of past injury, his standing to seek the injunction &quot;depended
on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use
of the chokeholds by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct.
at 1667 (emphasis added). While conceding the possibility that
&quot;there will be certain instances *1273 in which strangleholds
will be illegally applied and injury ... unconstitutionally inflicted
upon the victim&quot;, the Court thought it &quot;no more than
speculation to assert ... that Lyons himself will again be involved
in one of those unfortunate instances&quot;. Id. at 108, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668. In short, while Lyons could maintain a suit for damages,
he could not maintain his suit for an injunction because he &quot;has
made no showing that he is realistically threatened by a repetition
of his experience&quot;. Id. at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The same
rationale, we have observed, would also have kept him from bringing
a suit for declaratory relief. Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902,
911 (D.C.Cir.1987); see also, e.g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S.
103, 108-10, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959-61, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); City
of Houston v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Dev't, 24 F.3d
1421, 1429 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1994).
<P>
Here, the tester plaintiffs made several different references
to future injury in their complaint. In general, however, these
future injuries spring entirely from BMC's past conduct. See,
e.g., Second Amended Complaint p 44 (suggesting that testers will
continue to feel embarrassment and humiliation over their treatment
during the tests); id. p 7. To pursue an injunction or a declaratory
judgment, the tester plaintiffs must allege a likelihood of future
violations of their rights by BMC, not simply future effects from
past violations. Lyons is directly on point, for the Court there
denied standing despite the plaintiff's allegation that he continued
to fear that he would suffer a fatal chokehold in a future encounter
with the police. &quot;The emotional consequences of a prior act&quot;,
the Court observed, &quot;simply are not a sufficient basis for
an injunction absent a real and immediate threat of future injury
by the defendant.&quot; Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n. 8, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668 n. 8.
<P>
Only once in their complaint do the tester plaintiffs even come
close to alleging that they will suffer any future illegality
at BMC's hands. In their Sec. 1981 count (though not in their
Title VII count), they assert that &quot;[u]nless restrained by
this Court, defendants will continue to deny, on the basis of
race, said plaintiffs and third parties who may be unaware of
the defendants' discriminatory conduct[ ] the right to make and
enforce contracts for employment.&quot; Second Amended Complaint
p 50. The reference to third parties, of course, does not help
the tester plaintiffs establish standing; to satisfy the requirements
of Article III, they must allege that they themselves are likely
to suffer future injury. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108-09, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668-69. Nonetheless, the quoted passage constitutes the only
conceivable support for the plaintiffs' argument that the complaint
contains the requisite claims of future injuries, which they sort
into two distinct types.
<P>
First, the plaintiffs assert standing on the basis of &quot;BMC's
continuing failure to refer Mr. Demps or Mr. Tuckett for employment
on account of their race&quot;. Appellees' Brief at 36. This allegation,
however, does the tester plaintiffs no good; as we explained above,
see supra part I.A.1.a., BMC's refusal to act on the testers'
applications does not violate Sec. 1981. And even if we import
the same allegation into the plaintiffs' Title VII count, the
facts as alleged by the plaintiffs would not make out a continuing
violation of Title VII either. The tester plaintiffs sought referrals
from BMC solely on the basis of their fictitious credentials and
their misrepresentations about their desire for jobs. Now that
BMC is aware of the deception, it surely has no duty to continue
to consider the testers for employment referrals.
<P>
The plaintiffs also claim that their complaint, fairly read, raises
&quot;the possibility that as people entering the job market or
as testers they will in the future seek job referrals from BMC&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 36. But nowhere does the complaint assert
that the tester plaintiffs are likely ever to return to BMC seeking
employment referrals, let alone that they will do so at any point
&quot;in the reasonably near future&quot;. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 108, 103 S.Ct. at 1668-69; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2138, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)
(rejecting standing for want of sufficiently &quot;imminent&quot;
future injury). Even now, in fact, the plaintiffs do not suggest
that there is any likelihood that the two testers will re-initiate
contact with BMC; they refer only to the &quot;possibility&quot;
of this event. That *1274 possibility seems remote indeed. Their
usefulness as testers is minimal because they are now known to
BMC, and indeed it does not appear from the materials before us
that they are still employed as testers at all. Their adversarial
relationship with BMC, moreover, as well as their established
record as deceivers, make it highly implausible that they would
ever return as bona fide job seekers. Cf.United Transp. Union
v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 913 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1989) (court may discredit
incredible allegations).
<P>
The district court overlooked these problems on the theory that
the plaintiffs themselves control whether they re-initiate contact
with BMC. Mem.Op. at 7. But this fact does not excuse the plaintiffs
from alleging that they plan to do so. To the contrary, the Supreme
Court has categorically rejected the proposition that a plaintiff
seeking prospective relief need assert a threat of imminent future
injury &quot;only when the alleged harm depends upon 'the affirmative
actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control' &quot;.
See Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at
2139 n. 2.
<P>
In any event, the plaintiffs simply do not control whether they
will suffer any future injury, for they do not control whether
BMC would discriminate against them in any future encounter. Suppose
we could assume that the tester plaintiffs are likely to return
to BMC in the reasonably near future. Indeed, for the sake of
their Sec. 1981 claim (and possibly even their Title VII claim,
see supra at 6 n. 1), suppose we could assume that they will do
so as bona fide candidates for employment rather than as testers.
They would still appear to be in much the same position as the
plaintiff in Lyons: while he presumably could have initiated another
encounter with the Los Angeles police, he could not control whether
he would be subjected to a second illegal chokehold.
<P>
In Lyons, the Supreme Court stated that unless the plaintiff could
allege that Los Angeles ordered or authorized its police officers
to apply unprovoked chokeholds, he could &quot;establish an actual
controversy in this case&quot; only by &quot;mak[ing] the incredible
assertion ... that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke
any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter&quot;.
Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. at 1667. This formulation
may be hyperbolic; indeed, Lyons itself said that the plaintiff's
standing to seek an injunction &quot;depended on whether he was
likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds
by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct. at 1667 (emphasis
added); see also International Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied
Craftsmen v. Meese, 761 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C.Cir.1985) (adopting
&quot;fairly probable&quot; as standard). But see Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 1724-25, 109 L.Ed.2d
135 (1990) (indicating that plaintiff whose standing rests on
threat of future injury must show that this injury is &quot;certainly
impending&quot;); Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2,
112 S.Ct. at 2139 n. 2 (same); Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Espy,
23 F.3d 496, 500-01 (D.C.Cir.1994), (same). Whatever the exact
standard for judging the likelihood of future injury, however,
the tester plaintiffs here have said nothing to indicate that
future violation of their rights is even remotely probable. Indeed,
besides its oblique statement that BMC's treatment of the testers
reflects &quot;a pattern, practice and policy of employment discrimination
on the basis of race&quot;, the complaint does not even address
the likelihood that BMC may discriminate against the individual
plaintiffs in the future.
<P>
For all these reasons, the facts as alleged in the complaint do
not come close to indicating that either tester &quot;will again
be subjected to the alleged illegality&quot;. See Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The tester plaintiffs therefore lack
standing to seek prospective relief.
<P>
B. The Possibility of Amendment
<P>
As a fallback position, the plaintiffs claim that &quot;the appropriate
course is to remand to the District Court to permit plaintiffs
an opportunity to amend and supplement their Complaint&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 37 n. 26. In Havens, which involved a challenge
to a realty company's alleged practice of steering white customers
to white areas and black customers to black areas, the Supreme
Court followed this course with respect to two plaintiffs who
alleged that the company's actions *1275 had deprived them of
the benefits of living in an integrated community. Though the
complaint simply stated that these plaintiffs were &quot;residents
of the City of Richmond or Henrico County&quot;, the Court said
they would have standing only if they lived in neighborhoods where
the company's actions had &quot;an appreciable effect&quot;. See
Havens, 455 U.S. at 376-77, 102 S.Ct. at 1122-24. Because the
complaint was not sufficiently specific about where they lived,
it was &quot;impossible to say&quot; whether its factual allegations,
if proved, would demonstrate the requisite injury. Id. at 378,
102 S.Ct. at 1124. Citing Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court therefore remanded with instructions for
the district court to give the plaintiffs &quot;an opportunity
to make more definite the allegations of the complaint&quot;.
Id.
<P>
The Court's later decisions clarify the reasoning behind this
disposition.
<P>
Havens came to the Court on the defendant's motion to dismiss
the case on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(b). Though courts
addressing such motions usually must &quot;presume[ ] that general
allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to
support the claim&quot;, Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed'n, 497
U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3189, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), Havens
establishes that such a presumption is unwarranted when the allegations
are too general. Even then, however, the contrary presumption
may be inappropriate; faced with such allegations, courts ruling
on a Rule 12(b) motion often should not assume that the claim
is invalid without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to make
more specific claims. (FN2)
<P>
The case before us is quite different. We do not confront a complaint
whose allegations are so general that we cannot tell whether,
if proved, they would demonstrate injury in fact. To the contrary,
the allegations plainly are not sufficient to support standing,
for they simply do not deal with the likelihood of any future
injury to the plaintiff testers. What is necessary, then, is not
the &quot;more definite statement&quot; contemplated by Rule 12(e),
but an amendment adding allegations that the present complaint
does not even touch upon. Rule 15(a) makes clear that the plaintiffs
have no automatic right to add those allegations.
<P>
On the other hand, district courts do have the discretion to permit
such amendments when considering a motion to dismiss for want
of standing. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197,
2206-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); see also, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors
v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 113 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 1601,
1614 n. 25, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.
727, 736 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1367 n. 8, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972);
Newark Branch, NAACP v. Town of Harrison, 907 F.2d 1408, 1416-17
(3d Cir.1990). Here, the district court did not consider whether
to exercise this discretion, because it erroneously believed that
no amendment was necessary. Accordingly, while we vacate the district
court's denial of BMC's motion to dismiss the individual testers'
suit, we do not order it to grant that motion; instead, we remand
the case for the district court to exercise its sound discretion
over whether to permit amendment. We see no reason why plaintiffs
who win in the district court should automatically be in a worse
position than plaintiffs whose allegations of standing have been
rightly found defective by the district court.
<P>
Of course, a plaintiff's successful effort to persuade a trial
court to take an erroneous view of the law may yield different
equities from those prevailing in the absence of such an effort.
In some circumstances, it might well be an abuse of discretion
for the district court to permit plaintiffs to add new allegations
to a complaint after their adversaries have been forced to spend
substantial time and effort litigating the adequacy of the old
allegations. Cf. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 897,
110 S.Ct. at 3193 (&quot;[A] *1276 litigant's failure to buttress
its position because of confidence in the strength of that position
is always indulged at the litigant's own risk.&quot;). But in
any event, the matter of amendment is in the first instance for
the district court.
<P>
C. Pendent Claims under District of Columbia Law
<P>
The tester plaintiffs have also asserted a cause of action under
the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act. That statute contains
a provision similar to Sec. 2000e-2(b), see D.C.Code Sec. 1-2512(a)(2),
and it goes further than the original Title VII by authorizing
suits for damages as well as for equitable relief, see id. Sec.
1-2556. But the testers were able to bring their claim under this
statute to federal court only because it was pendent to their
federal claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(a). As a result, even
if the plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages under D.C.
law, it will be within the district court's discretion whether
or not to dismiss this claim if it dismisses both their federal
claims. See id. Sec. 1367(c)(3); cf. Clifton Terrace Assocs. v.
United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d 714, 723 (D.C.Cir.1991).
<P>
II. The Fair Employment Council
<P>
The other plaintiff in this action, the Fair Employment Council
of Greater Washington, fares better under our analysis. The Council
does not claim standing on behalf of any members; in fact, it
is not a membership organization. Cf. Hunt v. Washington State
Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S.
<P>
333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). It claims
instead that BMC's allegedly discriminatory actions have caused
it injury in its own right.
<P>
We agree that the Council has alleged &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III. And, though
the Council is suing BMC over alleged violations of statutory
rights enjoyed by third parties, we conclude that Congress did
give the Council a cause of action under Title VII. We also conclude,
however, that the Council has no cause of action under Sec. 1981.
<P>
A. Article III Standing
<P>
Like the fair-housing organization that was one of the plaintiffs
in Havens, the Council has a broad goal of promoting equal opportunity
independent of merely seeking more enforcement of the civil rights
laws. Second Amended Complaint p 5. Its testing program is but
one means toward this goal; the Council also conducts &quot;community
outreach and public education, counseling, and research projects&quot;.
Declaration of Charles W. Jackson p 8 (Sept. 18, 1992). The complaint
alleges that BMC's discriminatory actions have interfered with
these efforts and programs and have also required the Council
to expend resources to counteract BMC's alleged discrimination.
Second Amended Complaint pp 45, 58, 60.
<P>
These allegations closely track the claims that the Supreme Court
found sufficient in Havens. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct.
at 1124-25. Fairly read, they indicate that BMC's alleged pattern
of discrimination--evidenced by the alleged treatment of the testers--has
made the Council's overall task more difficult. Discrimination
by BMC, for instance, might increase the number of people in need
of counseling; similarly, to the extent that BMC's actions have
made it harder for minorities to find jobs in greater Washington,
they may have reduced the effectiveness of any given level of
outreach efforts. If discriminatory actions taken by BMC have
&quot;perceptibly impaired&quot; the Council's programs, &quot;there
can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in
fact&quot;. Id.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, however, we explicitly reject the
Council's suggestion that the mere expense of testing BMC constitutes
&quot;injury in fact&quot; fairly traceable to BMC's conduct.
The diversion of resources to testing might well harm the Council's
other programs, for money spent on testing is money that is not
spent on other things. But this particular harm is self-inflicted;
it results not from any actions taken by BMC, but rather from
the Council's own budgetary choices. Indeed, it is not really
a harm at all; assuming that BMC's actions did not have any other
effect on the Council's programs independent of its efforts to
increase legal pressure *1277 on possible open housing violators,
the Council and its programs would have been totally unaffected
if it had simply refrained from making the re-allocation. One
can hardly say that BMC has injured the Council merely because
the Council has decided that its money would be better spent by
testing BMC than by counseling or researching. (FN3)
<P>
We disagree with the Seventh Circuit that Havens would support
such a purely self-referential injury. In Village of Bellwood
v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th Cir.1990), the court concluded
that even when a fair-housing organization's other activities
had not been impaired by the defendant's discriminatory practices,
&quot;the only injury which need be shown ... is deflection of
the agency's time and money from counseling to legal efforts directed
against discrimination.&quot; Id. at 1526. By this logic, the
time and money that plaintiffs spend in bringing suit against
a defendant would itself constitute a sufficient &quot;injury
in fact&quot;, a circular position that would effectively abolish
the requirement altogether. Indeed, an organization devoted exclusively
to advancing more rigorous enforcement of selected laws could
secure standing simply by showing that one alleged illegality
had &quot;deflected&quot; it from pursuit of another, contrary
to such decisions as Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop
the War, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Havens
did not so hold. The Court there did not base standing on the
diversion of resources from one program to another, but rather
on the alleged injury that the defendants' actions themselves
had inflicted upon the organization's programs. To be sure, the
Court did mention the &quot;drain on the organization's resources&quot;.
Yet this drain apparently sprang from the organization's need
to &quot;counteract&quot; the defendants' assertedly illegal practices,
and thus was simply another manifestation of the injury that those
practices had inflicted upon &quot;the organization's noneconomic
interest in encouraging open housing&quot;, an interest that is
quite intelligible apart from the allied efforts at increasing
legal pressure on civil-rights violators. See Havens, 455 U.S.
at 379 &amp; n. 20, 102 S.Ct. at 1124 &amp; n. 20; cf. Spann v.
Colonial Village, 899 F.2d 24, 27-29 (D.C.Cir.1990) (finding standing
because in order to offset defendant's allegedly discriminatory
advertisements, plaintiff organization had to spend more on its
educational and counseling efforts).
<P>
A corollary of our conclusion is that the Council's standing stems
from BMC's actions against bona fide employment candidates, not
from BMC's actions against the testers. The Council has adequately
alleged that BMC has a pattern or practice of discrimination,
and its treatment of the testers may be some evidence of such
a pattern. Any harm to the Council's programs, however, flows
from BMC's refusal to refer genuine job-seekers for employment.
As this case proceeds, the Council will have to provide support
for its claim that BMC's alleged discrimination has &quot;perceptibly
impaired&quot; its programs.
<P>
B. Cause of Action
<P>
Though the Council has adequately alleged an &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to meet the requirements of Article III, this does
not necessarily mean that Congress has conferred a cause of action
upon it. BMC has done nothing to impair the Council's own right
to make contracts, nor is the Council even capable of seeking
an employment referral. Instead, the Council's asserted injuries
flow from BMC's alleged violations of other people's rights under
Sec. 1981 and Title VII. This fact triggers concerns about an
aspect of the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing: ordinarily,
a plaintiff &quot;must assert his own legal interests, rather
than those of third parties&quot;. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608.
<P>
*1278 To phrase the principle this way, however, is to beg the
question. If Congress has given the Council a cause of action
to redress the injuries that it is suffering as a result of BMC's
alleged discrimination against candidates for referrals, then
the Council is indeed suing to protect its own &quot;legal interests&quot;.
Cf., e.g., Smith v. City of Cleveland Heights, 760 F.2d 720, 724
(6th Cir.1985). A more precise statement of the principle, then,
is that a statute ordinarily will not be interpreted to confer
causes of action upon people whose only injuries derive from the
violation of others' rights under the statute.
<P>
When the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing to raise statutory
claims are understood in this way--as a set of presumptions that
courts use in determining whether the statutes in question confer
a cause of action upon the plaintiff, see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 500-01, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 861 F.2d 277, 283 (D.C.Cir.1988)--the &quot;prudential&quot;
label seems a misnomer. These &quot;prudential&quot; rules are
simply canons of statutory interpretation, and Congress is free
to override the normal presumptions. In Havens, for instance,
the Supreme Court noted that Congress intended standing to sue
under Sec. 812 of the Fair Housing Act to extend to the full reach
permitted by the Constitution, and concluded that &quot;the courts
accordingly lack the authority to create prudential barriers to
standing in suits brought under that section&quot;. Havens, 455
U.S. at 372, 102 S.Ct. at 1120; accord Warth, 422 U.S. at 501,
95 S.Ct. at 2206-07. Statutes of this sort confer a cause of action
upon everyone who meets the Article III requirements--that is,
anyone &quot;genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone's
... rights&quot; under the statute. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 103 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 1609 n. 9.
<P>
Our case law establishes that Title VII is such a statute. Congress
specifically permitted any &quot;person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by an unlawful employment practice to file suit (after exhausting
certain other potential avenues of relief). See 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-5(f)(1). This language, we have held, opens the courts to
&quot;anyone who satisfies the constitutional requirements&quot;.
Gray v. Greyhound Lines, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C.Cir.1976); see
also Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205,
209, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-67, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972) (citing with
approval the Third Circuit's decision to the same effect). Accordingly,
if the Council can back up its allegations of Article III standing
with actual proof, it has a cause of action under Title VII.
<P>
Section 1981 is a different matter. A footnote in Gray indicated
that there too standing extended to the full extent permissible
under Article III. Gray, 545 F.2d at 176 n. 18. This conclusion,
however, rested on an unsustainable assumption that the Supreme
Court, in citing a snippet of Title VII's legislative history
to the effect that the remedies available under Title VII were
&quot;co-extensive&quot; with an individual's right to sue under
Sec. 1981, meant that Congress had identically resolved prudential
standing issues under the two statutes. See Johnson v. Railway
Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1719-20, 44
L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In fact, as the Supreme Court made clear,
the committee's statement that Title VII and Sec. 1981 were &quot;co-extensive&quot;
simply meant that the two statutes co-existed, with the result
that Title VII did not pre-empt whatever rights an individual
might enjoy under Sec. 1981. Id.
<P>
Moreover, Gray 's view of Sec. 1981 flatly conflicts with the
Supreme Court's holding in Warth v. Seldin. There, an organization
whose members included residents of the town of Penfield, New
York, complained that the town's zoning ordinance excluded people
of low and moderate income in violation of those people's rights
under Sec. 1981. This exclusion, in turn, injured the organization's
members by depriving them of the benefits of living in an integrated
community. Such an injury satisfies the constitutional requirements,
and the Court accordingly has recognized it as a basis for standing
in suits under the Fair Housing Act (which confers standing to
the full extent permitted by Article III). See Trafficante, 409
U.S. at 208-10, 93 S.Ct. at 366-67. In Warth, however, the Court
held that Sec. 1981 was critically different *1279 from the Fair
Housing Act in this respect. Invoking the &quot;prudential&quot;
rule against allowing litigants &quot;to raise putative rights
of third parties&quot;, it accordingly barred the organization's
suit. Warth, 422 U.S. at 512-14, 93 S.Ct. at 2212-13.
<P>
As one would expect, then, other circuits--including our own--have
rejected Gray 's view of Sec. 1981. In Mackey v. Nationwide Insurance
Companies, 724 F.2d 419 (4th Cir.1984), an insurance agent attempted
to challenge his former employer's alleged practice of refusing
to underwrite risks in predominantly black neighborhoods. The
agent claimed that this practice had forced him to forgo the money
that he could have earned by selling policies in these areas.
But while Congress could constitutionally have conferred a cause
of action upon the agent to redress this &quot;injury in fact&quot;,
the court held that Sec. 1981 did not do so. Distinguishing Sec.
1981 from the Fair Housing Act, the court decided that standing
under Sec. 1981 is restricted to &quot;the direct victims of the
alleged discriminatory practice&quot;, at least as long as there
is no impediment to suits by those victims. Id. at 422.
<P>
We too have now explicitly embraced Mackey rather than Gray. In
Clifton Terrace Associates v. United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d
714 (D.C.Cir.1991), the owner of a low-income housing complex
sued the Otis Elevator Company and its corporate parent for refusing
to negotiate a service contract for the elevators in the complex,
allegedly because the residents of the complex were overwhelmingly
black. The owner plainly had suffered &quot;injury in fact&quot;
as a result of this refusal, for its elevators were deteriorating;
indeed, the city government had taken action against it for violating
its duties as a landlord. Accordingly, we dealt with the owner's
Fair Housing Act claims on the merits. But we accorded a different
treatment to the owner's claims under Sec. 1981. Concluding that
&quot;the direct victims of the alleged discrimination are the
residents of Clifton Terrace&quot; rather than the owner, we invoked
Mackey to hold that the owner could not sue under Sec. 1981. Id.
at 721. (FN4) Accordingly, our law is now in accord with that
of the Supreme Court and other circuits in concluding that Sec.
1981 does not confer a cause of action on persons whose injuries
derive only from the violation of others' rights.
<P>
In arguing that the &quot;prudential&quot; barriers to standing
nonetheless do not preclude its particular suit, the Council cites
Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water District, 601 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1979).
Yet that case does not get it very far. Des Vergnes held simply
that Sec. 1981 confers an implied right of action &quot;against
any other person who, with a racially discriminatory intent, interferes
with [the plaintiff's] right to make contracts with nonwhites&quot;;
by the same token, the statute confers an implied right of action
&quot;against any other person who, with a racially discriminatory
intent, injures [the plaintiff] because he made contracts with
nonwhites&quot;. Id. at 14; see also Winston v. Lear-Siegler,
Inc., 558 F.2d 1266, 1270 (6th Cir.1977); DeMatteis v. Eastman
Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 312, modified, 520 F.2d 409 (2d Cir.1975);
cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct.
400, 404-05, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (reaching parallel result under
Sec. 1982). Implicit *1280 in Sec. 1981, these cases declare,
is a cause of action protecting people from private retaliation
for refusing to violate other people's rights under Sec. 1981,
or for exercising their own Sec. 1981 rights. The present case
simply does not implicate this principle.
<P>
The normal presumption against reading a statute to authorize
&quot;derivative&quot; causes of action--that is, causes of action
to redress injuries that derive entirely from the violation of
someone else's rights under the statute--is subject to only one
exception that is even arguably relevant here. Courts sometimes
infer that the legislature intended to authorize such causes of
action when, in their absence, no one would be able to assert
the statutory rights that the legislature created. Because of
this inference, a litigant might have a cause of action even though
his injuries flow from the violation of other people's statutory
rights, at least if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) the litigant's interests are aligned with the other people's
interests, and (2) the other people are unable to bring suit in
their own right. See, e.g., Canfield Aviation v. National Transp.
Safety Bd., 854 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir.1988); Flittie v. Solem,
827 F.2d 276, 280 (8th Cir.1987); In re Merrill Lynch Relocation
Management, Inc., 812 F.2d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.1987).
<P>
But even assuming that the Council's interests are aligned with
those of the direct victims of BMC's alleged discrimination, the
obstacles to suit by those victims are not serious enough to warrant
the inference that Sec. 1981 confers a cause of action upon the
Council. To be sure, the people to whom BMC denies employment
referrals may not necessarily know why their applications were
unsuccessful, and so the possible victims of BMC's alleged discrimination
may not always know who they are. But the Council itself could
remedy much of the problem simply by publicizing the results of
its tests and offering litigation assistance to people who suspect
(on the basis of this new information) that BMC has discriminated
against them. In the present case, as in Warth v. Seldin, &quot;there
is no indication that [direct victims of discrimination by BMC]
are disabled from asserting their own right in a proper case.&quot;
Warth, 422 U.S. at 510, 95 S.Ct. at 2211. Certainly they do not
face anything like the practical obstacles confronting people
excluded from a jury for discriminatory reasons, whose rights
the Court has allowed a criminal defendant to assert. See Powers
v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 414-15, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1372-73, 113 L.Ed.2d
411 (1991) (describing the &quot;daunting&quot; barriers to suit
by an excluded juror); cf. Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d
1409, 1416 (4th Cir.1983) (hypothesizing preemptive discrimination
that could never be identified with any individual victims).
<P>
The Third Circuit has perceived &quot;seemingly inconsistent strains&quot;
in the Supreme Court's treatment of whether &quot;the 'obstacle'
factor&quot; is an essential prerequisite to third-party standing,
Amato v. Wilentz, 952 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir.1991), and has resorted
to a &quot;more flexible balancing approach&quot; in an effort
to make sense of the Court's jurisprudence. Id. at 749-50 &amp;
n. 8. But we think the cases can in fact be reconciled.
<P>
Apart from cases involving &quot;the 'obstacle' factor&quot;,
the Court generally has
<P>
allowed a litigant to assert the rights of a third party &quot;only
when the third party's rights protect that party's relationship
with the litigant&quot;. Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809
F.2d 794, 809 (D.C.Cir.1987). (FN5) In the lion's share of these
cases, the litigant seeks to challenge direct restrictions on
its own activities on the ground that enforcement of the restrictions
against it would dilute or abrogate the rights of third parties.
As the Court has summed up its jurisprudence, &quot;When ... enforcement
of a restriction against the litigant prevents a *1281. third
party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically
a contractual relationship), to which relationship the third party
has a legal entitlement (typically a constitutional entitlement),
third-party standing has been held to exist.&quot; United States
Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720, 110 S.Ct. 1428,
1431, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); see also Warth, 422 U.S. at 510,
95 S.Ct. at 2211. For example, the Court has allowed beer vendors
to assert the equal-protection rights of their potential customers
in challenging a prohibition on the sale of beer to young males,
Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195, 97 S.Ct. 451, 455, 50 L.Ed.2d
397 (1976); distributors of contraceptive devices to assert the
privacy rights of contraceptive purchasers in challenging restrictions
on the distributors, Carey v. Population Servs. International,
431 U.S. 678, 682-84, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2014-16, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977);
and booksellers to assert the First Amendment rights of bookbuyers
in challenging the prohibition of certain commercial displays,
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 392-93,
108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988). Less frequently,
the Court has allowed litigants to assert third parties' rights
in challenging restrictions that do not operate directly on the
litigants themselves, but that nonetheless allegedly disrupt a
special relationship--protected by the rights in question--between
the litigants and the third parties. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society
of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (allowing
military academy and parochial school to assert constitutional
rights of students and parents in challenging state law requiring
parents to send their children to government school); see also
Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617,
623-24 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 2651-52 n. 3, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989)
(allowing lawyers to challenge federal forfeiture laws that allegedly
violate their clients' Sixth Amendment right to counsel); Singleton
v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-18 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2873-76
&amp; n. 7, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (plurality opinion) (allowing
abortion-performing doctors to complain that restrictions on Medicaid
payments for abortion violate the constitutional rights of women
seeking abortions). See generally National Cottonseed Products
Ass'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 489-92 &amp; n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1987).
<P>
Whatever the precise limits of these cases, they offer no help
to the Council. The Council certainly faces no direct restriction
on its own activities, and the Sec. 1981 rights of people who
seek referrals from BMC are unrelated to any special relationship
between those people and the Council. Under Warth v. Seldin, the
Council therefore cannot bring suit to complain about the violation
of those people's Sec. 1981 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 514
n. 22, 95 S.Ct. at 2213 n. 22.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
To sum up, the Council lacks a cause of action under Sec. 1981.
It can proceed with its Title VII claim, but it has a cause of
action only to the extent that the effects of BMC's discrimination
have perceptibly impaired its programs. As for the individual
testers, they have not stated a cause of action under Sec. 1981,
nor have they established standing to seek the only form of relief
that might be available to them under Title VII.
<P>
We remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
<P>
So ordered.
<P>
FN1. BMC still argues that people who lack a bona fide interest
in employment--such as testers--lack any cause of action under
Sec. 2000e-2(b).
<P>
The plaintiffs, supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission as amicus curiae, dispute this reading of the statute.
But because we agree with BMC's alternative argument that the
tester plaintiffs cannot recover damages under Title VII and have
no standing to seek the other relief that they request, we need
not address the issue.
<P>
FN2. The rules become less forgiving as litigation moves along.
When a court confronts a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment,
&quot;[i]t will not do to 'presume' the missing facts&quot;. National
Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 889, 110 S.Ct. at 3189. By the
same token, after the district court has held its summary-judgment
hearing, plaintiffs certainly cannot assume that the court will
permit them to supply any requisite averments through supplemental
affidavits. See id. at 894-98, 110 S.Ct. at 3191-94.
<P>
FN3. For the same reason, we reject the district court's theory
that the money that the Council spent on the second test (if not
the money that it spent on the first one) gave it &quot;a constitutionally
cognizable injury&quot; because BMC's alleged discrimination against
the first set of testers &quot;could have been a factor&quot;
in the Council's decision to run the second test. Mem.Op. at 10-11.
BMC's treatment of the first set of testers did not impair any
of the Council's programs in any way, even though the pattern
of discrimination evidenced by such tests may have done so. The
Council simply decided that its limited resources would be better
spent on testing BMC again than on testing a different agency
or on pursuing its other programs.
<P>
FN4. This conclusion, although not our embrace of Mackey, seems
to be in tension with Gersman v. Group Health Association, 931
F.2d 1565 (D.C.Cir.1991), vacated on other grounds, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 960, 117 L.Ed.2d 127 (1992), reinstated, 975 F.2d 886,
900 (D.C.Cir.1992). That case also involved a claim that the defendant
had refused to contract with one person (&quot;A &quot;) because
of a discriminatory animus against someone else (&quot;B &quot;).
But where Clifton Terrace held that A lacked standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 because any such suit would be an attempt to assert
B 's rights under the statute, Gersman took the opposite view.
Reasoning that Sec. 1981 protects the right to make contracts,
we held that B lacked standing because it was A--not B--with whom
the defendant allegedly was refusing to contract. See id. at 1567,
1569. Cf., e.g., Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111,
114 (5th Cir.1986) (recognizing cause of action under Sec. 1981
where employer allegedly fired plaintiff because her husband was
not white); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d
888, 890 (11th Cir.1986) (similar, where company allegedly refused
to hire plaintiff because of his wife's race); Fiedler v. Marumsco
Christian School, 631 F.2d 1144, 1149 (4th Cir.1980) (recognizing
cause of action under Sec. 1981 where white students alleged that
private school had expelled them for associating with blacks);
see also Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1250 (10th Cir.1992)
(holding that such causes of action under Sec. 1981 are &quot;clearly
established&quot; *1281_ FN5. The one notable exception to this
rule is inspired by First Amendment overbreadth analysis. In Secretary
of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956-57,
104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846-47, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984), for example, the
Court allowed a professional fundraiser to assert its clients'
First Amendment rights in challenging statutory limits on the
amount that charitable organizations can pay fundraisers. But
the Court specifically noted that &quot;outside the First Amendment
context&quot;, the fundraiser's standing would have been in doubt
because it had not shown that &quot;practical obstacles prevent
[the charities] from asserting rights&quot; on their own behalf.
Id. Even within the First Amendment realm, third-party standing
is by no means automatic. See, e.g., Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S.
312, 320, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 2338, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991).

Baden</P><P>&quot;THE Tragedy of the Commons&quot; appeared in Science magazine in 1968.</P><P> Though written by an ecologist, Garret Hardin, the article is a classic of political economy.</P><P>     Understanding the logic of this article should be a requirement of running for political office. It explains how and why we should expect waste when biological resources such as fisheries are openly available.</P><P>     The logic of the commons is straightforward. When no one has control over a resource, be it a parcel of ocean or a dormitory lounge, it tends to be poorly maintained, overused, or depleted. Without social or legal constraints, some people will maximize their personal advantages to the detriment of others. All users suffer, while benefits go to the exploiting individual. The incentive is for people to seek narrow personal advantages at the expense of the group and the resource. Few people act as wise stewards because others take a &quot;free ride&quot; on such actions, and rarely reciprocate.</P><P>     The North Pacific groundfish fishery within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska exemplifies a commons problem. Under the current open-access regime, there are only indirect controls on fishing. Short seasons and restrictions on fishing boats' size and horsepower are examples. These controls are extremely inefficient, have resulted in billions of dollars in excessive capital investment, and encourage chaotic races for fish that magnify the dangers of an already risky job.</P><P>     Experience suggests the problem may get worse under the current open-access system. Human, ecological and financial losses are likely to increase as the race for the fish becomes more frenzied. Brief, hurried seasons will increase pressure on fish populations and promote bycatch - the incidental capture of non-target species. Fortunately, unlike many of the world's fisheries, the basic stock remains healthy for now.</P><P>     A smart, honest and principled political leader could create huge safety, economic and ecological benefits by seriously addressing our fishery commons. Action need not be difficult, for we already have a solution. It is individual transferable quotas (ITQs) - a method of creating secure, transferable and reasonably well-defined property rights to fish. Here's how they work.</P><P>     First, peer reviewed research establishes the biologically sustainable yield of a fishery: how many fish can be taken without reducing the quantity or quality of the catch over time. Because these are estimates, not certainties, the allowable catch is always less than the theoretical maximum. Based on this estimated yield, a set of quotas is issued. Each entitles its holder to a fixed percentage of the total allowable catch.</P><P>     The initial distribution of rights has wealth implications. That's why parceling out quotas is the contentious feature of ITQ systems. Assigning quotas is one of the main factors delaying action by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the body overseeing the region's fisheries. The two principal alternatives for distributing quotas are a giveaway to existing fishermen, or an auction, perhaps one open to the public.</P><P>     With an ITQ system, quota holders have secure claims to a percentage of the total allowable catch. Only those with quotas may fish. Fishermen need not race to get their share. An extended fishing season means fewer days at sea for long hours or in dangerous weather. We'd also expect reductions in bycatch.</P><P>     Quotas give their owners incentives to conserve fish. As long as fisheries remain a commons, there are strong incentives to catch as many fish as quickly as possible. With ITQs, fishermen can increase the value of their quota and the size of their future catch, by allowing fish populations to increase. Such behavior has already been observed in the wreckfish, Southern bluefin tuna and various shellfish fisheries.</P><P>     With ownership, quotas can be bought and sold. Some fishermen will exit the industry. The more efficient fishermen and those who love fishing will buy or retain quotas and remain. Fewer ships and less equipment will be needed to catch a given amount of fish, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. And ITQs do not necessarily favor large operations over smaller ones.</P><P>     An increasing number of professional environmentalists, including well-respected economists with the Environmental Defense Fund, are showing an interest in ITQs. ITQs have the support of associations representing more than 80 percent of the seafood harvested in the North Pacific fisheries. They are the least painful way to downsize an industry made dangerous by short seasons and by federal subsidies that have promoted excessive investments in men, ships and equipment.</P><P>     The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has, overall, resisted consideration of ITQs, although its own staff concluded such a system would solve many of the industry's problems.</P><P>     Political entrepreneurs such as Greenpeace and the Alliance Against IFQs (IFQs being roughly similar to ITQs) have opposed ITQs because they fear the impact of such quotas on their private interests. Though we may sympathize with their concerns, political leadership is required to overcome their opposition to a valuable improvement in fishery management. Without it, more lives will be lost and politically sanctioned ecological plunder will continue. </P><P> _________</P><P>  John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<center><h2>The Bad and the Biased</h2>
<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."
<dd>For a full listing of the outlets which have carried our research recently, please turn to page <p>
<center><h3>We'll Decide Who's a Mean-Spirited Republican Award...</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"The Republican  jihad against the poor, the young, and the helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of Congress at the beginning of the year and  has spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and compassion in government."
<p>
<i>--New York Times</i> columnist and former NBC reporter Bob Herbert.
<p>
<center><h3>But It's Okay for Us to Hate Them Award (for Hypocritical Hatemongering)</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there."
<p>
-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Clarence Page, commenting on the Million Man March. Page has now written a nationally syndicated column attacking the MRC and <b>defending</b> that comment.
<p>
<center><h3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</h3></center>
<dd>"The scariest of all hobgoblins may be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' vacated by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<p>
-- <i>Time's</i> Jack E. White.
<p>
<center><h3> Republicans Make Us Sick Award</h3></center>
<dd>"Next week on ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, a series of reports on our environment which will tell you precisely what the new Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?"
<p>
-- a Peter Jennings promotional spot.
<p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes a Cut)</h3></center>
<dd>"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and the poor, to pay for that 'pouting sex kitten' mistress of their dreams -- tax cuts."
<p>
 -- U.S. News "reporter" Gerald Parshall giving the public "facts."
<p>
<center><h3>The Politics of Meaninglessness Award (for the Silliest Analysis)</h3></center>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings, with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?"
<p>
-- PBS' <i>To the Contrary</i> host Bonnie Erbe, equating gruesome skull-crushing partial-birth abortions to...eating veal. <p>

<center><h3>The Dumbest Quote of the Year</h3></center>
"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it."
<p>
-- NPR's Nina Totenberg, reacting to Senator Jesse Helms' inquiry about AIDS getting more funding than cancer or heart disease.

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community. 
<br>

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:
<dd>MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

Crawford, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division Director, to discuss the series and ask for the MRC's support; and <i>Noah</i> deserves our.
<dd>Filmed at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, <i>Second Noah</i> chronicles the hectic lives of Noah and Jesse Beckett. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is a former basketball coach and a best-selling novelist, while Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is the chief veterinarian at the Tampa Zoo. Mother and father to eight adopted children of various ethnic backgrounds, the Becketts also run an animal rescue operation, taking in abandoned or mistreated ani-mals. With love and compassion, Noah and Jesse face the daily challenges of raising eight children.
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> places great emphasis on personal responsibility and the family unit. The new series is filled with positive messages about honesty, understanding, and love. It respects religion and condemns racism. 
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> is a quality drama designed for family viewing. Since it has a rich and complex cast of characters to provide limitless possibilities for new stories, we hope <i>Second Noah</i> will be around to offer wholesome family entertainment for a long time to come.
<dd>The series airs on ABC, Monday nights at 8 p.m. EST.

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<center><h2>Commentary</h2>
<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<center><h2><i>Time</i> Writer Damns Those Conservatives</h2></center>
<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz. Within days of the official release, he participated in an interview on the 700 <i>Club</i> with Pat Robertson; a panel discussion on PBS's <i>McCuistion</i>; and interviews on radio stations WSPD in Ohio, KSL in Utah, WTIC in Connecticut, WBSN in Massachusetts, KLIF and WOAI in Texas, WJR in Michigan, WAIM in South Carolina, WTAL in Florida, KSN in South Dakota, WROK in Illinois, WWDB in Pennsylvania, as well as the G. <i>Gordon Liddy Show</i>, which airs across the country. Many, many more shows are lining up to get the message out.
<dd>Get the book that Arianna Huffington, Chair for the Center for Effective Compassion, calls "must reading for the GOP." R. Emmett Tyrrell, Editor in Chief of the <i>American Spectator</i> says <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, "shows that the press has been easier on Boy Clinton than Gennifer Flowers was." And nationally syndicated columnist and CNBC talk show host Cal Thomas exclaims, "No one is doing a better job of holding the press accountable for failing to live up to its high calling than the Media Research Center. In <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of lib-eralism than personal peccadilloes." 
<dd>We're offering <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> at a phenomenally low price for Members only. Please see ordering information <a href="#order">here</a>.

<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon

Baden</P><P>PRESIDENT Clinton is desperately looking for places to cut the budget. He even hints of hitting the Rural Electrification Administration. REA is an egregious example of government subsidies that enrich the wealthy while retarding environmentally beneficial innovation.</P><P>       REA was established in 1935 by President Roosevelt. It subsidized the delivery of electric power to remote rural locations at a time when few rural areas were electrified. Because the costs of stringing miles of power lines to isolated customers was so high, and alternative energy just developing, only 10 percent of farms had electricity.</P><P>     Lack of electricity contributed to low rural living standards. With collectivism in vogue, it appeared reasonable for the public to pay for power delivery. Taxpayers were to lose nothing: Federal subsidies were made at interest rates higher than the government's costs of borrowing. However, being a political promise, it was short-lived.</P><P>     Economies are like ecosystems in that you cannot do only one thing. REA had unintended, perverse consequences. Once these consequences are understood, the REA's appeal shrinks. But it has built a constituency and it won't quietly go away.</P><P>     First, few of the REA's subsidies actually benefit poor, rural areas. They did for a while, but do not now. Today, subsidies go to wealthy resort communities such as Vail, Aspen and Beaver Creek, Colo., and Hilton Head, S. C. They also go to wealthy suburbs of Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C. Over half the subsidies benefit Fortune 500 companies. The REA is subsidizing skiers, suburbanites, resorts and big businesses with middle-class taxes.</P><P>     Second, the REA loans almost $2 billion annually, and more than 60 percent of these loans will never be repaid because interest rates on the loans are less than the rates the government must pay to borrow money. However, subsidies for the rich and increases in the federal deficit pale in comparison to the third consequence of the REA: nearly 60 years of discouraging research into alternative energies and conservation.</P><P>     The REA subsidized centrally generated power. This created a bias against small-scale alternative energies. Centralized power plants sometimes have cost advantages, what economists call economies of scale. But if delivering this power is expensive, alternative energy sources (e.g. biomass conversions, solar, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, and tidal power) become competitive. Also, people are encouraged to conserve by seeking more-efficient appliances, machinery and tools.</P><P>     The REA eliminated the delivery-cost advantages of alternative energies and discouraged their development. Research into solar and wind power and organic fuels declined sharply after the creation of the REA. Inventors and investors realized that oil, coal, large-scale hydroelectric and eventually nuclear power were favored over small-scale alternatives.</P><P>     For example, Marcellus Jacobs, founder of the once-successful Jacobs Wind Electric Co., states that the spread of REA-subsidized facilities signaled the end of his business. The solar water-heating industry, resurging after World War II, was also stunted by cheap electric rates. Likewise, the ultimate demise of research into tidal power is attributable to the subsidized introduction of cheap electricity.</P><P>     Subsidies usually have negative environmental consequences. In this case, some of the environmental costs are the loss of nearly 60 years of research and development in conservation and alternative energy. In rural areas, the cost of centrally generated power is high. This gave incentive for research and development into small-scale alternative energy and energy conservation. But REA subsidies favored central power.</P><P>     Even when subsidies do some good, such as electrifying rural America, they frequently do great hidden harm. In the case of the REA, the harm is almost 60 years of lost alternative energy research. Subsidized rural electricity has deepened dependence on foreign oil, on dirty coal, on big dams, and on expensive nuclear power.</P><P>     Since alternative futures are unknowable, we cannot know the costs of stifling innovation with subsidies. But we do know there will be costs, and that they are often significant. We know that government subsidies often become twisted to serve the interests of the rich and powerful at the expense of the weak and vulnerable. In the case of the REA, the financial and environmental costs of subsidies have been huge.</P><P>     Government subsidies are dangerous and costly, even when originally intended for good purposes. And once in place, they are very hard to eliminate. Let the public remember this when considering the Clinton administration's new budgets.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P>           AS PRESIDENT-ELECT Clinton and Vice President-elect Gore look toward Jan. 20, they must confront the problem of reconciling their environmental rhetoric with economic reality. Much is promised: Al Gore's environmental commitment is unprecedented for a vice president and adds to pent-up pressures to address environmental concerns.</P><P>       But this pressure comes during a flat economy and, thanks to Ross Perot, a heightened concern for our ballooning federal debt. These problems will seriously constrain the available options. As forest economist Randal O'Toole said, &quot;the federal deficit has become the nation's No. 1 environmental threat.&quot;</P><P>        We see a resolution in Senator Gore's book &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; He links fiscal prudence with environmental concern when he proposes that &quot;the first and most obvious changes involve the elimination of those public expenditures . . . that encourage and subsidize environmentally destructive economic activity.&quot; His position merits the support of both the National Taxpayers Union and Greenpeace. This opportunity was missed by the self-professed &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; administrations of the past 12 years.</P><P>     But if the new administration is to successfully advance such reforms, it must have a strong and consistent messenger to forcefully articulate this vision.</P><P>     Fortunately, one exists. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is an unused treasure. Created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), it was to be the ecological equivalent of the Council of Economic Advisers, &quot;to make and furnish . . . recommendations with respect to matters of (environmental) policy.&quot; But it never exercised a strong voice, and under the Reagan administration its funding was drastically cut. Rather than employing the CEQ as an instrument to advance reforms, the Reagan and Bush administrations simply shunted off, defunded and ignored it.</P><P>     The CEQ is required by law to publish an annual environmental-quality report. This volume can be used to show innovative ways to address environmental problems. Many such opportunities exist.</P><P>     For example, west of the 100th meridian, the federal government owns 50 percent of the land. These lands and waters are prime candidates for such reform. The growing field of environmental history documents the century plus of abuse which has plagued these lands as they were exploited by one constituency after another. The policies of government agencies were consistently rigged to benefit special interests. Heralded reforms only changed the channels of political control; they did not pull the plug.</P><P>     Today the West suffers from the bureaucratic residual of the well-intentioned Progressive Era reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Under the Progressive Era's model, modern science and technology were to advance the public interest. Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (1896) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1902) were created to provide omniscient, benevolent and far-sighted management.</P><P>     But they didn't. In reality, these agencies led to a century of government mismanagement and special-interest plums. Here, as in Eastern Europe, socialized management has failed to meet high environmental or economic standards while eroding ethics of those who work in or deal with the agencies.</P><P>     This is shown in virtually every government land-management agency: In the Northern and Central Rockies, Forest Regions 1 and 2, every forest lost money in fiscal year 1991, while the Forest Service promoted, through creative accounting and outright subsidies, clear-cutting on lands that would not be logged without government help.</P><P>       The Bureau of Land Management short-changes wildlife and encourages overgrazing while charging far below market rates for livestock. The Mining Law of 1872 allows firms to acquire minerals with no royalties, and then claim the land for nominal sums. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers subsidize the damming of free-flowing rivers to the benefit of a few politically powerful irrigation interests.</P><P>     Politics distorts National Park Service management of sensitive ecosystems and leads to massive disturbances of supposedly protected areas. These are the predictable consequences of political management.</P><P>     All of these abuses are ecologically and economically wasteful. They continue, of course, because the interests who benefit from these arrangements fight to maintain their favored status. They see their way of life threatened by reforms.</P><P>     They are not paranoid. It is threatened, and should be. Most of these government programs are disguised welfare. But in the mountains and on the plains as elsewhere, welfare generates dependency, not wealth. A program's existence should not guarantee its continuance.</P><P>     Perception of our fiscal crisis can drive these overdue reforms. By making users of federal lands, including recreation users, pay their own way, we can address both budgetary and ecological concerns. Hard-nosed analysis must be applied to other government programs as well. For example, government-subsidized coastal flood insurance, in addition to being a subsidy for wealthy home builders and buyers, increases seaside development in ecologically sensitive areas.</P><P>     In this world of scarcity we should always combine environmental concern with economic awareness. The Council on Environmental Quality can articulate these visions. Just as the Council of Economic Advisers has at times provided a strong voice for innovative economic policy prescriptions, the CEQ can provide a strong platform for environmental reform. If the environmental promises of our new administration are to be honored, they must harmonize the environment with economic forces. The CEQ can explain and advertise the appropriate reforms.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Publications -- Heritage</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2><I><FONT SIZE = "+3">P</FONT>ublications</I></H2></CENTER>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
Ideas count - and the best way to express ideas remains the written word. Heritage 
offered Washington lots of words in 1994,  publishing more than 250 books, 
monographs, and policy studies. The papers ranged from brief commentaries to 
5,000-to-10,000-word "Backgrounders" and lengthier monographs, such as 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues 
'94: The Candidate's Briefing Book</a>," "A Citizen's Guide to Regulation," and 
"
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 1995 publication released in December. Regular 
newsletters included "Heritage Today" and  "Heritage Members News," featuring 
information about Heritage Foundation people and activities; "The Insider," 
reporting on publications and activities of Resource Bank groups; "Business/Education 
Insider," focusing on the role of business in education reform; and "Reforming 
Congress: Changing the Way Washington Works," which kept a watchful eye on 
the wayward Congress.
<P>
While Heritage research papers are provided free of charge to the policy-making 
community, there is great demand beyond that. In addition to printed copies, 
most Heritage policy studies also are available electronically on the NEXIS 
data-retrieval system and <a href="http://www.townhall.com">Town Hall</a>, the conservative computer network co-owned 
by Heritage and National Review. Town Hall operates as a private forum on CompuServe. 
Some Heritage publications are available additionally on audiotape. 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eview</H3></CENTER>

Heritage's flagship publication is <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>. Sprightly and unpredictable, 
Policy Review reached an all-time high in paid circulation in 1994: 30,000, 
a 30 percent  increase over the previous year. 
<p>
Policy Review's impact, however, continued to exceed its circulation. The summer 
issue, for example, featured a prescient article, "Flanagan's Island: How Boys 
Town Rescues Troubled Teens." Following the GOP sweep in November's congressional 
elections, Boys Town became a symbol for the kind of "tough love" proposed 
in the GOP's welfare-reform plan. The spring issue featured an article by Houston 
constable Victor Trevino, "Zebra Territory: The Courage of Houston's Volunteer 
Cops." A Mexican immigrant, Trevino told how he has organized volunteer patrols 
in his district, cutting truancy in half and crime by 10 percent without increasing 
taxes. The fall issue featured a headline-making article by  Rush Limbaugh: 
"Voice of America: Why Liberals Fear Me."  Excerpts appeared in the Sunday 
Los Angeles Times and dozens of other newspapers. The talk-radio phenomenon 
had been explored earlier in the year in "The Gurus of Gab," a lively symposium 
featuring 10 of America's top talkers. Among the prominent political figures 
with 1994 Policy Review bylines were Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX); Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-TX); Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL); and Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.

<p>
"This is Mike Rosen, KOA, Denver broadcasting live from the studios of The 
Heritage Foundation in Washington."
<P>
Those and similar words were heard frequently by talk-radio listeners around 
the country in 1994, following the opening of Heritage's new broadcast facilities. 
Equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, the studio enables talk-show hosts 
to do live broadcasts from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.
<P>
Heritage already was becoming a "home away from home" for talk show hosts visiting 
the nation's capital, with live broadcasts during the year by Boston's Earl 
Jackson, Seattle's Dave Ross, and Richmond's Blanquita Walsh Cullum, among 
others. The remote broadcast facilities were opened to meet the growing demand. 
<P>

<P>
Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast media program, 
began several years ago - long before most other organizations realized the 
potential impact of this alternative communications medium.  
<P>
During 1994, Heritage experts made hundreds of guest appearances on radio talk 
shows, on  major television news and public affairs shows, and on the America's 
Talking, CNN, CNBC, C-SPAN, and National Empowerment Television (NET) call-in 
shows. Dozens of Heritage lectures and events also were seen on C-SPAN.  
<P>
The work with the broadcast media is just one facet of Heritage's wide-ranging 
communications program. Intended to familiarize political activists, opinion 
leaders, and the broader general public with the positive message of contemporary 
conservatism, the program also includes the Heritage Speakers Bureau, Heritage's 
pioneering "op-ed page" program, and a variety of other activities aimed at 
specialized audiences.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">O</FONT>pinion and <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommentary</H3></CENTER>

<P>
The op-ed page program provides Heritage analysts and executives with an opportunity 
to give their views on the important issues of the day without having to go 
through the usual news "filtering" process. During 1994, Heritage bylines appeared 
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, 
Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington 
Times,  International Herald Tribune, USA Today, Buffalo News, Charlotte Observer, 
Oklahoma City Oklahoman, Orange County Register, and Pittsburgh Tribune Review. 
  <P>


Heritage also continued its relationship with Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service, 
one of the largest supplemental newswires in the country, which distributes 
Heritage op-ed page essays every week as part of a <a href="/heritage/commentary/welcome.html">commentary</a> package.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>argeted <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommunications</H3></CENTER>
<P>
While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass media, targeted 
communications also are important. 
<P>
The Speakers Bureau, for example, helped bring Heritage's conservative message 
to dozens of college campuses and business, professional, and civic organizations 
in 1994. While their primary focus remained  research, writing, and policy, 
Heritage analysts and executives met collectively with thousands of individuals 
around the country who had come to hear them speak. Among the many institutions 
providing Heritage speakers with a platform were the American Association of 
Colleges and Universities, American Society of Association Executives, Chautauqua 
Institution, Close Up Foundation, Colorado State University, and Grove City 
College, where Ed Feulner delivered the 1994 commencement address. Others included 
the Inter-American Defense College, National Petroleum Refiners Association, 
National Youth Leadership Forum, People to People, Rubber Manufacturers Association, 
St. Lawrence University, Texas A&M University, and World Affairs Council of 
Orange County. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/">Town Hall</a>, the "interactive" computer network co-owned by 
Heritage and National Review magazine, Heritage in 1994 was included in "Profnet," 
a national computer information network linking U.S. newsrooms with colleges 
and universities and a handful of think tanks around the country.
<P>
Heritage also continued to work closely in 1994 with Westcott Communications, 
a major publicly traded company that provides information and produces workplace 
training videos for corporate managers and executives in a number of specialized 
fields, including health care and financial management.
<P>


And Heritage successfully relaunched the Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific 
Press (WRAPP). The organization, which had existed for several years in the 
1980s, is intended to help provide Washington-based Asian correspondents with 
better access to the Washington policymaking .

In Civilized Society, Shame Has Place -- Empower

<h2>
In Civilized Society, Shame Has Place
</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 26, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 

<p>
A few months ago, Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn. ), Sam Nunn (D-Ga. ) and I began a campaign to focus public scrutiny on certain daytime television talk shows and their sponsors. The objects of our criticism are not close calls. They are shows that typically cross way over the line. We have described their content as cultural rot. How else could one describe shows whose typical subjects include a 17-year-old girl boasting of having slept with more than 100 men, a 13-year-old talking about sexual experiences that began when she was 10 and "Women Who Marry Their Rapists."
<p>
A number of commentators have defended these talk shows for "reflecting reality," arguing that our campaign won't succeed and that sponsors are within their "rights" to advertise on their programs. It is useful, then, to explain what we are attempting to do and what we are not.
<p>
First, our campaign is not about rights. We are not trying to curb-free speech. I am a virtual absolutist on the 1st Amendment and we have been emphatic about not arguing for censorship. Nor is our goal to remove every last vestige of garbage from our social landscape; this is impossible in a free society.
<p>
But we are asking talk show hosts and advertisers to reconsider their support of some of this daytime television fare. If they continue their support, we are asking that they be able to justify publicly what they are doing, which is to "mainstream" trashy behavior.
<p>
Almost every society has its red-light districts. That is part of reality, and we all understand that. A free society can tolerate such districts. But society should also do what it can to discourage them and contain them. And so, too, with the popular culture version of red-light districts. They ought to remain on the periphery, away from Main Street, our living rooms, our schoolyards.
<p>
Recent postgame interviews with athletes help illustrate a similar point: NFL players feel free to curse on the field and in the locker room. Not many people object to that. But it is nonetheless true that what you have a right to do is not always right to do. And it is wrong for people, even athletes, to curse on camera for national television.
<p>
The aim of our campaign is to use nongovernmental means to make the case that such cultural trash should be less pervasive. We believe that a sense of shame still exists in the highest reaches of corporate America and in the entertainment industry. We believe, too, that progress can be made, through moral suasion, not government intervention. And we intend to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural guardrails, certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and consensus.
<p>
All of this requires that we make normative judgments. Of course, some people balk at any attempt to do this, even as they balk at any effort to declare some things worthy and some things unworthy of human consumption. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he wrote in his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" that something that uplifts human personality is just and some thing that degrades human personality is unjust.
<p>
Instead of simply lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need to do something about it. After all, we are witnessing the pollution of the human environment. Cleaning out our cultural air ducts won't happen by itself; it requires concerted effort and specific action. Five years ago, our effort would not have resonated nearly so much with the public. But we have hit a cultural nerve. What we are seeing, here and elsewhere, is the shock of recognition that in too many places, not just in back alleys but in the main thoroughfares, America has been cheapened. We, the American people, have allowed this desecration to occur. It is past time that we do something about it.

<center><h2>A Pro-Growth Compromise</h2> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 19, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
We live in an extraordinary era -- when two former mortal enemies throughout half of 
this century can meet in cooperation hundreds of miles overhead.  If American astronauts 
and Russian cosmonauts can forge a partnership in space, surely the leaders of the 
preeminent institution in the history of the world can do at least as well on <i>terra 
firma</i>.  And they <i>can</i>.  The current impasse between Congress and the White 
House can be broken with a pro-growth tax policy which will allow both sides to declare 
a win.  It is no secret that the holdup between President Clinton and the Republican 
Congressional leadership has been over whose economic model would be used in passing 
a budget.  The White House preferred their own Office of Management and Budgets', 
which paints a moderately rosy picture of the economy over the next seven years, while 
the Congressional leadership favored the more non-partisan Congressional Budget 
Office's bleaker outlook which required bigger cuts and more fiscal restraint in order to 
get the budget in balance by 2002. 
<P> 
Up until the president vetoed the Budget Reconciliation yesterday (?), the Republican 
leadership was bound to hold fast to the economic assumptions of the Congressional 
Budget Office.  The arduous process of reconciling the budget disallowed any adjustment 
to CBO's predictions on economic growth without starting the long budget process over 
again at square one.  In other words, if the GOP had blinked in their negotiations with the 
president last week, they would have placed the entire year's work on the reconciliation in 
jeopardy.  Now that the budget has been vetoed by the president, it can be altered without 
the cumbersome rules governing the reconciliation. 
<P> 
The problems last week came when the president understandably tried to negotiate with 
the GOP on their budget language attached to the Continuing Resolution, which would 
have averted the partial governmental shutdown.  But, due to the importance of passing 
the reconciliation on Friday, the GOP had no room to compromise.  Even a non-binding 
compromise at that point would have undermined the hard-fought cuts, passed in large 
part due to the GOP's freshman class, and thus threatened final passage on the budget.  
And not only were the long term benefits of a balanced budget and restrained spending at 
stake, the real crown jewels of the budget, which are the pro-growth, pro-family tax cuts 
from the Contract With America, were at risk. 
<P> 
Furthermore, the GOP would have been ill-advised to break their promise to balance the 
budget made during the electoral sweep of 1994.  Therefore, they still cannot venture 
away from the CBO numbers or their budget will be labeled as a deficit building 
proposal.   
<P> 
Now that the budget is back in the hands of Congress and can be revised, there is an 
obvious solution to the stalemate which will save the Republican's balanced budget while 
still giving the President some elbow room on spending restraints he can live with.  And 
most importantly of all, this solution will afford the American economy the opportunity 
to grow and flourish during the next seven years -- which is a benefit neither of the 
current proposals have yet to promise. 
<P> 
Congress has been using CBO's very conservative growth predictions which were 
calculated in April of this year.  Again, because they started the process with these 
numbers, they could not change them mid-stream without beginning the entire process 
from scratch.  Since CBO updates its predictions throughout the year, there already exists 
a considerably more optimistic set of assumptions approved in August.  Congress can 
now alter its baseline predictions for the budget to the new CBO numbers and have a lot 
of room to negotiate without losing their "balance".  The CBO's January 1996 numbers 
are expected to be even more positive. 
<P> 
The August CBO numbers give Congress $29 billion dollars more to work with in the 
first two years, and this does not account for the additional amount made available with 
next January's adjustment.  This will theoretically be more than enough room to give the 
president his measure of "victory" in the form of more spending on education, Medicare, 
and other programs near and dear to his heart.  Better yet, it could also leave enough 
money to pay for, in my view, the Contract With America's most important provision -- 
the indexation of capital gains.  Clearly a win for both sides of this standoff and certainly 
a win for the American electorate. 
<P> 
Moreover, if the GOP can reach an agreement on the balanced budget that includes the 
indexation on capital gains they will have won a double victory for the American people.  
For, while the CBO and the OMB consider the indexation as a net cost due to their 
mostly static model, in actuality, indexation on capital gains will provide a boon to the 
economy and, subsequently, an increase in federal revenue.   
<P> 
It works like this:  (1) high tax rates discourage entrepreneurship and investment which, 
in turn, prohibits growth in the national economy; (2) without indexation, the already 
high capital gains tax rate is effectively escalated, leaving entrepreneurs to pay taxes on 
inflated gains; (3) indexation of capital gains would result in a lower effective tax rate 
than a straight cut in the tax rate itself would (assuming a 3% real rate of return, the 
current CPI rate of about 3% carries a real tax rate of 56%--even reducing the nominal 
rate to 19.5% with no indexing would mean a real capital gains rate of nearly 40% at 
current rates of inflation.); (4) therefore, instituting the indexation on capital gains would 
remove or diminish existing barriers to entrepreneurship and investment and thereby free 
up capital in the economy.  This would create a more efficient and liquid capital market, 
drawing capital to low-income and high-risk entrepreneurial ventures. 
<P> 
The president and Congress must reach an agreement soon.  The American people will 
not stand for an on-going stalemate.  None of the parties involved, though, will concede 
defeat on one of the most watched budget debates in our history.  President Clinton, 
Speaker Gingrich, Senator Dole, and their ranks must move quickly to take advantage of 
this unique opportunity to both balance the budget and spur tremendous economic growth 
as we enter the twenty-first century.

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the 1970's, the Kerner Commission report sparked a national debate with its assessment of America as two cities, one black and one white, permanently divided into two almost irreconcilable classes.  While the divide which the Kerner Commission exposed was, in so far as it goes, a real and significant problem for the nation, the Commission's diagnosis was, in our opinion, wrong.  America is not divided into two classes based on race; it is divided into two economies.   
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy, based on private property and rewards for productive human activity.  However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third-World socialist welfare state that places barriers and impediments to productive human activity. This fact has become increasingly clear over the past two decades, and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, D.C.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In Washington, dire financial problems coupled with one of the highest marginal income tax rates in the country and a consequent middle class exodus have only emphasized the dichotomy between two coexisting economies:  a democratic capitalist, market-oriented, entrepreneurial economy which rewards work, investment, saving and productivity; and a second near-socialist economy which, though set up with noble intentions, places barriers to productive human and social activity and has a virtual absence of economic incentive. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1960, the population of the District has declined by 25 percent, as both black and white residents have escaped the burden of high taxes coupled with poor quality services and education.  This development simply compounds other economic and social problems in the capital city.    
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The reality is, the system in the District is in a crisis.  The capital city is in danger of falling victim to the inertia of the status quo.  And politically expedient, short-term solutions, while they may temporarily slow the decline in the capital's struggling economy, will not fix the underlying problem.   But in keeping with our national spirit of indomitable optimism, we view this crisis as an opportunity -- an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans, blacks and whites, conservatives and liberals, in both public and private sectors to work together to demonstrate incontrovertibly that freedom and free enterprise solutions work.
At this critical juncture in the District's history, the finger-pointing and acrimony over who's at fault for the various problems must end.  Virtually all parties, the Congress and the D.C. government, have had a hand in allowing the problems to escalate to this serious level.  And likewise, we must together find ways to heal and rebuild the District into a shining city on a hill for the rest of the world to see and emulate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Spending cuts and fiscal restraint must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital.  But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.  Ms. Norton has introduced the D.C. Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Her plan, which would tax all individuals at a single, low rate with generous deductions for families would take low-income families off the tax rolls and at the same time promote working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship -- all things of which the District is desperately in need.  Most of all, a zero capital gains tax on people and businesses in the city would attract both capital and people back into the city and would allow low- and middle- income people the access to the capital necessary to start their version of the American dream.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle praised Representative Norton for her proposal.  In fact, one of the only reservations to surface was a fear that the District, which has a history of tax increases, would raise local rates to take advantage of the increase in after-tax income that Norton's bill would provide to the middle class taxpayer.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The obvious answer to that concern is to introduce a plan for the District's local tax system that would mirror the federal system proposed by Norton.  In other words, not only would D.C. residents and businesses have a low single tax rate at the federal level, they would also have a low single rate at the local level.  The result of the complementary plans would create a flood of capital and credit into the District which would dramatically expand the tax base, easily raise more revenues than the current systems and help attract the middle class back into the District.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The out-lying suburbs in Virginia and Maryland, contrary to their fears, would also feel a positive impact from the District's recovery.  They must realize that economics in a free-market system is not a zero-sum game.  Economic activity in the area will pick up, more people will buy homes, create jobs, and consume goods and services.  Economic vitality will not stop at the borders of the District of Columbia, it will inevitably spill over. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The necessary reforms, including a thorough review of the fundamental structure of D.C. home rule, if undertaken with reason and given time and resources, will transform the District to the thriving capital city we all envision, attracting new residents and families rather than forcing them away.  Congress, the mayor, the council, the control board, local businesses, D.C. residents, and the outlying suburbs all have an important role to play in Washington's transformation, but all parties must lay aside previously held biases or ill-feelings for past transgressions or failings.  All stake-holders in the District's revitalization, including the president of the United States, must come together to begin forging a vision for the future of the District of Columbia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Despite sharp political and philosophical division, consensus can be reached on a way to obtain full representation for D.C. residents, improve management and oversight and increase revenues.  Unless the core issues that affect the city's foundation are honestly addressed, the underpinnings of Home Rule will remain tenuous.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The budget and management problems faced by the city are not unique.  Washington is not the first city to require outside assistance to help resolve a complicated fiscal dilemma.  Other jurisdictions have met the challenge.  For a multitude of reasons, the District has not.  However, rather than assign blame, the prudent course of action is simply to keep the pressure on.  Somewhere amid the mire and misery is a diamond of a city, yearning to be uncovered so that it can shine as an example for others to follow.

<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>Outcome-Based Education</h2>
<P><i>March 19, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
				
There are serious, legitimate concerns surrounding outcome-based education (OBE).  In 
principle, it sounds good.  In practice, however, OBE can be used to undermine parental 
authority and traditional moral and religious beliefs.  This explains why much of the 
criticism of OBE has come largely from parents' rights groups.<p>

A key to understanding outcome-based education depends on making the distinction 
between cognitive outcomes (i.e., the development of intellectual abilities and skills) 
and behavioral and social outcomes (i.e., the shaping of social attitudes, values, and 
interpersonal relationships).<p>

A case can be made on behalf of outcome-based education if it is confined to cognitive 
outcomes; that is, if we objectively measure students' knowledge in the basics -- math, 
science, history, and English.  Some people still believe that OBE can be used to advance 
such ends (a good example of OBE, properly utilized, is the current high school 
Advanced Placement exam, in which students do not get credit for their course unless 
they demonstrate proficiency in a rigorous nationwide test).  This explains why 
conservative education reformers like Chester Finn, Jr. have spoken well of cognitively-
based outcomes.<p>

The real concern is when those in the education establishment use OBE to (1) eliminate 
objective measurable criteria (like standardized tests); (2) do away with the traditional 
subject-based curriculum in favor of an emphasis on things like general skills, attitudes 
and behaviors; and (3) advance their own radical social agenda.  Increasingly, OBE is 
applied to the realm of behavior and social attitudes--becoming, in effect, a Trojan Horse 
for social engineering, an elementary and secondary school version of the kind of 
&quot;politically correct&quot; thinking that has infected our colleges and universities.<p>

Outcome-based education raises a number of questions:  what if parents do not want 
their children to view all lifestyles as equal?  What if a young person has developed 
strong personal convictions based on traditional moral standards?  Will students who do 
not give  &quot;appropriate&quot; responses to desired &quot;outcomes&quot; still be allowed to graduate?  It is 
also worth noting that little in the way of public input is sought when it comes to OBE, 
and it offers no method of accountability.<p>


There are some other problems associated with OBE, including:<p>
<ul>
<li>	The &quot;dumbing down&quot; of classes.  Many of the curricula being developed call for 
teachers to wait for all students to understand all aspects of a subject before moving 
on.  Many parents fear that this will penalize more advanced students.

<li>	Traditional education terms are being reinterpreted.  In some programs, <i>cognitive</i> 
now refers to &quot;a belief system,&quot; and <i>critical thinking</i> refers to &quot;a willingness to 
question everything, including one's deepest convictions, beliefs and relationships.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Some of the confusion surrounding outcome-based education is based on semantics.  The 
conservative education reform movement of the 1980s wanted to focus on outcomes (i.e., 
knowledge gained) instead of inputs (i.e., dollars spent).  The aim was to ensure greater 
accountability.  What the education establishment has done is to appropriate the term but 
change the intent.

In short, the &quot;outcomes&quot; increasingly being measured are not based on objective and 
measurable criteria like standardized tests; the state-desired outcome is increasingly 
based on vague, subjective social aims.  Consider some of the vocabulary that surrounds 
OBE:  words like &quot;openness to change,&quot; &quot;appreciation of the global community,&quot; 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; and &quot;higher-order thinking skills.&quot;<p>

There is a big push in the country on behalf of outcome-based education.  But unless 
some means is found to ensure that it serves the traditional aims of sound intellectual and 
moral education, it should be resisted.<p>

<title>Transforming the Welfare Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Transforming the Welfare Debate</h2>
<b>William J. Bennett & Peter Wehner</b></center>
<hr>
<p>
The welfare reform debate of the past two years will soon crystallize into a vote.  The Senate is scheduled to begin floor debate on a finalized welfare reform proposal in early August; the date for a final vote is not yet known.  Even less clear, however, is what that proposal will be. 
<p>
There are two competing Republican welfare reform plans under consideration.  The first, sponsored by Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, has undergone several changes within the past month.  At this writing, it converts several welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) into five separate block grants which would be turned over to the states, along with the responsibility of managing and administering poverty-fighting programs with this funding.  
<p>
Although it is a clear improvement over the current system, the Packwood bill has several significant shortcomings.  It promises devolution of resources and authority to state governments to enable them to enact innovative reforms.  But in reality, it saddles them with the most stifling and inflexible mandates in the current JOBS federal workfare program.   Even the Senate Democrats' welfare bill drops the JOBS program, which is widely regarded as heavily bureaucratized and ineffective.  Moreover, the Packwood bill places oversight of the states' use of block grants in the most bureaucratized agencies.  Most importantly, there are no serious measures to decrease illegitimacy, despite the obvious link between out-of-wedlock births and long-term welfare dependency.  
<p>
A competing bill was recently introduced by Senators Gramm, Ashcroft and Faircloth, and is rapidly gaining support. We consider this legislation, the "Work, Family and Community Welfare Reform Act," to be the best welfare reform legislation we have seen.  
<p>
The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is politically and intellectually significant, and it reflects the extraordinary shift that has taken place in the debate over welfare. It is significant that today nobody -- nobody -- is willing to defend the current welfare system.  And for good reason:  it is a complete wreck.  After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60's and 70's has been a terrible failure.  Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago. 
<p>
There are several important components of the Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill.    This legislation ends welfare as an entitlement and turns it over to the states, those "laboratories of democracy," to enable them to enact radical and innovative reforms, tailored to the needs and circumstances of their citizens.  It removes the meddlesome presence of the biggest federal bureaucracies from the administration of poverty programs.  It encourages adoption, one of the most important and overlooked issues in the realm of contemporary social policy.  And it recognizes that illegitimacy is the driving force behind welfare dependency, and takes steps to counteract the increase in out-of-wedlock births by ending cash payments to unwed teen mothers and eliminating the increase in cash handouts to welfare beneficiaries who have additional children out of wedlock.  
<p>
By the end of the decade, according to the most reliable projections, 40 percent of all American births and 80 percent of minority births will be out-of-wedlock.  These numbers have frightening social implications.  Welfare may not cause illegitimacy, but it does make it economically viable.  Welfare is illegitimacy's life-support system.
<p>
The good news is that we are reaching agreement on an important moral principle:  having children out-of-wedlock is wrong -- not simply economically unwise for the individuals involved, or a financial burden on society, but morally wrong.  The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is consistent with that principle.  
<p>
Another important component of this welfare bill would enable the states to contract with private institutions, including religious institutions, that run successful poverty-fighting programs.  In historian Marvin Olasky's exhaustive study of poverty-fighting in the United States, he concluded that the most effective poverty-fighting programs are those that are challenging, personal, and often, spiritual -- the exact antithesis of the bureaucratic, impersonal entitlement that is welfare "as we know it." 
<p>
Conservatives shouldn't pretend that welfare reform of this magnitude will not involve some dislocation and hardship.  But the current system -- designed, built and maintained by the architects of contemporary liberalism -- is exacting a far higher human cost.  Unless a principled and fundamentally different alternative is put into place, the body count will continue to rise.  So we have an obligation to act boldly and responsibly.
<p>
The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is far-reaching, intelligent and humane.  It is intelligent because it focuses on the underlying causes of long-term poverty and welfare dependency:  illegitimacy and family breakdown.  And it is humane because many more people will live far better lives by scrapping a failed system that subsidizes out-of-wedlock births.  The case for ending welfare is to promote policies which will help ameliorate the social pathologies and human misery that engulfs much of urban America.  The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill will go a long way towards doing just that.  
<p>
There is one provision with which we do not agree:  denying assistance to legal immigrants, regardless of their circumstances.  We simply think that this is the wrong way to go.  But all things considered, this is still the best bill in the Senate.  It injects moral common sense into this debate.  
<p>
At this point the Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth legislation faces stiff opposition from some members of the Senate Republican Leadership (who favor Packwood's proposal) and Senate Democrats.  But its appeal is growing, as is its number of cosponsors.  Its passage would have several important consequences.  First, given its greater similarity to the welfare reform bill passed by the House of Representatives, the chances for achieving consensus with House delegates during the House-Senate conference will be far greater.  
<p>
Second, it will force President Clinton to make a clear choice.  There will be a lot of pressure for the President to make good on his promise to "end welfare as we know it" and sign the legislation.   If he vetoes it, he will have reneged on his promise, sabotaged the most significant welfare reforms in the American history, and perpetuated the status quo -- a political, if not a policy, victory for the Republican party.
<p>
Our current welfare system is the most pernicious set of government programs of the past three decades.  We have lost large parts of an entire generation because of the human wreckage left in its wake.  This bill will begin to undo some of the damage.  For that reason, we believe it merits support.

<center>
<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>School Choice</h2>
<P><i>February 23, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 In 1983, President Reagan's Commission on Excellence in Schools
released its report, <I>A Nation At Risk</I>, warning of major
problems plaguing the public school system.  Today, more than
ten years later, low test scores, consistently high drop-out rates,
drug use, and increasing violence characterize many of our public
schools.  American education is still in crisis, and we need a
change.
<P>
 The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority.  People around the country sense this:  In 1994, twenty-five
states had some form of school choice legislation pending or introduced.
 Denis Doyle, writing in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> (June
13, 1995) indicates that teachers, both public and private, are
more likely to send their children to private schools than the
general public (17.1 percent vs. 13.1 percent).  And in urban
areas like Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland, the percentage of public
school teachers who send their children to private schools is
much higher.  The widespread support for school choice is part
of the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
 School vouchers would provide all parents -- regardless of income
level -- with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child.  If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school.  If they are not, parents now have
a choice -- they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school.  This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University.  Higher education performs better
because of it.
<P>
 School choice allows all schools -- including private and religious
schools -- to compete for public dollars.  In addition, a voucher
system will save taxpayers money, and would promote a healthy
scholastic rivalry between public and private schools, as well
as among public schools, challenging them to serve parents and
students better.
<P>
 The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
 School choice is the most important and far-reaching education
reform in America.  It empowers parents to select schools that
reflect the values and the academic goals that they hold for their
children.

  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<title>Kemp:  Op-Ed on Immigration</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<img src = "/empower/easmall.gif">
<center><h3>Immigration:  Where We Go From Here</h3> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 27, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 American immigrants generate jobs, products, processes, small
businesses, and government revenues at a pace that far exceeds
any strain on U.S. resources.  This is not just my conclusion;
  former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead, U.S. News Editor
Mortimer Zuckerman, IBM Vice President Ed Zschau, Texas Instruments
CEO Jerry Junkins, and a dozen other investment, manufacturing,
and communications leaders expressed the same conclusion in a
recent joint statement.
<P>
Some immigration policies badly need reform, especially those
having to do with illegal immigration.  Under the 1986 immigration
reform act, for example, it's illegal to hire an undocumented
alien, and hard and costly even to hire a legal one.  By contrast,
it's allowed, and in many cases legally mandated, to pay out welfare,
medical, education and other benefits.
<P>
It would be better, and more American, to make it easy to work--for
example, with a generous guest worker program and low-cost i.d.
for participants.  It would be just and would create better incentives,
and make it harder to get welfare payments.  For instance, the
U.S. could more readily accept immigrants who take a pledge not
to go on welfare (a pledge many have already taken).
<P>
With such policies, we not only can &quot;afford&quot; to keep
the golden door open;  we will attract the same type of dynamic
men and women who historically helped build this immigrant nation.
 Let's agree to reform the welfare state and not allow America
to be turned into a police state.

WINCONFERENCE '95<BR>
Geneva, Switzerland<BR>
May 5, 1995<BR>
by Jack Kemp<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


Thank you for the opportunity to address WINCONFERENCE 1995.  I am especially honored to be in the company of such distinguished speakers as President Von Weizsacker, Minister Wu Ti, Arthur Dunkel, and Professors Robert Fogel and Grigory Yavlinsky.
<P>
As we begin the celebration in but two days, of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, we are reminded of how far the world has progressed.  The victory of Nazism and Fascism are outdone only by the more recent victories over Communism and apartheid.  We are seeing, however, not just an ending but the triumph of those 18th-century liberal democratic ideas today in extraordinary ways and in places we could never have predicted just a few years ago.
<P>
Consider events in South Africa.  Many people--with good reason--expected the Mandela government to lean leftward toward socialism and collectivism.  But look at what South Africa is doing in the field of housing. <I> The Wall Street Journal </I>reported recently, "The new South African Government's approach to housing for the poor is quite different from those of Western nations: the emphasis is on private ownership, not subsidized rental. . . . the South African way offers a route for its poor to build a better life, step by step.  Moreover, it is a historic departure from those of first-world welfare states and merits consideration elsewhere."
<P>
We live in a historical moment of tremendous opportunity in the world economy--a moment when so many nations are finally escaping the prison of centrally planned economies to discover the new world of free markets, free economies, free trade and free people.  It isn't very orderly and it isn't inevitable, but it's an exciting opportunity for leadership.
<P>
In addition, the United States has experienced no less than a political revolution in the last six months.  The Republicans, led by Speaker Gingrich, now control the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954.  Due in great measure to that shift of political power, in my opinion, the United States is poised to make significant contributions to the global economy.
<P>
I've been asked to speak specifically about America's role in this new world.  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say that America's policies and America's attitudes will help determine not only its shape but its future.  America's foreign policy, and that of our friends and allies, has, at its best, long sought to advance the inter-connected causes of economic freedom and liberal democracy.  After the Second Work War, the United States recognized it had a responsibility as steward of these ideals.  The policy of containment was conceived not merely as military and territorial, but also as economic and ideological.  In announcing the Truman doctrine before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned:
<P>
The seeds of oppressive regimes are nurtured by misery and want.  They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife.  They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.
<P>
We must keep that hope alive, indeed nurture and enhance it in the world.
<P>
The United States had enough faith in our democratic political system to help establish it in the lands of our former adversaries--and now close allies--Japan and Germany.
<P>
But we did more.  We recognized that a free international order requires certain international institutions to maintain it.  With the memories of beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism of the 1930s still fresh in our minds, the United States helped lead the world in establishing, at Bretton Woods, an international trading system and monetary regime based on a common and predictable unit of account, thereby removing exchange rate instabilities and fluctuations.  We have worked together in GATT to establish a system of open, free trade among nations.  All of this laid the groundwork for the incredible growth of work trade and the remarkable stability of the new quarter century as the West recovered from World War II.
<P>
It is my belief that an active, engaged America, and a United Europe, must help play that same vital role today;  promoting free markets, restoring stable and honest money, and helping build the institutions of democratic capitalism (particularly in the third world and former communist nations).  But fulfilling that promise directly depends on avoiding two great temptations.
<P>
One is the temptation of isolationism and protectionism which is sometimes found on the far-right.  The other temptation is the mindless multi-lateralism of the left.
<P>
With regard to the first temptation, two events have reshaped America's image of itself since World War II.  First is the recovery and prosperity of the Pacific Rim and Europe in particular.  Protectionist have attempted to use this fact to stir up resentment and fear.
<P>
Second, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own brutality and broken promises.  Isolationist have tried to use this as an argument that America's international role has ended.
<P>
The goal of both isolationists and protectionists is the same;  to narrow America's focus to domestic concerns, protect our markets and allow a world of strangers to take care of itself.
<P>
But the whole approach is based on the myth that the world economy is a zero-sum game, where every winner must be matched by a loser.
<P>
Fortunately, I think that most Americans and Europeans recognize and understand that the growth and prosperity of a unified Europe is good for America, and the growth and prosperity of the United States is good for Europe.  I was a strong supporter of NAFTA and GATT because I believe they are a vision of the entire world's future--free trade that extends to the Pacific rim and Europe so all can share in new markets and new prosperity from expanding global markets.  Now is the time to link a new trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade zone to NAFTA.
<P>
Protectionism in any form undermines efficiency by creating privileged industries and reducing the standard of living of workers and consumers.  Free trade is the best way to promote international development and attack third-work poverty.  Open markets bring benefits to both consumers in developed nations and workers in developing ones and vice versa.
<P>
The second great temptation, which is more common on the left, is for the United States to remain involved in the world, but to pursue a mindless and counter-productive multi-lateralism which turns over the economies of Third World and Eastern European countries to the IMF.  Mexico has been the most disturbing and recent example of the zero-sum approach.
<P>
The crisis in Mexico was not caused by some unexplainable force or unavoidable economic law.  It was caused by an explicit policy decision by the Clinton administration and international financial institutions, a policy of competitive devaluation that is based on the idea that Mexico would be better off by repudiating its debt, devaluing its currency, and dramatically reducing its imports.  The United States and the IMF advised the Mexican Government to devalue the peso, which has led to the institution of wage and price controls, higher taxes, the adoption of a comprehensive austerity, and loss of jobs, wages and pensions.
<P>
But austerity and devaluation are the problem, not the solution.  You can not enrich poor nations by impoverishing their people.  The answer to poverty is economic growth and entrepreneurial capitalism, which flow from the freedom of individuals to work, save, invest, be entrepreneurs and produce new wealth.  The role of government is to protect these freedoms.  This means preserving the value of people's money, not cheating them out of their savings, pensions and wages through so-called competitive devaluation.
<P>
Governments have a moral and pragmatic responsibility to protect, promote, and preserve the value of their currencies.  Argentina's minister of finance, Domingo Cavallo, put it best when he said his currency, the peso, is "a contract between the government and the peso holder.  That contract guarantees that each peso-- as a unit of value that the holder has worked hard to get--will be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.  If the government breaks that contact, it's breaking the law.  The only role of the government in the economy should be to guarantee the integrity of market transactions."  He could have said the same thing about the U.S. Dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the Yen, the Swiss Franc or any other currency.
<P>
It is interesting that ten years ago, when the dollar was a at a peak, the U.S. was advised that the budget deficit was causing the dollar to soar, and thus causing a trade deficit.  Now the dollar has fallen compared to the Yen from 270 to 83, yet the trade deficit has increased.  The conventional wisdom is telling us that our budget deficit causes a weak dollar and thus a trade deficit.  The lesson in this?  There is no connection between exchange rates and budget deficits.  You cannot cure a monetary problem with a fiscal solution.
<P>
A nation's people are its primary source of wealth.  What they need most is honest money and low tax rates to create opportunity--access to capital, ownership, and entrepreneurialism, which create wealth, jobs and enterprises.  Jude Wanniski, author of<I> The Way the World Works</I>, explained it well when he wrote, "The difference between people is the difference in the amount of capital available to them--financial capital or education capital.  Men are the same everywhere in the world, insofar as you give them a shovel to dig a hole with.  They do about as well in Rwanda, Bulgaria, Morristown or Sacramento.  Because we dig with power tools here and with sticks in Rwanda, our real wages are much higher.  If you tax capital too heavily, you are taxing this type of capital, and thus limiting the incomes of people."
<P>
We in the developed nations of the world should use our resources to help foster third-world and former Soviet bloc countries in the skills of market capitalism.  We should help build the institutions that liberate individual enterprise--private property, access to market, access to credit, stable legal structures, and easy incorporation of new businesses.  This is the best hope of developing world and the best definition of true cooperation and compassion for the less developed world.
<P>
The conventional wisdom on the left and the right all too often says the same thing:  that economic recovery, if possible at all, will be painful, hard to endure, and of such duration that not much can be done except inject massive doses of government assistance and IMF austerity.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly the same thing people said and believed about post-war West Germany.
<P>
Devastated post-war Berlin was the essence of a zero-sum society.  History records that young men fought with senior citizens for food scraps in the ruins and trash bins.  The Reichsmark was all but abandoned and replaced by a so-called "Zigaretten Wirtschaft" or cigarette economy.  A carton of Lucky Strikes became the unit of account, food, construction costs, workers wages . . . just about everything was priced in cigarettes.  The German press speculated about a possible U.S. loan of 50 million cartons of cigarettes to support the worthless Reichsmark.
<P>
People were losing hope that life would ever rise above this bleak level.  In the United States there were worries that democracy itself would fail in Europe if prosperity could not be restored.  And then, suddenly, something happened.
<P>
A finance minister who had studied the classical writings of Smith and Ricardo came to the forefront.  In just a few strokes of incredible political courage and economic vision, Ludwig Erhard changed the course of German history, and thus Western hopes for reconstruction.
<P>
One day in June--the 20th of June, 1948--he reformed the currency by abolishing the Reichsmark and substituting the Deutschemark.  He crushed inflation by tying the new currency to the U.S. Dollar, which, in turn, was tied to the stable exchange rate system worked out at Bretton Woods and thus established the integrity of this new West German numeraire.
<P>
Henry Wallich, a one time U.S. Federal Reserve Board member, in his book<I> The Mainsprings of German Revival</I>, wrote, "The spirit of the country changed overnight.  The gray, hungry and dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their ever-lasting search for food came to life as, pocketing their 40 D-Marks, they went on their first spending spree."
<P>
On June 22, because inflation had pushed West German people into extremely high tax rates, Erhard indexed the tax brackets, dramatically lowering effective tax rates.  On July 7, he abolished rationing, canceled hundreds of regulations and eliminated wage and price controls, against the advice of the U.S. State Department and the military command.
<P>
According to the history books, within a year, West German workers were eating more and better food than those in austerity-ridden Britain, which had turned to a socialist government and, incidentally, received more Marshall aid money.
<P>
In two years, West Germany's real income increased 40 percent.  By 1952, her exports had risen 60 percent.  Over 12 years, from 1950 to 1962, while the U.S. GNP was increasing by a healthy 50%, West Germany's rose at a rate five times as great--247%.  Within a generation an autocratic nation twice defeated in the century's most destructive wars had become not only a world economic power, but a trusted friend and ally.
<P>
What caused this <I> Wirstchaftswunder-- </I>this economic miracle?  Well, first of all, it was not a miracle at all.  chancellor Adenauer and his Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, both said the Marshall plan had little to do with it.  It wasn't some government industrial policy.  It certainly wasn't a world bank or IMF-imposed austerity program.
<P>
Ludwig Erhard did not discover some magic formula or experience a sudden Utopian vision.  He simply, yet profoundly, applied the socially responsible free market prescriptions of classical supply-side economics.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>He established a stable currency and maintained its integrity as a storehouse of value and a unit of account.
<LI>He slashed tariffs and other trade barriers.
<LI>He allowed the markets to work freely in setting prices and wages, and in allocating resources by eliminating, in one bold stroke, all rationing and price controls.
<LI>He dramatically rescued the steeply graduated tax rates on working, saving, investing, and producing.
<LI>He applied orderly principles of law to private property, patents, and contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Erhard's reforms all rested on one fundamental principle of democracy:  that prosperity, wealth, and opportunity can only be created by people acting freely and entrepreneurially--by strengthening the people and their markets and relying on free enterprise--not government planning.
<P>
This is a message for Mexico and, indeed, every nation on earth:  The key to wealth and prosperity is allowing people freedom--freedom to work, to save, to trade, to succeed, and yes, to fail and yet try again.  The ultimate causes of wealth of nations are free people, free trade, and free enterprise.
<P>
This means preserving the value of people's money; not cheating them out of their savings through devaluation.  This will encourage them to save more.
<P>
This means defending their property rights through the rule of law, so the people need not fear the confiscation of the fruits of their labors.  This will encourage them to produce more.
<P>
This means taxing solely to raise revenues for the legitimate needs of the state, not to punish wealth and success to promote so-called egalitarian ends.
<P>
This means preserving the competition of the marketplace at all levels of enterprise, resisting the impulse to protect big business and state enterprise at the expense of young entrepreneurs who ultimately create most new wealth and new jobs.
<P>
These are the lessons we have learned in the West in the last two centuries, beginning with the linkage of Jeffersonian democracy and Adam Smith's economic system of natural liberty.  We have relearned and refined these lessons with Erhard's miracle in Germany, President Reagan's revolution in the United States, Margaret Thatcher's revitalization of Great Britain, Vaclav Klaus' success in the Czech Republic, and in the dramatic achievement of Asian economies.  Once started in motion, ideological momentum is difficult to stop.  Having achieved a victory in one place, it transcends borders and cultures and acquires a life of its own.
<P>
This is the genius of economic freedom from which every nation can benefit, both rich and poor, north and south.  No one succeeds at the expense of another.  Everyone benefits from their neighbor's prosperity.  It is the common ground on which to build a stable international community.  Protectionism yields conflict.  Economic freedom yields cooperation.  We create the conditions for peace throughout the advance of trade.
<P>
And that same freedom provides hope to nations that have lived too long without it.  Poverty is not an immutable condition.  Every nation is richly supplied with the most important natural resource--human creativity.  This is the seminal message of democratic capitalism's triumph:  growth is the product of individual effort, where the link between effort and reward is both preserved and promoted.
<P>
As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we should look once again at the 1944 conference of Bretton Woods.  The agreement at Bretton Woods successfully established an international monetary regime and helped promote free and open markets throughout most of the free world.  Ultimately, the agreement was responsible for unprecedented growth, prosperity, and trade.
<P>
Now with the end of the cold war, we have the perfect opportunity to have a new "Bretton Woods" international conference of the leading industrial and developed nations of the world to conclude the work begun at the G-7 in 1985 under Secretary James Baker.
<P>
But before that, the United States must get our own monetary house in order by re-establishing the U.S. Dollar as a reliable numeraire.  It must once again be as good as gold, which will have the effect of lowering interest rates.  As Utah Senator Bob Bennett pointed out, "For every one percent [interest rate] deduction on $4.5 trillion debt, that is $45 billion dollars in annual savings."  Furthermore, the U.S. must reduce the deficit not by raising taxes but through spending restraint and cuts, and tax-rate cuts.  I have been asked by the Republican leadership in Congress to chair a commission to restructure the tax system in the United States.  It is my goal to work toward a flatter, simpler, and fairer code which broadens the tax base and stimulates growth and capital formation.  This would strengthen the U.S. Dollar without requiring higher interest rates.
<P>
We should also immediately expand NAFTA to include Chile and other Latin American countries.  And it is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market.  We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left.
<P>
And fourth, restore the IMF to its original purpose, which was to manage the exchange rate system and provide short term balance payments assistance for developing nations.
<P>
Finally, we must remember that there are no limits to growth in our world--just frontiers waiting to be opened and opportunities waiting to be explored.  If the United States encourages those economic pioneers who cross those frontiers--with policies that favor enterprise over planning, sound money over devaluations, growth over austerity--it will play a leading role in the advance of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  It is a role that will not only serve the interests of the United States, but will help unleash the creative ingenuity and vast resources of the rest of the world as well and lead us to the peace and prosperity so long dreamed about by our founders.  We must remember the words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address to the British Parliament:  "We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings."  What a great challenge for us all to undertake.<P>

<P>
In August, at the end of a mind-numbing, daylong congressional hearing on welfare 
reform, Heritage Foundation Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> began his remarks.
<P>
"The `War on Poverty' has been an incredibly costly failure," he told the House 
Human Relations Subcommittee.
<P>
The "welfare state" is made up of some 75 programs targeted to low-income and 
poor Americans, with a total annual cost exceeding $324 billion; the nation 
has spent $5.3 trillion since the War on Poverty began, he said.
<P>
"What are the names of these programs? Do you have a listing of these programs?" 
interrupted the Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Harold Ford, Tennessee Democrat.
<P>
"They're listed in my testimony," said Mr. Rector, who went on to explain that 
the average tax-paying household spent $3,400 in 1993 to combat poverty and 
that by 1999, the nation could be spending $550 billion a year on welfare.
<P>
"I'm going to correct you now," Mr. Ford interrupted again. The subcommittee, 
he explained, was only interested in hearing about Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children (AFDC), food stamps, and Medicaid.
<P>
"With all due respect ... you are not going to come here to this committee 
and give us these numbers," Mr. Ford said. "You are not going to leave the 
public perception that we are spending all these billions and billions of dollars 
on welfare."
<P>

<P>

<P>
The above story was recalled in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/Wash_Times/">The Washington Times</a> in a major year-end feature 
on welfare reform. Despite Congressman Ford's denials, Heritage's Robert Rector 
is correct: The official Congressional Research Service includes more than 
80 distinct programs in its inventory of "means-tested"  federal welfare programs. 
<P>

Like others at Heritage, Rector spends much of his time challenging conventional 
wisdom. You can't "end welfare as we know it," he says, unless you first understand 
both the nature of poverty and the patchwork system cobbled together during 
the past 30 years to fight it. Rector is one of the few in Washington who understands 
both, and the "fix" he proposed in his August testimony - and in numerous speeches 
and talk-radio appearances throughout the year - can be seen in the House GOP's 
"Contract with America." As <a href="http://www.townhall.com/nationalreview/">National Review</a> described Rector's proposal in 
a Dec. 31, 1994, editorial: "The Heritage Foundation-inspired Talent-Faircloth 
bill takes 65 welfare programs with 10,000 pages of regulations and boils them 
down to one block grant with a short set of guiding principles." The rest of 
the story will be written in 1995.
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

<P>

Throughout 1994, Heritage Foundation analysts repeatedly challenged both the 
conventional wisdom and the status quo. 
<P>
In a few instances, Heritage's role was primarily that of honest critic. The 
administration's crime bill, for example, almost failed after Heritage's Scott 
Hodge examined the fine print and found that the bulk of the funds would be 
spent on spurious "crime prevention" measures, such as arts and crafts and 
midnight basketball leagues. Heritage also was a vigorous critic of the administration's 
health-care plan, its re-regulation of the economy, its misguided foreign policy, 
and the haphazard way in which it has reduced defense spending.
<P>
In most cases, Heritage analysts were ready with concrete alternatives to the 
flawed proposals. The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, for example, provided 
Washington with a principled private-sector solution to America's health-care 
problems - a solution that would increase the choices available to most Americans 
while still helping to control medical costs. Heritage's foreign-policy blueprint, 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>,"  brought to international affairs a sense 
of mission and purpose lacking in the administration's foreign policy. Heritage's 
updated prosperity plan for America, "Putting Families First" - a comprehensive 
program for strengthening family finances, promoting capital expansion, and 
balancing the budget - served as the basis of the alternative budget offered 
by congressional Republicans. And "The Index of Economic Freedom," released 
at year end, not only showed how the U.S. foreign aid program has gone astray, 
but offered a focused free-market approach to revitalizing the wasteful program.
<P>

<P>

There were even instances when the administration and The Heritage Foundation 
found themselves in agreement. John M. Olin Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/cobb.htm">Joe Cobb</a>, for example, 
played a pivotal role in the debate over the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and was publicly credited by both the White House and the media 
with helping to blunt protectionist attacks on the global trade pact.
<P>
Throughout its 21-year history, The Heritage Foundation has always tried to 
make a difference. As the following stories show, the entire Heritage organization 
- research; government, media, and business relations; the lectures and seminars 
program; Policy Review; and Heritage's more than 200,000 community ambassadors: 
its members - all play a role in Heritage's efforts to change the direction 
of public policy. Sometimes, the entire organization may be involved in a project. 
Other times, a single analyst or a single study - when properly marketed to 
key members of Congress and the right mix of media opinion-leaders - can change 
the course of the debate.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>t's a <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>rime</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress's bitter summer debate over the administration's crime bill, for example, 
might never have taken place if it weren't for the tenacity of Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">Bill 
Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.  
<P>
When the anti-crime package was first introduced, the bill was expected to 
sail through both houses of Congress by wide margins. After all, with drug-related 
street crime running rampant in most urban areas, what politician wanted to 
be seen as an opponent of crime control? Then Bennett, the former Secretary 
of Education and U.S. drug czar, and Hodge, Heritage's Grover M. Hermann Fellow 
in Federal Budgetary Affairs, took a closer look at the proposal. 
<P>
Bennett, the first public figure to criticize the proposal, found that the 
federal government was once again usurping the power and authority of state 
and local government. Hodge's analysis struck closer to home. Rather than put 
100,000 new police officers on America's streets, as the administration claimed, 
Hodge found that the crime bill would finance only 20,000 police officers - 
leaving state and local government with the rest of the tab. [A subsequent 
Heritage study showed each state exactly how much.] The remainder of the more 
than $30 billion Congress was being asked to approve, Hodge's analysis showed, 
was earmarked for various "crime prevention" initiatives - urban pork - that 
duplicated existing programs, none of which had done much to deter crime. 
<P>
Hodge's findings were marketed aggressively to the news media and immediately 
vaulted to the top of talk radio's list of hottest topics. Critics on Capitol 
Hill quickly joined the fray, and support for the legislation went into free 
fall - all because of a single study that looked beyond the rhetoric at the 
details. So compelling were the Heritage data that the White House communications 
office issued a formal rebuttal in an effort to discredit Heritage's analysis. 
This prompted several reporters to do some homework of their own. To the great 
consternation of the White House, they found that Hodge was correct. As a Harris 
poll later confirmed, a majority of the public got the Heritage message: the 
crime bill was more about pork than about fighting crime. 
<P>
The White House effort to discredit Heritage failed - and the crime bill nearly 
failed with it. In the end, the legislation was approved by a very narrow margin, 
but congressional pork-busters are revisiting the bill in 1995.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's involvement in the health-care debate began in 1989 before there 
was a national health-care debate. Since the publication of that original Heritage 
Foundation monograph, "A National Health System for America" (Stuart M. Butler 
and Edmund F. Haislmaier, editors), Heritage has published more than 50 papers 
on the various problems plaguing the health financing system and the proposals 
- good and bad - for fixing those problems. During the summer of 1994, for 
example, as Congress rushed ahead with alternatives to the mortally wounded 
Clinton Health Security Act,  Heritage's research team worked around the clock 
to offer detailed analyses of proposed alternatives. In one three-week period 
in August, Heritage published and publicized 12 different studies detailing 
the serious problems with various health-care proposals.
<P>
In the end,  the entire effort to increase the government's control over health 
care in America collapsed. The final chapter was a war of words over which 
reform plan would give ordinary Americans the same kind of health coverage 
enjoyed by government officials. 
<P>
It was a war Heritage's analysts and media specialists had spent all year preparing 
for - because only Heritage could win this war. As Heritage asked in a widely 
published advertisement: "Hillary Rodham Clinton Has It. George Stephanopoulos 
Has It. Donna Shalala and all Cabinet Members Have It. Ted Kennedy Has It. 
So Why Can't All Americans Have What They Have?" 
<P>


What they have, we explained, is "a health benefits system that allows them 
to choose among dozens of competing health-care insurers and providers, works 
with a minimum of regulation ... and because it relies on the principles of 
choice and competition, has successfully controlled costs." This was important 
because just one reform proposal, the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan 
(and its legislative version, the Nickles-Stearns Consumer Choice Health Security 
Act), was similar in design to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program 
(FEHBP). 
<P>
In truth, FEHBP is a government program in name only; all benefits are provided 
by private insurers who compete with one another for business. By focusing 
attention on FEHBP - in hundreds of radio talk-show appearances, speeches, 
congressional Town Hall meetings, Capitol Hill briefings, and newspaper editorial 
board meetings - Heritage experts were able not only to point to an existing 
market-based system that works, but to demonstrate the insincerity of Washington 
officials who would impose a government-run system on most Americans while 
retaining a consumer-based system for themselves.
<P>

<P>
With time running out, most major sponsors of reform legislation - including 
President Clinton, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), and other backers of government-run 
health care - had no choice but to claim their proposals' kinship to FEHBP, 
even if it wasn't true. Those who had been closely following the health-care 
debate knew better; only the Heritage plan - based on the principles of individual 
choice and market competition  - followed the successful model.
<P>
While support for the other reform plans withered as the details became better 
known, support for the Heritage approach increased as details became more widely 
known. The support was as broad as it was deep. Some 25 members of the Senate 
and an equal number of House members co-sponsored the Nickles-Stearns bill. 
The Heritage approach also was endorsed by several state medical societies, 
a national association of nursing homes, and more than 150 newspapers, magazines, 
and columnists. Meanwhile, some 700 individual doctors became personal advocates 
of the consumer-choice plan as members of the Heritage Foundation Physician's 
Council.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">B</FONT>ottoms <FONT SIZE = "+2">U</FONT>p</H3></CENTER>
<P>
When Heritage defense analysts <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> and John Luddy warned in March 
that the Clinton administration had underfunded its own defense plan, the so-called 
"Bottom-Up Review," by a five-year total of $100 billion, the White House and 
Pentagon cried foul.
<P>
A few months later, they - and the rest of Washington - discovered that The 
Heritage Foundation is true to its word when it describes itself as a "conservative" 
think tank. Congress's auditing arm, the General Accounting Office (GAO), took 
its own look at the mismatch between the administration's defense plan and 
the Pentagon budget and found that Heritage's $100 billion estimate had been 
very conservative. The shortfall, GAO said, was closer to $150 billion.
<P>
After the GOP takeover of Congress - which catapulted two long-time friends 
of Heritage's,  Sen. Strom Thurmond and Rep. Floyd Spence, South Carolina Republicans, 
into the chairmanship of the Senate and House Armed Services committees - the 
administration suddenly "got religion" and admitted that the defense budget 
would have to be increased substantially in order to maintain military readiness. 
The increase the administration proposed was inadequate, but at least it was 
a start.
<P>
Heritage's analysts, meanwhile, continued to identify billions of dollars in 
non-defense pork that had been buried in the defense budget. Defense spending, 
no doubt, will be a major policy issue in 1995. 
<P>

<P>
From the crush of reporters and the bank of television cameras lined up in 
the long, rectangular room, you would have thought that President Clinton or 
Pope John Paul II was present. Instead, the star attraction was a radio talk-show 
host. Not any talk-show host, mind you, but the king: Rush Limbaugh.
<P>
The occasion was The Heritage Foundation's orientation conference for newly 
elected members of the 104th Congress. For many of the more than 65 new members 
of the House and Senate who attended the three-day (Dec. 8-10) Baltimore conference, 
co-sponsored with Empower America, the conference was more like a family reunion. 
They already knew Heritage. One new congressman told <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> he had refined 
his political philosophy over the years by reading <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, Heritage's 
quarterly journal. Many of the others had used Heritage research during their 
campaigns.
<P>
No election in recent memory was more about issues and ideas than the contests 
that took place on Nov. 8, 1994. The House GOP's "Contract with America" - 
attacked by liberals throughout the campaign - provided voters with a concrete 
list of institutional and policy changes. As a number of reporters noted, many 
of the proposals had been seen before - in Heritage books and policy papers.
<P>
True to their promise, Congress's new Republican majority used the first day 
of the 104th Congress to perform surgery on the Congress itself. The "Contract 
with America" had promised a series of far-reaching changes "aimed at restoring 
the faith and trust of the American people in government." Virtually every 
one of these sweeping institutional changes - including a measure that would 
apply all U.S. laws to the Congress itself - had been proposed in Heritage's 
1993 book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class</a>," and fleshed out in subsequent Heritage papers. 

<P>
As Seattle talk-show host Mike Siegel reminded his listeners in a week-long 
series of broadcasts from Heritage's radio studio the week after the election, 
the Heritage recipe for reforming Congress had been a popular staple on talk 
radio throughout 1994. Now these proposals - embraced by millions of ordinary 
Americans while bitterly opposed by much of official Washington - had made 
their way back to the Nation's Capital, and a new revolution in government 
had begun.

<P>
What follows is a report on the people and programs that make The Heritage 
Foundation an American original. 
<P>

<p>


None of the programs should be viewed in a vacuum. The wide range of activities 
is possible only because of the encouragement and active support of Heritage's 
donors. In a city long dominated by the liberal left, Heritage's research papers 
command attention not just because they are timely and thorough, but because 
they are  professionally marketed and always on the mark. And Heritage's lectures 
and seminars, Policy Review and the Resource Bank all help widen the conservative 
circle. 
<P>

<p>
The Heritage Foundation's continuing efforts to build a better America and 
a safer world involve more than 150 dedicated employees and more than 200,000 
members who express their confidence each year by providing the financial support 
that has helped Heritage make a difference for 21 years. n

He correctly identifies many serious problems - species extinction, population pressures, aquifer depletion - in his book, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;.</P><P>     Unfortunately, although he gets many facts straight, his proposed reforms are likely to be genuinely harmful; he has learned little from history. Gore sees the problem as evil and ignorant people and insufficient government management. His approach to environmental bliss is naive - place good, intelligent people in positions of authority and empower them to pursue rational, publicly beneficial policies. He assumes that political bureaucracies can consistently promote environmental ends. While this may work at the community level, it normally fails at the national level as both ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency are trumped by politics.</P><P>     Gore's policy inclinations are right in the trivial sense that many environmental problems could easily be dealt with if we could &quot;rewire&quot; people and produce a new environmental man. This creature would enthusiastically support programs that improved the quality of the environment, even if they implied significant personal costs. Environmental man's self interest is subservient to ecology. But this is as unrealistic as the Soviet's efforts to create a &quot;new socialist man,&quot; another altruistic creature. And like the Soviet's efforts, rewiring - or in this case repainting people a new shade of green - will fail, causing much environmental mischief and fostering political opportunism.</P><P>     The key to environmental protection is not reliance upon more extensive political micromanagement. Neither is it dependence upon good people in high places or mass conversion to a more ecologically responsible perspective. True, my fellow conservationists and I would rest easier if we could count upon having people such as Aldo Leopold, a profound social observer and a founder of wildlife science, as Interior Secretary. And yes, I'd be delighted if voters shared my views and joined in mass support of The Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited.</P><P>     But in reality, no society has learned how to identify Platonic despots, i.e., people who will wisely and disinterestedly safeguard the public good. Likewise, mass political movements that inspire sacrifice and achieve sustained, dedicated support normally generate horrid results. Castro, Franco, Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin are but extreme examples of the corruption inherent to centralized power.</P><P>     The temptations to abuse power are enormous in environmental policy and elsewhere. If we accept Gore's approach, with its heavy reliance on good intentions, good people and strong government, we invite abuses. Good people will not always be in top positions and ordinary people will not always act in environmentally beneficial ways. As America's founders clearly explained, government power is likely to be misdirected. Political management and ecological sustainability are not complementary for several reasons.</P><P>     The most important reason is that a politician must capture campaign contributions to survive. This means he typically must favor his constituents over the national interest. The greater the government's role in the economy, the more costly it is to neglect one's voters in favor of the public interest in the environment.</P><P>     We can learn this lesson from federal agencies such as the Forest Service (1897), Bureau of Reclamation (1902) and Park Service (1906). The creators of these agencies, the first Progressives, expected good people to use scientific principles to publicly manage natural resources. But as the power of these agencies grew, so did the subsidized abuse to Western environments and citizens. Gore seems not to understand that these earlier efforts failed because their incentives were perverse and the information they generated was of poor quality.</P><P>     Gore has taken the important first step of recognizing our environmental ills. But like the progressive reformers of a century ago, he has misdiagnosed the causes and hence the cures. A few in the Clinton administration, including Browner but excluding Babbitt, seem to understand the importance of property rights and incentives to a greener future. I'm afraid that if Gore doesn't learn these lessons and we follow his lead, we will have the worst of all worlds: ineffective environmental protection, inefficient economics and a citizenry disenchanted with environmental causes. The trick is to harmonize economics with ecology. Unfortunately, Gore hasn't learned it.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

<title>Gary Bauer's January, 1997 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

January 3, 1997

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

On January 22, our nation will mark the 24th anniversary of the
Supreme Court decisions that elevated a choice for death to the
level of national policy.  In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and its companion
case, <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, seven men dressed in black robes delivered
a cruel blow that continues to reverberate throughout our land.
Those seven Justices, arrogant and unelected, elevated abortion
on demand to a status of grand Constitutional privilege.  The
chilling effects of their ruling have not stopped even to this
day, as a culture of death continues to descend across this good
and decent land.

<p>

Just how deeply a nation can sink into a depraved indifference
to human life was vividly illustrated recently in Delaware.  There,
prosecutors charge, two unwed college students -- Brian Peterson,
Jr. and Amy Grossberg -- entered a hotel for the express purpose
of giving birth to their firstborn son.  What happened next, prosecutors
say, is horrible to contemplate.  On a cold November night, the
child was placed in a plastic bag and dropped outside in the hotel
dumpster, where maintenance workers later found his body.  The
dead baby had a fractured skull and other injuries that the coroner
attributes to blunt-force head trauma and shaking.

<p>

Reaction to this case has been extraordinary.  Many columnists
have noted the fact that Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are
among those society would call its &quot;fortunate souls.&quot;
They come from well-to-do families; they have had the best of
everything.  As the <I>New York Times</I> reported it, they &quot;grew
up where many teenagers have their own cars and secure futures,
where gardeners tend landscaped lawns and shrubs[.]&quot;[1] They
do not live in some remote, forsaken corner of the world, or in
a culture where out-of-wedlock childbearing is rare or scorned.
They come from prosperous families in a populous state (New Jersey),
at a time when unwed pregnancy is so common that, apparently,
no one at Amy Grossberg's college even discussed with her the
fact that she was clearly on the verge of childbirth.

<p>

These young people are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence,
of course, so we will withhold our judgment about what happened
in that hotel room.  But we don't have to wait to react to what
is being said about their case by the swarms of psychologists
and lawyers now descending on Delaware.  Getting at the truth
seems far down on the list of priorities for these apologists.
One commentator regretted that Peterson and Grossberg had not
gone to New Jersey's local Planned Parenthood, where their problem
could have been averted by the nation's largest abortion provider.
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has led the fight
to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform, talked
vaguely about the couple's failure to consider adoption and &quot;other
options.&quot;  Charles Oberly, Amy Grossberg's attorney, with
no hint that he was merely trying to shift the blame to Peterson,
told <I>The New York Times</I> that &quot;[t]here is a serious
question whether this woman did anything criminal.&quot;[2]

<p>

Now, it may be true that both of these privileged young adults
are &quot;all-American kids.&quot;  It may be, as their lawyer
claims, that they were panic-stricken and irrational to the point
of insanity in that hotel room.  But it might also be the case
that they engaged in an act of calculated rationality.  Columnist
George Will put his finger on this exactly when he pointed out
how, under only slightly different circumstances, Peterson and
Grossberg could have found themselves visiting the White House
for a veto ceremony instead of standing before a grand jury in
Delaware. &quot;Don't young people read newspapers?&quot; he
wrote. &quot;Don't they know that, thanks to President Clinton,
they could have <I>chosen</I> to have a doctor suck their baby's
brains out, and Delaware would not have <I>chosen</I> to charge
them with murder?&quot;[3]

<p>

In the world in which we now live, it is surely possible that
two 18-year-olds could not see the logical and rational difference
between dropping their baby boy into a dumpster and dropping by
the New Jersey clinic that has performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions
in a single year.  And if there is no rational difference between
these two actions, why then would society insist on punishment
for the one deed and presidential praise for the right to do the
other?

<p>

This is where the abortion culture has led us in January 1997.
On the 8th of this month, the Supreme Court of the United States
will hear a case that will determine whether or not there is an
individual constitutional right to commit suicide with the aid
of another.  Lawyers for our side, including FRC's own Cathy Cleaver,
have argued strenuously in legal briefs to the court not only
that no such right exists, but that to invent it would be to open
the floodgates to the wholesale &quot;termination&quot; of the
elderly and severely handicapped.  We have many allies on this
issue -- and compelling arguments -- but at this writing we are
keenly aware that the odds are against us: the Supreme Court is
radically liberal on social issues, and both federal appeals courts
in this case have held that the states may not restrict assisted
suicide.

<p>

In Michigan, Jack Kevorkian has claimed at least 45 victims. 
This pathological ex-pathologist, whose obsession with death includes
painting pictures that feature Nazi images and human cannibalism,
has so far evaded the condemnation of jurors.  The media depicts
him as a hero and trail-blazer.  He depicts himself as a latter-day
Thomas Jefferson, while conveniently forgetting all the while
the words of Jefferson, who said that &quot;[t]he care of human
life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the sole legitimate
object of good government.&quot;

<p>

How then can we restore respect for the sanctity of human life?
The Family Research Council is determined to do its part.  We
will continue to battle in the courts, as we have done in opposing
assisted suicide and defending the right of pro-life sidewalk
counselors to offer aid to those entering abortion clinics.[4] We
will continue to address our case to the Congress, urging the
adoption of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions and to
provide legal protection for human life from conception until
natural death.  And we will keep the pressure on Bill Clinton
and Al Gore to reverse their pro-abortion policies.  As long as
we have breath in us to speak, we will remind those in office
of their sacred duty to defend the weak and the helpless.

<p>

We will also continue to conduct research and to publish analysis,
both legal and social, of the key issues under debate.  This month,
we are releasing two more contributions to this effort.  Gracie
Hsu and Robert G. Morrison of my staff have joined with me in
preparing a comprehensive statement on the sanctity of human life.
We approached this task humbly, knowing that many great writers
and thinkers have addressed this subject more powerfully than
we ever could.  Still, we believe that Americans need a constant
recalling to the faith and vision of our founders and to the lessons
of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

<p>

It has been said over and over again that the abortion industry
is the most unregulated commercial enterprise in American history.
When a New Jersey newspaper revealed, as noted above, that a
clinic there had performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions in a
single year, it reported a startling fact that no power in state
government knew or wanted to know.  The information currently
being gathered about the number of abortions performed in America
and the harm these abortions do to women is woefully inadequate.
You can use the enclosed reply card to obtain a copy of FRC's
Special Report, <I>A Woman's Right (Not) to Know</I>, by Virginia
Delegate Robert G. Marshall.

<p>

January, of course, also marks the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr.  His speech at the Lincoln Memorial still resonates
throughout every corner of this land, too, because he invoked
the &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to life, liberty and happiness
that belong to all people not by virtue of their skin color or
utility, but by virtue of their humanity.  That humanity is holy
because it reflects the image and likeness of our Creator, a Creator
who loves us &quot;irrationally&quot; -- not according to our
merits or usefulness to Him -- but because he has <I>chosen</I>
to love us.

<p>

How like that love the noblest human love is.  I think of the
woman in our area of Virginia a few years back, who came home
to find her family's trailer ablaze.  Knowing that her two children
were inside, she rushed into the inferno to save them.  A firefighter
who tried to restrain her said that she was on fire the moment
she passed through the trailer door.  Her body was found outside
the room where the bodies of her two sons lay. <I>Irrational love.</I>

<p>

Or the heartrending footnote to that searing story of the young
boy in the Chicago housing project who was thrown to his death
from an upper floor by two 12-year-olds because he refused to
steal candy for them.  That act of gross disrespect for human
life was matched by the impossible act of love displayed by the
dead boy's 5-year-old brother, who raced down the stairs of the
high rise immediately after the incident.  Asked by a counselor
what was going through his mind, the little boy said he had hoped
to catch his brother before he hit the ground.  <I>Irrational
love.</I>

<p>

Or, finally, the young police officer in Tennessee, struck by
a bullet in the line of duty, who lay in a &quot;persistent vegetative
state.&quot;  (That's an awful term for a physical condition that
none of us can fully comprehend.)  One day, after several years
of this coma-like condition, the officer awoke for a brief time,
recognized his children, and spoke to them.  His brother rushed
to the hospital to be with him.  When the press asked the brother
what his reaction was to so many years of waiting and worrying,
he said that it was worth it all just to be able to tell his brother
that he loved him, and to be understood.

<p>

My friends, these are acts of irrational love -- performed out
of profound, reflexive respect for the sanctity of human life.
All around us in 1997, there are signs that affirm this kind
of love, but unfortunately there are also many other signs that
tell us we have lost our way -- a way of service and sacrifice
on behalf of those who desperately need us.

<p>

In the days to come, let us all pray that our Supreme Court, our
Congress and our President will recover their sense of direction
and help this nation, once again, become a beacon to the oppressed,
a Shining City on a Hill.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  As always, your partnership with us is essential to our
success.  We thank God for all you do to make our work possible.
Your generosity and your prayers, your friendship and notes of
encouragement -- these things mean more to me that you will ever
know. I pray that you and your family will enjoy all of God's blessings
in 1997.

<title>EA ISSUE BRIEFING</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
</center>
<blockquote><P> 
For the past thirty years, affirmative-action policies have contributed to the 
balkanization of America by race, sex and ethnicity.   The original intent of these 
policies -- to redress past discrimination -- was a noble one, but the means of redress 
have been fundamentally flawed and the real-life consequences disastrous.  It is time 
to stop counting by race and to re-dedicate this nation to the proposition that we are 
a color-blind society.<p>    

To be sure, racism and discrimination are still ugly stains on the American 
landscape, and where they occur, we should use existing laws to stamp them out.   
But affirmative action as a remedy has outrun its course.  If we continue to count by 
race, hire by race, and admit by race, we will divide by race.  We must renew our 
commitment to the American ideal that we are one people:<i> e pluribus unum</i>.  The 
best way to achieve a color-blind society is actually to be a color-blind society, in law 
and in spirit.<p>

<B>Recent Developments</B><br>
Despite President Clinton's morally bankrupt defense of all federal affirmative-
action programs, public opposition to quotas and the institutionalized 
discrimination of affirmative action programs continues to mount.  Moreover, 
several recent developments have dealt powerful blows to federal policies and 
programs that count by race.<p>  

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in Adarand Constructors v. Pena that federal 
affirmative action programs must meet a standard of &quot;strict scrutiny.&quot;  Under the 
strict-scrutiny standard, the federal government must demonstrate that an 
affirmative-action program is narrowly tailored to redress identifiable past 
discrimination.  Few of the existing affirmative-action programs meet that test. 

In July, Congress introduced &quot;The Equality of Opportunity Act of 1995,&quot; which 
prohibits the federal government from taking race, gender, or ethnicity into account 
in its employment or contracting practices, or in the implementation of any federally 
conducted program or activity. The &quot;Equality of Opportunity Act&quot; is an important 
piece of legislation that, if passed, will guarantee all Americans justice and equal 
treatment under  the law.<p>

Empower America is also a strong supporter of the California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which should appear on the statewide ballot as a referendum in 
November of 1996.   The Civil Rights Initiative prohibits the state of California from 
using race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for discriminating 
against, or giving preferential treatment to, any individual. <p>  

In dismantling the racially divisive programs of affirmative action, it is important 
for conservatives to be principled, not opportunistic:  We still need to reach out to 
disadvantaged Americans, especially those living in our inner-cities.  To this end,  
Empower America supports measures that will expand opportunities to the inner-
city poor, including tenant- management housing, empowerment zones, and school 
choice.  We also support redesigning the tax code to make possible broader 
ownership of capital, savings, and credit in the minority community.   Expansion of 
opportunity is necessary to ensure equality of opportunity.<p>

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Marketing -- Heritage</TITLE>

<CENTER><B>Popularizing Conservative Ideas</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>


<P>
On Nov. 8, 1994, a conservative tide swept across America - opening a new chapter 
in the political revolution launched by President Reagan 14 years earlier.
<P>
The White House, national news media, and Washington's liberal establishment 
were surprised by both the depth and the breadth of the conservative victory. 
They were even more surprised, however, by something else: that the voters 
both understood and supported the ideas proposed during the campaign by conservative 
candidates. 
<P>
They shouldn't have been surprised. Many of the specific proposals had been 
developed at The Heritage Foundation, and almost all of them had been time-tested 
in the court of public opinion: in speeches to business and civic groups, in 
congressional Town Hall meetings, in op-ed page articles, and on talk radio. 
Maybe the Washington establishment didn't appreciate the common-sense appeal 
of the conservative policy agenda, but the voters did.
<P>
Since 1973, The Heritage Foundation has served a dual role: both as an idea 
factory and as a product-testing laboratory. The first role - policy research, 
development, and innovation - is the purpose of Heritage's ongoing research 
program. The equally important second role of popularizing and legitimizing 
Heritage Foundation policy prescriptions and the broader conservative vision 
of government is the mandate of Heritage's marketing program. 
<P>
This emphasis on marketing to Congress and the Executive Branch, the national 
and international news media, state government officials, and the business, 
academic, and policy communities is one of the things that makes Heritage different 
from other policy institutes. As a USA Today headline put it in a post-election 
feature about Heritage, "The Think Tank: Foundation bringing vision back to 
the future."
<p>


<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">G</FONT>overnment <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>elations</H3></CENTER>
<P>
On November 21, two weeks after the election, Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government announced it had cancelled its "Introduction to 
Congress" class in December. The Ivy League university had held the course 
for newly elected members of Congress for 22 years.  In 1994, there wasn't 
much interest in what the Harvard faculty might have to say. Instead, most 
congressional freshmen attended The Heritage Foundation's orientation program 
in Baltimore.
<P>
The Economist modestly called the change "a sign of the times." Earlier in 
the year, in its Jan. 7, 1994, issue, The Economist had forecast such a shift. 
"In the 1960s it looked as if universities would establish a monopoly over 
the life of the mind, providing policies for politicians, sinecures for writers, 
ideas for journalists and breakthroughs for industrialists." The 1980s, The 
Economist observed, "changed all that." Now, the editors wrote, governments 
in search of advice increasingly look "to think tanks such as the Institute 
of Economic Affairs in Britain and the Heritage Foundation in Washington, rather 
than to Oxford or Harvard." 
<P>

From the beginning, Congress - which has the constitutional authority to pass 
laws, ratify treaties, declare war, and approve spending - has been Heritage's 
primary audience. The government relations staff serves as an institutional 
link between the Heritage research team and the policymaking community, providing 
Congress and the Executive Branch with timely information and policy recommendations 
on matters of current interest.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>andidate <FONT SIZE = "+2">E</FONT>ducation</H3></CENTER>
<P>
With an important national election ahead, Heritage welcomed the 1994 political 
season with its 296-page candidates' briefing book, "Issues '94." The book 
was distributed free of charge to incumbents and challengers alike.  
<P>
Dozens of House and Senate candidates and several gubernatorial candidates, 
including George Pataki, who unseated New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, used the briefing 
book. As one successful congressional challenger, Ron Lewis (R-KY), wrote, 
"Heritage provided the best, most accurate facts and figures that I used in 
my campaign. They were right on target every time."
<P>

<P>

Heritage's efforts to provide policy guidance to future members of the 104th 
Congress didn't cease with the election. Most successful candidates had promised 
to challenge the status quo and cut Washington down to size. The three-day 
orientation conference offered by Heritage and Empower America provided a game 
plan for doing just that, with sessions on family tax relief, federal mandates 
and federalism, farm policy reform, fighting crime, congressional reform, health 
care, foreign policy, welfare reform, rebuilding America's defenses, the environmental 
activists' "green agenda," and cutting government. addition to the many Heritage 
analysts on the program, the list of speakers included Heritage Distinguished 
Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-WY),  Rep. W.J. 
"Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton 
Dunlop, Kemper Financial Services Senior Economist John Silvia, John DiIulio 
of The Brookings Institution, Rep. Cal Dooley (D-CA), former U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, and talk show superstar Rush Limbaugh, 
who was named an "Honorary Member" of the 104th Congress's freshman class. 
<P>

<P>
Seven years of intense, focused effort which included two landmark books and 
dozens of articles, papers, and seminars was rewarded in 1994 as House Republicans 
embraced most of the institutional reforms proposed by Heritage's U.S. Congress 
Assessment Project staff.
<P>
The 1988 Heritage book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>," launched the debate. Something 
is terribly wrong with Congress, the book argued, and it needs to be fixed. 
As just one example, the book listed more than a dozen federal laws, including 
the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Minimum Wage Act, 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Freedom of Information Act, Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, and Ethics in Government Act, 
from which Congress had exempted itself.
<P>
All of the specific reforms approved by Congress on Jan. 4-5, 1995, can be 
found in the pages of "The Imperial Congress," the 1993 Heritage sequel, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The 
Ruling Class</a>," or in the many papers produced in 1994 and prior years by David 
Mason and the "Congress Project" staff. For example, at the top of House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's list of reforms was a promise, spelled out in the "Contract 
with America," to make "all laws that apply to the rest of the country also 
apply equally to the Congress." The new majority also moved to reduce the number 
of congressional committees and subcommittees, cut committee staff, limit the 
terms of committee chairs, open committee meetings to the public, and eliminate 
the phony "baseline budgeting" scam, which for years had allowed Washington 
to act as if it were cutting spending when it really was increasing it.
<P>

<P>

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">G</FONT>overnors' <FONT SIZE = "+2">F</FONT>orum</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Heritage's Governors' Forum continued its efforts in 1994 to involve governors 
and state administrators more directly in federal policy decisions affecting 
their states. With the new Congress promising to return many government functions 
to the states, the program in 1995 will increase its emphasis on the concept 
of federalism.
<P>

<P>
Just two years old, the program already is seen as a major national forum. 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, for example, appeared at Heritage just days after 
his come-from-behind reelection. Seen by some as the start of a potential 1996 
presidential bid, his hard-hitting speech addressed the imbalance between state 
and federal government and how state executives can help take back some of 
the powers wrongly assumed by Washington. Other Governors' Forum speakers in 
1994 included former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Virginia Gov. George Allen 
Jr., and Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4>A BIPARTISAN ECONOMIC AGENDA<BA>

<P>
Op-Ed by Jack Kemp
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2>as printed in The Wall Street Journal, June 18, 1996<BA>
</center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
A year ago, when I announced that I would not seek the republican presidential nomination, I had hoped that the broad field of candidates in the GOP would produce a clear consensus on how the next Republican president would usher America into the 21st century.  Americans had gone to the polls in 1994 and rejected special-interest politics.  By electing the new Republican majority to Congress, voters sent a clear and loud signal that they wanted its leaders to stop clinging to the past and begin moving America forward again.
<P> 
Unfortunately, since that landmark election, we Republicans have seemed unable to escape our old conventional wisdom.  The dialogue within my party has focused on patching up a hopelessly flawed tax code, and even that discussion is hamstrung by our self-defeating preoccupation with the federal budget deficit. 
<P>
<B>Deeper Maladies</B> 
<P>
It is not that deficits don't matter, they emphatically do--in the same way that a high fever matters.  Both are symptoms of much deeper maladies.  In the case of deficits, the real malady is the anemic rate of growth in the economy and a political system that has lost the ability to set national priorities.  It is not enough just to say that government is too big and that it overspends.  The problem is that the economy isn't growing fast enough to accommodate the level of spending produced through the democratic process. 
<P>
In a recent essay on this page ("Recipe for Growth," April 11), Felix Rohatyn suggested that the first step toward reviving robust economic growth is to forge an entente between the parties, centered on an agreement that increasing economic growth is our nation's highest and first priority.  I agree.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if both parties were debating how to double the rate of economic growth rather than seeing who can get the most tax credits and targeted tax cuts into the existing Internal Revenue Code? 
<P>
Mr. Rohatyn offers the following suggestion to the Democratic Party:  Stop using the federal tax system to redistribute income from the "haves" to the "have nots."  He appeals to his fellow Democrats to shift their focus to growing the economy so that the "have nots" have more. 
<P>
To Republicans, I humbly suggest that we make it possible for Democrats to give up their quest for redistribution of income and wealth by our acceptance of an appropriate role for government in financing those public goods and services necessary to secure a social safety net below which no American would be allowed to fall.  Equally important, we must agree on rebuilding a ladder of hope and opportunity that all our people can climb to reach their full potential.
<P>
The huge government bureaucracy we now confront was created over the last 60 years with good intentions, but with a redistributionist philosophy that led to counterproductive results.  In the face of this reality, we Republicans make a serious mistake when we try to economize first on social programs.  It allows us to be characterized as putting the "cart" of fiscal austerity before the "horse" of rapid economic growth. 
<P>
Yes, a number of programs need to be eliminated, many need to be restructured, and there are a multitude of things government does that it should not be doing.  But determining which programs to cut or eliminate or restructure should be undertaken within the context of determining what is the proper role of government and how government should fulfill that role. 
<P>
So, if I were advising the next president, I would recommend that he not ask Congress to fiddle with, adjust or patch up the current tax code.  Any attempt to fix it up around the edges will only reopen old partisan wounds and invite groups with vested interests in the current system to swarm the halls of Congress.  Let's not patch the current tax system, let's replace it. 
<P>
It should come as no surprise that, as co-author of the Kemp-Roth tax rate reduction plan around which Ronald Reagan built his economic growth agenda, I would support proposals to cut income tax rates across the board.  In my opinion, however, any tax bill the new president sends to Congress must be enacted within the first 100 days of his new administration so that the key congressional committees can clear the decks for the historic task of writing a new system from scratch.  A more drawn-out process of tinkering with "down payments," such as tax credits and targeted tax cuts, will drain too much energy from the new congress and in all likelihood will lead again to an inconclusive result.  Such tinkering might even prevent the necessary restructuring of the tax system. 
<P>
The real way for the new president to make a down payment on tax reform and get the economy growing rapidly again would be by issuing two complementary executive orders.  First, the president should instruct the Treasury secretary to index against inflation the treatment of capital gains, retroactively as well as prospectively.  This action would instantly remove the tax liabilities on several trillion dollars worth of capital assets--mostly farm and real property but also including considerable financial assets held long term--that are purely the result of inflation and are not real capital gains at all.  While there remains a partisan dispute over the treatment of genuine capital gains, there has been broad bipartisan agreement that inflated gains should not be taxed. 
<P>
Second, the new president should instruct the Treasury secretary to stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band, as a critical first step toward restoring sound money to America.  This action would reinstate the dollar/gold link that was broken in 1971, which led to the most severe run of inflation in our nation's history.
<P>
The new president would find significant support for this move both in Congress and at the Fed.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated repeatedly that he places a high value on gold as an indicator of inflation expectations.  This move would pave the way for Congress to enact Sen. Connie Mack's (R., Fla.) complimentary legislation establishing price-level stability as the Federal reserve's sole objective and requiring the Fed to establish explicit indicators by which to achieve this objective. 
<P>
Restoring the dollar/gold link is the surest proven method of taking the risk out of the dollar and all other government debt.  It has long been my belief that it will never be possible to balance the federal budget without some kind of dollar/gold link.  For every percentage point that interest rates fall, the federal government would have more than $50 billion a year in interest outlays on its current $5.1 trillion national debt.  That means we could save $1 trillion in debt-service costs during the next decade by refinancing the national debt at the much lower interest rates that would result when the risk of inflation was removed from the dollar. 
<P>
The lower interest rates--eventually as low as 3% on 30-year bonds and 4% on 30-year mortgages--also would foster a dramatic increase in private-sector capital formation.  Economists in both parties, supply-siders and demand-siders alike, agree that the living standards of wage earners can only rise with the kind of productivity increases that accompany rapid capital formation and lower long-term interest rates. 
<P>
<h4>Bipartisan Reorganization</h4> 
<P>
These two executive orders would create the kind of economic environment that would permit a genuine bipartisan reorganization of the responsibilities we entrust to the federal government.  Even the most liberal Democrats will acknowledge in private that many political tasks would be more efficiently handled at the state and local levels.  These Democrats strike a responsive chord with the electorate, though, when they argue against devolution of power in the current environment of economic anxiety and wage stagnation.  If Republicans continue to offer Democrats an inviting target, they will leap at the political advantage of resisting changes and derailing needed reforms in the name of protecting ordinary Americans against "extremist" Republicans. 
<P>
But if we consider the legitimate interests of all Americans, even those left behind, there is no reason why, with a suitable transition, we can't move steadily toward a low, single-rate, simplified tax system, as recommended by the Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which I was privileged to chair. 
<P>
The world "reform" is hardly sufficient to describe the work cut out for us.  In my 25 years in national politics, with rare exceptions, we have had one reform after another that has left us in worse shape than before.  We now have an opportunity for a one-in-a-lifetime reorganization of our federal government that is too obvious and important to be ignored.  History will not forgive us if we do.  As Ronald Reagan said, "If not us, who?  If not now, when?"

R.A.V., Petitioner, v.
<P>
CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.
<P>
No. 90-7675.
<P>
Argued Dec. 4, 1991.
<P>
Decided June 22, 1992.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2540
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner
R.A.V. was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota,
Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of
a symbol which one knows or has reason to know &quot;arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion or gender.&quot; The trial court dismissed this charge
on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and
impermissibly content-based, but the State Supreme Court reversed.
It rejected the overbreadth claim because the phrase &quot;arouses
anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot; had been construed
in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to &quot;fighting
words&quot; within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment.
The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated
threats to public safety and order.
<P>
Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment.
Pp.
<P>
2542-2550.
<P>
(a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting &quot;fighting
words.&quot; However, R.A.V.'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky
formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as
substantially overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance
unconstitutionally prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects
the speech addresses. P. 2542.
<P>
(b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation,
and fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally
proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely
invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate
them based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable
message they contain. Thus the regulation of &quot;fighting words&quot;
may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however,
be underinclusive, addressing some offensive instances and leaving
other, equally offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective
prescription is not based on content, or there is no realistic
possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 2542-2547.
<P>
(c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme
Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on the disfavored
subjects of &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
At the same time, it permits displays containing abusive invective
if they are not addressed to those topics. Moreover, in its practical
operation the ordinance goes beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint,
discrimination. Displays containing &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be
useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color,
etc. tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's
desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone
the &quot;group hatred&quot; of bias-motivated speech does not
justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content.
Pp. 2547-2549.
<P>
(d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance
does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of
speech at issue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the &quot;secondary
effects&quot; *2541 of speech within the meaning of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d
29, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not
threaten censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content
discrimination is not justified on the ground that the ordinance
is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in ensuring
the basic human rights of groups historically discriminated against,
since an ordinance not limited to the favored topics would have
precisely the same beneficial effect. Pp. 2549-2550.

<P>
Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several
other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely-made cross by taping
together broken chair legs. They then allegedly burned the cross
inside the fenced yard of a black family that lived across the
street from the house where petitioner was staying. Although this
conduct could have been punished under any of a number of laws,
(FN1) one of the two provisions under which respondent city of
St. Paul chose to charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the
St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn.Legis.Code
Sec. 292.02 (1990), which provides:
<P>
&quot;Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object,
appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not
limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows
or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender
commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot;
<P>
Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the
St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly
content-based and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment.
(FN2) The trial court granted this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme
Court reversed. That court rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim
because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases, see, e.g., In
re Welfare of S.L.J., 263 N.W.2d 412 (Minn.1978), the modifying
phrase &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot;
limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to
&quot;fighting words,&quot; i.e., &quot;conduct that itself inflicts
injury or tends to incite immediate violence ...,&quot; In re
Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn.1991) (citing Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 (1942)), and therefore the ordinance reached only expression
&quot;that the first amendment does not protect.&quot; 464 N.W.2d,
at 511. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because, in its view, &quot;the ordinance is a narrowly
tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental
interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated *2542
threats to public safety and order.&quot; Ibid. We granted certiorari,
501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2795, 115 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991).

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction
given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 339, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2975-2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.
747, 769, n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113
(1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895-896,
93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme
Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only
those expressions that constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; within
the meaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N.W.2d, at 510-511. Petitioner
and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation,
thereby invalidating the ordinance as &quot;substantially overbroad,&quot;
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-2915,
37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). We find it unnecessary to consider this
issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expression reached
by the ordinance is proscribable under the &quot;fighting words&quot;
doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech
solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses. (FN3)
<P>
The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
speech, see, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-311,
60 S.Ct. 900, 905-906, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), or even expressive
conduct, see, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), because of disapproval of
the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively
invalid. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, ---- -
----, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- - ---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Consolidated
Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 530,
536, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2332-2333, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289-2290,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). From 1791 to the present, however, our
society, like other free but civilized *2543 societies, has permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,
which are &quot;of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 762. We have recognized that
&quot;the freedom of speech&quot; referred to by the First Amendment
does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.
See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304,
1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343
U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952) (defamation); Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, supra, (&quot;fighting words&quot;); see generally
Simon &amp; Schuster, supra, 502 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Our decisions since
the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the traditional categorical
exceptions for defamation, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974);
see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 13-17,
110 S.Ct. 2695, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), and for obscenity,
see Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973), but a limited categorical approach has remained an
important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are
&quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308; Beauharnais,
supra, 343 U.S., at 266, 72 S.Ct., at 735; Chaplinsky, supra,
315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; or that the &quot;protection
of the First Amendment does not extend&quot; to them, Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 504,
104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); Sable Communications
of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835,
106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context,
however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally
repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity &quot;as not being
speech at all,&quot; Sunstein, Pornography and the First Amendment,
1986 Duke L.J. 589, 615, n. 146. What they mean is that these
areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be
regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content
(obscenity, defamation, etc.)--not that they are categories of
speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may
be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their
distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe
libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination
of proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently
acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U.S., at 763, 102
S.Ct., at 3357-3358, where, in upholding New York's child pornography
law, we expressly recognized that there was no &quot;question
here of censoring a particular literary theme....&quot; See also
id., at 775, 102 S.Ct., at 3364 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;As
drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication
of particular ideas&quot;).
<P>
Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First
Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regulation of particular
instances of such proscribable expression, so that the government
&quot;may regulate [them] freely,&quot; post, at 2552 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council
could enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene
works that contain criticism of the city government or, indeed,
that do not include endorsement of the city government. Such a
simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment
protection is at odds with common sense and with our jurisprudence
as well. (FN4) It is not true *2544 that &quot;fighting words&quot;
have at most a &quot;de minimis &quot; expressive content, ibid.,
or that their content is in all respects &quot;worthless and undeserving
of constitutional protection,&quot; post, at 2553; sometimes they
are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute
&quot;no part of the expression of ideas,&quot; but only that
they constitute &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas.&quot;
Chaplinsky, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769 (emphasis added).
<P>
The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable
on the basis of one feature (e.g., obscenity) but not on the basis
of another (e.g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace,
and has found application in many contexts. We have long held,
for example, that nonverbal expressive activity can be banned
because of the action it entails, but not because of the ideas
it expresses--so that burning a flag in violation of an ordinance
against outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag
in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.
See Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406-407, 109 S.Ct., at 2540-2541. See
also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct. 2456, 2460-2461, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (plurality);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.
367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
Similarly, we have upheld reasonable &quot;time, place, or manner&quot;
restrictions, but only if they are &quot;justified without reference
to the content of the regulated speech.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753-2754, 105 L.Ed.2d
661 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298, 104
S.Ct. 3065, 3071, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien
test differs little from the standard applied to time, place,
or manner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe particular
speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e.g., noise) does
not entail the power to proscribe the same speech on the basis
of a content element; so also, the power to proscribe it on the
basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity) does not entail
the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.
<P>
*2545 In other words, the exclusion of &quot;fighting words&quot;
from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for purposes
of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are,
despite their verbal character, essentially a &quot;nonspeech&quot;
element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to
a noisy sound truck: Each is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized,
a &quot;mode of speech,&quot; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268,
282, 71 S.Ct. 325, 333, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result); both can be used to convey an idea; but
neither has, in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment.
As with the sound truck, however, so also with fighting words:
The government may not regulate use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards
the underlying message expressed. Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (upholding, against

picketing) with Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286,

that exempted labor picketing). (FN5)
<P>
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new First Amendment
principle that prohibition of constitutionally proscribable speech
cannot be &quot;underinclusiv[e],&quot; post, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment &quot;absolutism&quot;
whereby &quot;within a particular 'proscribable' category of expression,
... a government must either proscribe all speech or no speech
at all,&quot; post, at 2562 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
That easy target is of the concurrences' own invention. In our
view, the First Amendment imposes not an &quot;underinclusiveness&quot;
limitation but a &quot;content discrimination&quot; limitation
upon a State's prohibition of proscribable speech. There is no
problem whatever, for example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity
(and other forms of proscribable expression) only in certain media
or markets, for although that prohibition would be &quot;underinclusive,&quot;
it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See, e.g.,
Sable Communications, 492 U.S., at 124-126, 109 S.Ct., at 2835-2836
(upholding 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(b)(1) (1988), which prohibits obscene
telephone communications).
<P>
Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert
the First Amendment requires is not absolute. It applies differently
in the context of proscribable speech than in the area of fully
protected speech. The rationale of the general prohibition, after
all, is that content discrimination &quot;rais[es] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints
from the marketplace,&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at
----, 112 S.Ct., at 508; Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. ----, ----,
111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991); FCC v. League of
Women Voters of California, 468 U.S. 364, 383-384, 104 S.Ct. 3106,
3119-3120, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co., 447
U.S., at 536, 100 S.Ct., at 2333; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,
408 U.S., at 95-98, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292. But content discrimination
among various instances of a class of proscribable speech often
does not pose this threat.
<P>
When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely
of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable,
no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.
Such a reason, having been adjudged neutral enough to support
exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection,
is also neutral enough to form the *2546 basis of distinction
within the class. To illustrate: A State might choose to prohibit
only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its
prurience--i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays
of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only
that obscenity which includes offensive political messages. See
Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F.2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert. denied,
498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991). And the
Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence
that are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707,
89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (upholding the facial
validity of Sec. 871 because of the &quot;overwhelmin[g] interest
in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing
him to perform his duties without interference from threats of
physical violence&quot;). But the Federal Government may not criminalize
only those threats against the President that mention his policy
on aid to inner cities. And to take a final example (one mentioned
by Justice STEVENS, post, at 2563-2564), a State may choose to
regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others,
because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of commercial
speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection,
see Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771-772, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830-1831, 48 L.Ed.2d
346 (1976)) is in its view greater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d
157 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising); Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d
444 (1978) (state regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State
may not prohibit only that commercial advertising that depicts
men in a demeaning fashion, see, e.g., L.A. Times, Aug. 8, 1989,
section 4, p. 6, col. 1.
<P>
Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even
a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the
subclass happens to be associated with particular &quot;secondary
effects&quot; of the speech, so that the regulation is &quot;justified
without reference to the content of the ... speech,&quot; Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 48, 106 S.Ct. 925, 929,
89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986) (quoting, with emphasis, Virginia Pharmacy
Bd., supra, 425 U.S., at 771, 96 S.Ct., at 1830); see also Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 71, n. 34, 96 S.Ct.
2440, 2453, n. 34, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); id., at
80-82, 96 S.Ct., at 2457-2458 (Powell, J., concurring);
<P>
Barnes, 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2469-2471 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit
all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover,
since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not
against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for
example, is violated by telling the enemy the nation's defense
secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable
class of speech can be swept up incidentally within the reach
of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech. See id.,
at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2460 (plurality); id., at ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER, J., concurring
in judgment); FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U.S.
411, 425-432, 110 S.Ct. 768, 776-780, 107 L.Ed.2d 851 (1990);
O'Brien, 391 U.S., at 376-377, 88 S.Ct., at 1678-1679. Thus, for
example, sexually derogatory &quot;fighting words,&quot; among
other words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition
against sexual discrimination in employment practices, 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2; 29 CFR Sec. 1604.11 (1991). See also 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242; 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1982. Where the government does not
target conduct on the *2547 basis of its expressive content, acts
are not shielded from regulation merely because they express a
discriminatory idea or philosophy.
<P>
These bases for distinction refute the proposition that the selectivity
of the restriction is &quot;even arguably 'conditioned upon the
sovereign's agreement with what a speaker may intend to say.'
&quot; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 555, 101 S.Ct.
2882, 2917, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
part) (citation omitted). There may be other such bases as well.
Indeed, to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribable
speech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identify any
particular &quot;neutral&quot; basis, so long as the nature of
the content discrimination is such that there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannot
think of any First Amendment interest that would stand in the
way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motion pictures
with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation, the regulation
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; like the regulation of noisy speech,
may address some offensive instances and leave other, equally
offensive, instances alone. See Posadas de Puerto Rico, 478 U.S.,
at 342-343, 106 S.Ct., at 2977-2978. (FN6)
<P>
II
<P>
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude
that, even as narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court,
the ordinance is facially unconstitutional. Although the phrase
in the ordinance, &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others,&quot; has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's
construction to reach only those symbols or displays that amount
to &quot;fighting words,&quot; the remaining, unmodified terms
make clear that the ordinance applies only to &quot;fighting words&quot;
that insult, or provoke violence, &quot;on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; Displays containing abusive
invective, no matter how vicious or severe, are permissible unless
they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics.
Those who wish to use &quot;fighting words&quot; in connection
with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis
of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality--are
not covered. The First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose
special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects. See Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at ---- - ----,
112 S.Ct., at ---- - ----; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 229-230, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
<P>
In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even
beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.
Displays containing some words--odious racial epithets, for example--would
be prohibited to proponents of all views. But &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or
*2548 gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--would
seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing
in favor of racial, color, etc. tolerance and equality, but could
not be used by that speaker's opponents. One could hold up a sign
saying, for example, that all &quot;anti-Catholic bigots&quot;
are misbegotten; but not that all &quot;papists&quot; are, for
that would insult and provoke violence &quot;on the basis of religion.&quot;
St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate
to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis
of Queensbury Rules.
<P>
What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
(which would be facially valid if it met the requirements of the
Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a prohibition of fighting
words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court repeatedly
emphasized) messages of &quot;bias-motivated&quot; hatred and
in particular, as applied to this case, messages &quot;based on
virulent notions of racial supremacy.&quot; 464 N.W.2d, at 508,
511. One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme
Court that &quot;[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation,
of diverse communities to confront such notions in whatever form
they appear,&quot; ibid., but the manner of that confrontation
cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech. St. Paul's
brief asserts that a general &quot;fighting words&quot; law would
not meet the city's needs because only a content-specific measure
can communicate to minority groups that the &quot;group hatred&quot;
aspect of such speech &quot;is not condoned by the majority.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that
majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its content.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul
acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group
hatred, Justice STEVENS suggests that this &quot;fundamentally
misreads&quot; the ordinance. Post, at 2570. It is directed, he
claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular
&quot;injur[ies]&quot; that are &quot;qualitatively different&quot;
from other injuries. Post, at 2565. This is word-play. What makes
the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc. produced by violation
of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor,
etc. produced by other fighting words is nothing other than the
fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive
message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It
is obvious that the symbols which will arouse &quot;anger, alarm
or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion
or gender&quot; are those symbols that communicate a message of
hostility based on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes
in its brief that the ordinance applies only to &quot;racial,
religious, or gender-specific symbols&quot; such as &quot;a burning
cross, Nazi swastika or other instrumentality of like import.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile
Court that &quot;[t]he burning of a cross does express a message
and it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.
Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate.&quot; Memorandum from the
Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A. Flinn, Jr.,
dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R.A.V., No. 89-D-1231
(Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted in App. to Brief for
Petitioner C-1.
<P>
The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paul ordinance
comes within neither any of the specific exceptions to the First
Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier, nor within a more
general exception for content discrimination that does not threaten
censorship of ideas. It assuredly does not fall within the exception
for content discrimination based on the very reasons why the particular
class of speech at issue (here, fighting words) is proscribable.
As explained earlier, see supra, at 2545, the reason why fighting
words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First
Amendment is not that their content communicates *2549 any particular
idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable
(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the
speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled out an especially
offensive mode of expression--it has not, for example, selected
for prohibition only those fighting words that communicate ideas
in a threatening (as opposed to a merely obnoxious) manner. Rather,
it has proscribed fighting words of whatever manner that communicate
messages of racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity
of this sort creates the possibility that the city is seeking
to handicap the expression of particular ideas. That possibility
would alone be enough to render the ordinance presumptively invalid,
but St. Paul's comments and concessions in this case elevate the
possibility to a certainty.
<P>
St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another of the
specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allows content
discrimination aimed only at the &quot;secondary effects&quot;
of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.
41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). According to St. Paul,
the ordinance is intended, &quot;not to impact on [sic ] the right
of free expression of the accused,&quot; but rather to &quot;protect
against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly
vulnerable because of their membership in a group that historically
has been discriminated against.&quot; Brief for Respondent 28.
Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes, rather
than merely regulates, a specified category of speech can ever
be considered to be directed only to the secondary effects of
such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinance is not directed
to secondary effects within the meaning of Renton. As we said
in Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
<P>
1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), &quot;[l]isteners' reactions to speech
are not the type of 'secondary effects' we referred to in Renton.&quot;
Id., at 321, 108 S.Ct., at 1163-1164. &quot;The emotive impact
of speech on its audience is not a 'secondary effect.' &quot;
Ibid. See also id., at 334, 108 S.Ct., at 1170-1171. (opinion
of Brennan, J.). (FN7)
<P>
It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fall within
some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for
any reason is beyond the suspicion of official suppression of
ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this very case afford ample
basis for, if not full confirmation of, that suspicion.
<P>
Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota
Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance regulates expression
based on hostility towards its protected ideological content,
this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests. Specifically, they
assert that the ordinance helps to ensure the basic human rights
of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live
in peace where they wish. We do not doubt that these interests
are compelling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote
them. But the &quot;danger of censorship&quot; presented by a
facially content-based statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S.
----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991), requires
that that weapon be employed only where it is &quot;necessary
to serve the asserted [compelling] interest,&quot; Burson v. Freeman,
504 *2550 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5
(1992) (plurality) (emphasis added); Perry Education Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948,
954-955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral
alternatives thus &quot;undercut[s] significantly&quot; any defense
of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, 485 U.S., at 329, 108
S.Ct., at 1168, casting considerable doubt on the government's
protestations that &quot;the asserted justification is in fact
an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law,&quot;
Burson, supra, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1859 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring). See Boos, supra, 485 U.S., at 324-329, 108 S.Ct.,
at 1165-1168; cf. Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota
Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 586-587, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1372-1373,
75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983). The dispositive question in this case,
therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary
to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not.
An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for example, would
have precisely the same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest
distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displaying
the city council's special hostility towards the particular biases
thus singled out. (FN8) That is precisely what the First Amendment
forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled to express that
hostility--but not through the means of imposing unique limitations
upon speakers who (however benightedly) disagree.
<P>
* * *
<P>
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross
in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient
means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding
the First Amendment to the fire.
<P>
The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice O'CONNOR
join, and with whom Justice STEVENS joins except as to Part I(A),
concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme
Court should be reversed. However, our agreement ends there.
<P>
This case could easily be decided within the contours of established
First Amendment law by holding, as petitioner argues, that the
St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes
not only unprotected expression but expression protected by the
First Amendment. See Part II, infra. Instead, &quot;find[ing]
it unnecessary&quot; to consider the questions upon which we granted
review, (FN1) ante, at 2542, the *2551 Court holds the ordinance
facially unconstitutional on a ground that was never presented
to the Minnesota Supreme Court, a ground that has not been briefed
by the parties before this Court, a ground that requires serious
departures from the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent
with the plurality opinion in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992), which was joined by two
of the five Justices in the majority in the present case.
<P>
This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its precedents.
Twice within the past month, the Court has declined to overturn
longstanding but controversial decisions on questions of constitutional
law. See Allied Signal, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation,
504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2251, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992); Quill
Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d
91 (1992). In each case, we had the benefit of full briefing on
the critical issue, so that the parties and amici had the opportunity
to apprise us of the impact of a change in the law. And in each
case, the Court declined to abandon its precedents, invoking the
principle of stare decisis. Allied Signal, Inc., supra, --- U.S.,
at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261;
<P>
Quill Corp., supra, --- U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1915-1916.
<P>
But in the present case, the majority casts aside long-established
First Amendment doctrine without the benefit of briefing and adopts
an untried theory. This is hardly a judicious way of proceeding,
and the Court's reasoning in reaching its result is transparently
wrong.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression falling
within certain limited categories so lacks the values the First
Amendment was designed to protect that the Constitution affords
no protection to that expression. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), made the point
in the clearest possible terms:
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise
<P>
any Constitutional problem.... It has been well observed that
such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be *2552 derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Id., at 571-572,
62 S.Ct., at 769.
<P>
See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
466 U.S. 485, 504, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984)
(citing Chaplinsky ).
<P>
Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 2543, this Court
has long held certain discrete categories of expression to be
proscribable on the basis of their content. For instance, the
Court has held that the individual who falsely shouts &quot;fire&quot;
in a crowded theatre may not claim the protection of the First
Amendment. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct.
247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919). The Court has concluded that neither
child pornography, nor obscenity, is protected by the First Amendment.
New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73
L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 20, 93
S.Ct. 2607, 2612, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Roth v. United States,
354 U.S. 476, 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308-1309, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957). And the Court has observed that, &quot;[l]eaving aside
the special considerations when public officials [and public figures]
are the target, a libelous publication is not protected by the
Constitution.&quot; Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763, 102 S.Ct.,
at 3358 (citations omitted).
<P>
All of these categories are content based. But the Court has held
that First mendment does not apply to them because their expressive
content is worthless or of de minimis value to society. Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769. We have not
departed from this principle, emphasizing repeatedly that, &quot;within
the confines of [these] given classification[s], the evil to be
restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,
if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication
is required.&quot;
<P>
Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2231, 44
L.Ed.2d 600 (1975). This categorical approach has provided a principled
and narrowly focused means for distinguishing between expression
that the government may regulate freely and that which it may
regulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of compelling
need. (FN2)
<P>
Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courts did not
mean their repeated statements that certain categories of expression
are &quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308. See ante, at
2543, citing Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct.
725, 735, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952); Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S., at
571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; Bose Corp., supra, 466 U.S., at

FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989).
The present Court submits that such clear statements &quot;must
be taken in context&quot; and are not &quot;literally true.&quot;
Ante, at 2543.
<P>
To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what they said:
The categorical approach is a firmly entrenched part of our First
Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Court in Roth reviewed the
guarantees of freedom of expression in effect at the time of the
ratification of the Constitution and concluded, &quot;[i]n light
of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing
of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.&quot;
354 U.S., at 482-483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308.
<P>
In its decision today, the Court points to &quot;[n]othing ...
in this Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this longstanding
tradition.&quot; Burson, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1860
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Allied Signal, Inc., supra,
*2553 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261. Nevertheless, the majority
holds that the First Amendment protects those narrow categories
of expression long held to be undeserving of First Amendment protection--at
least to the extent that lawmakers may not regulate some fighting
words more strictly than others because of their content. The
Court announces that such content-based distinctions violate the
First Amendment because &quot;the government may not regulate
use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying
message expressed.&quot; Ante, at 2545. Should the government
want to criminalize certain fighting words, the Court now requires
it to criminalize all fighting words.
<P>
To borrow a phrase, &quot;Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all
approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with common
sense and with our jurisprudence as well.&quot; Ante, at 2543.
It is inconsistent to hold that the government may proscribe an
entire category of speech because the content of that speech is
evil, Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
but that the government may not treat a subset of that category
differently without violating the First Amendment; the content
of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of constitutional
protection.
<P>
The majority's observation that fighting words are &quot;quite
expressive indeed,&quot; ante, at 2544, is no answer. Fighting
words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying supporters,
or registering a protest; they are directed against individuals
to provoke violence or to inflict injury. Chaplinsky, 315 U.S.,
at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Therefore, a ban on all fighting words
or on a subset of the fighting words category would restrict only
the social evil of hate speech, without creating the danger of
driving viewpoints from the marketplace. See ante, at 2545.
<P>
Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand of First
Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me. (FN3) The overbreadth
doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chilling
of protected expression, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,
612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); Osborne v. Ohio,
495 U.S. 103, 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, n. 8, 109 L.Ed.2d
98 (1990); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503,
105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985); Ferber, supra, 458
U.S., at 772, 102 S.Ct., at 3362, but the Court's new &quot;underbreadth&quot;
creation serves no desirable function. Instead, it permits, indeed
invites, the continuation of expressive conduct that in this case
is evil and worthless in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra,
at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359; Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S.,
at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769, until the city of St. Paul cures
the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catch-all phrase
such as &quot;and all other fighting words that may constitutionally
be subject to this ordinance.&quot;
<P>
Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence
is surely a negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions
of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred
conveyed by burning a cross on someone's lawn, are of sufficient
value to outweigh the social interest in order and morality that
has traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First
Amendment. (FN4) Indeed, by characterizing fighting words as a
form of &quot;debate,&quot; ante, at 2548, the majority *2554
legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion.
<P>
Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speech that could
be regulated freely on the basis of content (i.e., the narrow
categories of expression falling outside the First Amendment)
and that which could be regulated on the basis of content only
upon a showing of a compelling state interest (i.e., all remaining
expression). By placing fighting words, which the Court has long
held to be valueless, on at least equal constitutional footing
with political discourse and other forms of speech that we have
deemed to have the greatest social value, the majority devalues
the latter category. See Burson v. Freeman, supra, --- at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1849-1850; Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 222-223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019-1020,
103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).
<P>
B
<P>
In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses to sustain
the ordinance even though it would survive under the strict scrutiny
applicable to other protected expression. Assuming, arguendo,
that the St. Paul ordinance is a content-based regulation of protected
expression, it nevertheless would pass First Amendment review
under settled law upon a showing that the regulation &quot; 'is
necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly
drawn to achieve that end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.
v. New York Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct.
501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project,
Inc., v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). St. Paul has urged that its ordinance, in
the words of the majority, &quot;helps to ensure the basic human
rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination....&quot; Ante, at ----. The Court expressly
concedes that this interest is compelling and is promoted by the
ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strict scrutiny
analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality of the legislation:
<P>
&quot;The dispositive question ... is whether content discrimination
is reasonably necessary in order to achieve St. Paul's compelling
interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the
favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.&quot;
Ibid.
<P>
Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-based ordinance
could never pass constitutional muster if the object of that legislation
could be accomplished by banning a wider category of speech. This
appears to be a general renunciation of strict scrutiny review,
a fundamental tool of First Amendment analysis. (FN5)
<P>
This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in light of our
decision in Burson v. Freeman, supra, which was handed down just
a month ago. (FN6) In Burson, seven *2555 of the eight participating
members of the Court agreed that the strict scrutiny standard
applied in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a content-based
statute. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1851; id., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 1848 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). (FN7) The statute at
issue prohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or
distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance
to a polling place. The plurality concluded that the legislation
survived strict scrutiny because the State had asserted a compelling
interest in regulating electioneering near polling places and
because the statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish
that goal. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856-1857.
<P>
Significantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all speech
near polling places; it restricted only political speech. Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1850. The Burson plurality, which included
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the distinction
between types of speech required application of strict scrutiny,
but it squarely rejected the proposition that the legislation
failed First Amendment review because it could have been drafted
in broader, content-neutral terms:
<P>
&quot;States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them.
<P>
The First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems
that do not exist.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856 (emphasis
added).
<P>
This reasoning is in direct conflict with the majority's analysis
in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmakers attempting
to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enact a sweeping prohibition
on an entire class of speech (thereby requiring &quot;regulat[ion]
for problems that do not exist); or (2) not legislate at all.
<P>
Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the present case been
applied in Burson, the challenged election law would have failed
constitutional review, for its content-based distinction between
political and nonpolitical speech could not have been characterized
as &quot;reasonably necessary,&quot; ante, at 2550, to achieve
the State's interest in regulating polling place premises. (FN8)
<P>
As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the
majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our firmly established
strict scrutiny analysis at this time. The majority appears to
believe that its doctrinal revisionism is necessary to prevent
our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against members of
one political party but not another and from enacting similarly
preposterous laws. Ante, at 2543. The majority is misguided.
<P>
Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected
speech, such as fighting words, the Equal Protection Clause requires
that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related
to a legitimate government interest. A defamation statute that
drew distinctions on the basis of political affiliation or &quot;an
ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain
criticism of the *2556 city government,&quot; ante, at 2543, would
unquestionably fail rational basis review. (FN9)
<P>
Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming arguendo, as the
majority does, that the ordinance is not constitutionally overbroad
(but see Part II, infra ), there is no question that it would
pass equal protection review. The ordinance proscribes a subset
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; those that injure &quot;on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; This selective
regulation reflects the City's judgment that harms based on race,
color, creed, religion, or gender are more pressing public concerns
than the harms caused by other fighting words. In light of our
Nation's long and painful experience with discrimination, this
determination is plainly reasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes,
the interest is compelling. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
C
<P>
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive
list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be viewed either as an
attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of
this case, see post, at 2560-2561 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in
judgment), or as an effort to anticipate some of the questions
that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law.
<P>
For instance, if the majority were to give general application
to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decision would
call into question the
<P>
constitutionality of the statute making it illegal to threaten
the life of the President. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871. See Watts v. United
States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per
curiam ). Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats,
incorporates a content-based distinction; it indicates that the
Government especially disfavors threats against the President
as opposed to threats against all others. (FN10) See ante, at
2547. But because the Government could prohibit all threats and
not just those directed against the President, under the Court's
theory, the compelling reasons justifying the enactment of special
legislation to safeguard the President would be irrelevant, and
the statute would fail First Amendment review.
<P>
To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the following
exception onto its newly announced First Amendment rule: Content-based
distinctions may be drawn within an unprotected category of speech
if the basis for the distinctions is &quot;the very reason the
entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot; Ante, at
2545. Thus, the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to
threaten the life of the President is constitutional, &quot;since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President.&quot; Ante, at 2546.
<P>
The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should
apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since &quot;the reasons why [fighting
words] are outside the First Amendment ... have special force
when applied to [groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination].&quot;
<P>
To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that
fighting words are *2557 simply a mode of communication, rather
than a content-based category, and that the St. Paul ordinance
has not singled out a particularly objectionable mode of communication.
Ante, at 2545, 2548. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A
prohibition on fighting words is not a time, place, or manner
restriction; it is a ban on a class of speech that conveys an
overriding message of personal injury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769, a message that is at
its ugliest when directed against groups that have long been the
targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance falls within
the first exception to the majority's theory.
<P>
As its second exception, the Court posits that certain content-based
regulations will survive under the new regime if the regulated
subclass &quot;happens to be associated with particular 'secondary
effects' of the speech ...,&quot; ante, at 2546, which the majority
treats as encompassing instances in which &quot;words can ...
violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct ...&quot;
Ante, at 2546. (FN11) Again, there is a simple explanation for
the Court's eagerness to craft an exception to its new First Amendment
rule:
<P>
Under the general rule the Court applies in this case, Title VII
hostile work environment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional.
<P>
Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate &quot;because of [an]
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&quot;
42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1), and the regulations covering hostile
workplace claims forbid &quot;sexual harassment,&quot; which includes
&quot;[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature&quot;
which creates &quot;an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.&quot; 29 CFR Sec.
<P>
1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit workplace
harassment generally; it focuses on what the majority would characterize
as the &quot;disfavored topi[c]&quot; of sexual harassment. Ante,
at 2547. In this way, Title VII is similar to the St. Paul ordinance
that the majority condemns because it &quot;impose[s] special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects.&quot; Ibid. Under the broad principle the Court uses
to decide the present case, hostile work environment claims based
on sexual harassment should fail First Amendment review; because
a general ban on harassment in the workplace would cover the problem
of sexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategory
of sexually harassing expression would violate the First Amendment.
<P>
Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court indicates
would insulate a Title VII hostile work environment claim from
an underinclusiveness challenge because &quot;sexually derogatory
'fighting words' ... may produce a violation of Title VII's general
prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices.&quot;
Ante, at 2546. But application of this exception to a hostile
work environment claim does not hold up under close examination.
<P>
First, the hostile work environment regulation is not keyed to
the presence or absence of an economic quid pro quo, Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d
49 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimized worker.
Consequently, the regulation would no more fall within a secondary
effects exception than does the St. Paul ordinance. Ante, at 2549.
Second, the majority's focus on the statute's general prohibition
on discrimination glosses over the language of the specific regulation
governing hostile working environment, which reaches beyond any
&quot;incidental&quot; effect on speech. United States v. O'Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
If the relationship between *2558 the broader statute and specific
regulation is sufficient to bring the Title VII regulation within
O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to bring its ordinance within
this exception is to add some prefatory language concerning discrimination
generally.
<P>
As the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding this
case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to protect against
unforeseen problems, a concern that is heightened here given the
lack of briefing on the majority's decisional theory. This final
exception would apply in cases in which &quot;there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&quot;
Ante, at 2547. As I have demonstrated, this case does not concern
the official suppression of ideas. See supra, at 2553. The majority
discards this notion out-of-hand. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do nothing
more than confuse the law. Its selection of this case to rewrite
First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable, because the
whole problem could have been avoided by deciding this case under
settled First Amendment principles.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with
its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However,
I would decide the case on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doctrine is
an exception to the established principle that &quot;a person
to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be
heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably
be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not
before the Court.&quot; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S., at 610,
93 S.Ct., at 2915; Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S.,
at 503-504, 105 S.Ct., at 2801-2802. A defendant being prosecuted
for speech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on its
face if it reaches protected expression, even when that person's
activities are not protected by the First Amendment. This is because
&quot;the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected
speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that
protected speech of others may be muted.&quot; Broadrick, supra,
413 U.S., at 612, 93 S.Ct., at 2916; Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.,
at 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct., at 169, n. 8; New York v. Ferber, supra,
458 U.S., at 768-769, 102 S.Ct. at 3360-3361;
<P>
Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,
634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 834, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980); Gooding v. Wilson,
405 U.S. 518, 521, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972).
<P>
However, we have consistently held that, because overbreadth analysis
is &quot;strong medicine,&quot; it may be invoked to strike an
entire statute only when the overbreadth of the statute is not
only &quot;real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,&quot; Broadrick, 413 U.S.,
at 615, 93 S.Ct., at 2917, and when the statute is not susceptible
to limitation or partial invalidation. Id., at 613, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2916; Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 574, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 2571, 96 L.Ed.2d 500
(1987). &quot;When a federal court is dealing with a federal statute
challenged as overbroad, it should ... construe the statute to
avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to a
limiting construction.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S., at 769, n. 24,
102 S.Ct., at 3361, n. 24. Of course, &quot;[a] state court is
also free to deal with a state statute in the same way.&quot;
Ibid. See, e.g., Osborne, 495 U.S. at 113-114, 110 S.Ct., at 1698-1699.
<P>
Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not susceptible
to a narrowing construction and that the ordinance therefore should
be considered as written, and not as construed by the Minnesota
Supreme Court. Petitioner is wrong. Where a state court has interpreted
a provision of state law, we cannot ignore that interpretation,
*2559 even if it is not one that we would have reached if we were
construing the statute in the first instance. Ibid.;
<P>
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1856, 75
L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,
Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, n. 5, 71
L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). (FN12)
<P>
Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpretation does
not insulate a statute from overbreadth review. We have stricken
legislation when the construction supplied by the state court
failed to cure the overbreadth problem. See, e.g., Lewis v. City
of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 132-133, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972, 39 L.Ed.2d
214 (1974); Gooding, supra, 405 U.S., at 524-525, 92 S.Ct., at
1107-1108. But in such cases, we have looked to the statute as
construed in determining whether it contravened the First Amendment.
Here, the Minnesota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative
construction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Consideration
of petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on that interpretation.
<P>
I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face.
Although the ordinance as construed reaches categories of speech
that are constitutionally unprotected, it also criminalizes a
substantial amount of expression that--however repugnant--is shielded
by the First Amendment.
<P>
In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias ordinance,
the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two of the categories
of speech and expressive conduct that fall outside the First Amendment's
protective sphere: words that incite &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot;
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1830, 23
L.Ed.2d 430 (1969), and &quot;fighting&quot; words, Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769.
The Minnesota Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky
fighting words test and consequently interpreted the St. Paul
ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinance facially overbroad.
<P>
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court
drew upon the definition of fighting words that appears in Chaplinsky--words
&quot;which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Id., at 572, 62
S.Ct., at 769. However, the Minnesota court was far from clear
in identifying the &quot;injur[ies]&quot; inflicted by the expression
that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, the Minnesota court
emphasized (tracking the language of the ordinance) that &quot;the
ordinance censors only those displays that one knows or should
know will create anger, alarm or resentment based on racial, ethnic,
gender or religious bias.&quot; In re Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d
507, 510 (1991). I therefore understand the court to have ruled
that St. Paul may constitutionally prohibit expression that &quot;by
its very utterance&quot; causes &quot;anger, alarm or resentment.&quot;
<P>
Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that such generalized
reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional
protection. The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt
feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression
unprotected. See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 319,
110 S.Ct. 2404, 2410, 110 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990); Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, *2560 409, 414, 109 S.Ct. 2533,

Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 55-56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 881-882, 99 L.Ed.2d
41 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 745, 98 S.Ct.

(1949).
<P>
In the First Amendment context, &quot;[c]riminal statutes must
be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawful
a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may
be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.&quot;
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d
398 (1987) (citation omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance
is such a law. Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is
unprotected, it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes
only hurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by
the First Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, 415 U.S., at 132, 94 S.Ct.,
at 972. (FN13) The ordinance is therefore fatally overbroad and
invalid on its face.

<P>
Today, the Court has disregarded two established principles of
First Amendment law without providing a coherent replacement theory.
Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire interpretation, driven by
the frequently irresistible impulse of judges to tinker with the
First Amendment. The decision is mischievous at best and will
surely confuse the lower courts. I join the judgment, but not
the folly of the opinion.
<P>
Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The majority opinion
signals one of two possibilities: it will serve as precedent for
future cases, or it will not. Either result is disheartening.
<P>
In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regulate
speech that causes great harm unless it also regulates speech
that does not (setting law and logic on their heads), the Court
seems to abandon the categorical approach, and inevitably to relax
the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As Justice
WHITE points out, this weakens the traditional protections of
speech. If all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection,
that protection will be scant. The simple reality is that the
Court will never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising
the level of protection customarily granted political speech.
If we are forbidden from categorizing, as the Court has done here,
we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that in
its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Court
is willing to weaken First Amendment protections.
<P>
In the second instance is the possibility that this case will
not significantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence, but, instead,
will be regarded as an aberration--a case where the Court manipulated
doctrine to strike down an ordinance whose premise it opposed,
namely, that racial threats and *2561 verbal assaults are of greater
harm than other fighting words. I fear that the Court has been
distracted from its proper mission by the temptation to decide
the issue over &quot;politically correct speech&quot; and &quot;cultural
diversity,&quot; neither of which is presented here. If this is
the meaning of today's opinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable.
<P>
I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law
that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities out of their homes
by burning crosses on their lawns, but I see great harm in preventing
the people of Saint Paul from specifically punishing the race-based
fighting words that so prejudice their community.
<P>
I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice
WHITE that this particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words
to speech protected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice BLACKMUN
join as to Part I, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms may
be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a fire near an ammunition
dump or a gasoline storage tank is especially dangerous; such
behavior may be punished more severely than burning trash in a
vacant lot. Threatening someone because of her race or religious
beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot,
and threatening a high public official may cause substantial social
disruption; such threats may be punished more severely than threats
against someone based on, say, his support of a particular athletic
team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutral justifications
for such special rules.
<P>
This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordinance.
Because the regulated conduct has some communicative content--a
message of racial, religious or gender hostility--the ordinance
raises two quite different First Amendment questions. Is the ordinance
&quot;overbroad&quot; because it prohibits too much speech? If
not, is it &quot;underbroad&quot; because it does not prohibit
enough speech?
<P>
In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle with
two broad principles: first, that certain &quot;categories of
expression [including 'fighting words'] are 'not within the area
of constitutionally protected speech,' &quot; ante, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment); and second, that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations [of expression] are presumptively invalid.&quot; Ante,
at 2542 (Opinion of the Court). Although in past opinions the
Court has repeated both of these maxims, it has--quite rightly--adhered
to neither with the absolutism suggested by my colleagues. Thus,
while I agree that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally
overbroad for the reasons stated in Part II of Justice WHITE's
opinion, I write separately to suggest how the allure of absolute
principles has skewed the analysis of both the majority and concurring
opinions.
<P>
I
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical approach
to First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem.... It has been well
observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition
of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86
L.Ed. 1031 (1942).
<P>
We have, as Justice WHITE observes, often described such categories
of expression as &quot;not within the area of constitutionally
protected speech.&quot; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483,
77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957).
<P>
*2562 The Court today revises this categorical approach. It is
not, the Court rules, that certain &quot;categories&quot; of expression
are &quot;unprotected,&quot; but rather that certain &quot;elements&quot;
of expression are wholly &quot;proscribable.&quot; To the Court,
an expressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more
than one element. Although the act may be regulated because it
contains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated on the
basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also contains. Thus,
obscene antigovernment speech may be regulated because it is obscene,
but not because it is antigovernment. Ante, at 2543. It is this
revision of the categorical approach that allows the Court to
assume that the St. Paul ordinance proscribes only fighting words,
while at the same time concluding that the ordinance is invalid
because it imposes a content-based regulation on expressive activity.
<P>
As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical
approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doctrinal
wonderland, for the concept of &quot;obscene anti-government&quot;
speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene is very narrow;
to be obscene, expression must be found by the trier of fact to
&quot;appea[l] to the prurient interest, ... depic[t] or describ[e],
in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct, [and] taken as a
whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.&quot; Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607,
2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (emphasis added). &quot;Obscene
antigovernment&quot; speech, then, is a contradiction in terms:
If expression is antigovernment, it does not &quot;lac[k] serious
... political ... value&quot; and cannot be obscene.
<P>
The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its novel
analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time, place, or
manner of expression or on expressive conduct. It is true that
loud speech in favor of the Republican Party can be regulated
because it is loud, but not because it is pro-Republican; and
it is true that the public burning of the American flag can be
regulated because it involves public burning and not because it
involves the flag. But these analogies are inapposite. In each
of these examples, the two elements (e.g., loudness and pro-Republican
orientation) can coexist; in the case of &quot;obscene antigovernment&quot;
speech, however, the presence of one element (&quot;obscenity&quot;)
by definition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it is
unwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on such highly
speculative hypotheticals.
<P>
I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's
analysis--namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is
an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Drawing
on broadly worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute
ban on content-based regulations of expression and holds that
the First Amendment prohibits the regulation of fighting words
by subject matter. Thus, while the Court rejects the &quot;all-or-nothing-at-all&quot;
nature of the categorical approach, ante, at 2543, it promptly
embraces an absolutism of its own: within a particular &quot;proscribable&quot;
category of expression, the Court holds, a government must either
proscribe all speech or no speech at all. (FN1) This aspect of
the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the role and constitutional
status of content-based regulations *2563 on speech, conflicts
with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence, and disrupts
well-settled principles of First Amendment law.
<P>
Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that content-based
regulations of speech are &quot;never permitted,&quot; Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2292,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), such claims are overstated. Indeed, in
Mosley itself, the Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription
of nonlabor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather
could be upheld if the City demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
Id., at 100, 92 S.Ct., at 2292. Contrary to the broad dicta in
Mosley and elsewhere, our decisions demonstrate that content-based
distinctions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable
and indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of the First
Amendment.
<P>
This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In broadest
terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudence creates a regime
based on the content of speech. The scope of the First Amendment
is determined by the content of expressive activity: Although
the First Amendment broadly protects &quot;speech,&quot; it does
not protect the right to &quot;fix prices, breach contracts, make
false warranties, place bets with bookies, threaten, [or] extort.&quot;
Schauer, Categories and the First Amendment: A Play in Three Acts,
34 Vand.L.Rev. 265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitors
is a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine (FN2) hinges upon the content of
the agreement. Similarly, &quot;the line between permissible advocacy
and impermissible incitation to crime or violence depends, not
merely on the setting in which the speech occurs, but also on
exactly what the speaker had to say.&quot; Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 66, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2450, 49 L.Ed.2d
310 (1976) (plurality opinion); see also Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S.
95, 100-103, 68 S.Ct. 397, 399-401, 92 L.Ed. 562 (1948) (Rutledge,
J., dissenting).
<P>
Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the categories of
&quot;unprotected&quot; or &quot;proscribable&quot; expression
is determined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine is
obscene, a gesture a fighting word, or a photograph child pornography
is determined, in part, by its content. Even within categories
of protected expression, the First Amendment status of speech
is fixed by its content. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.
254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939,
86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), establish that the level of protection
given to speech depends upon its subject matter: speech about
public officials or matters of public concern receives greater
protection than speech about other topics. It can, therefore,
scarcely be said that the regulation of expressive activity cannot
be predicated on its content: much of our First Amendment jurisprudence
is premised on the assumption that content makes a difference.
<P>
Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently upheld
content-based regulations of speech. For example, in Young v.
American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zoning ordinances that
regulated movie theaters based on the content of the films shown.
In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57
L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restriction
on the broadcast of specific indecent words. In Lehman v. City
of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770
(1974) (plurality opinion), we upheld a city law that permitted
commercial advertising, but prohibited political advertising,
on city buses. In Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 *2564
S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), we upheld a state law that
restricted the speech of state employees, but only as concerned
partisan political matters. We have long recognized the power
of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate misleading advertising
and labeling, see, e.g., Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608,
66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946), and the National Labor Relations
Board's power to regulate an employer's election-related speech
on the basis of its content. See, e.g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing
Co., 395 U.S. 575, 616-618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942-1943, 23 L.Ed.2d
547 (1969). It is also beyond question that the Government may
choose to limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U.S.C. Secs.
1331-1340, (FN3) but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline
advertising, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), but not bus advertising;
or choose to monitor solicitation by lawyers, see Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978),
but not by doctors.
<P>
All of these cases involved the selective regulation of speech
based on content--precisely the sort of regulation the Court invalidates
today. Such selective regulations are unavoidably content based,
but they are not, in my opinion, &quot;presumptively invalid.&quot;
As these many decisions and examples demonstrate, the prohibition
on content-based regulations is not nearly as total as the Mosley
dictum suggests.
<P>
Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today goes
beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and applies the prohibition
on content-based regulation to speech that the Court had until
today considered wholly &quot;unprotected&quot; by the First Amendment--namely,
fighting words. This new absolutism in the prohibition of content-based
regulations severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amendment
law.
<P>
Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in
the constitutional protection of speech. Core political speech
occupies the highest, most protected position; commercial speech
and nonobscene, sexually explicit speech are regarded as a sort
of second-class expression; obscenity and fighting words receive
the least protection of all. Assuming that the Court is correct
that this last class of speech is not wholly &quot;unprotected,&quot;
it certainly does not follow that fighting words and obscenity
receive the same sort of protection afforded core political speech.
Yet in ruling that proscribable speech cannot be regulated based
on subject matter, the Court does just that. (FN4) Perversely,
this gives fighting words greater protection than is afforded
commercial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising
directed at airline passengers without also prohibiting false
advertising directed at bus passengers and if a city can prohibit
political advertisements in its buses while allowing other advertisements,
it is ironic to hold that a city cannot regulate fighting words
based on &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; while
leaving unregulated fighting words based on &quot;union membership
or homosexuality.&quot; Ante, at 2547. The Court today turns First
Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once entirely
unprotected (and that still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled
to greater protection than commercial speech--and possibly greater
protection than core political *2565 speech. See Burson v. Freeman,
504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, ----, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities, it quickly
offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly extended prohibition
on content-based regulations. First, the Court states that a content-based
regulation is valid &quot;[w]hen the content discrimination is
based upon the very reason the entire class of speech ... is proscribable.&quot;
In a pivotal passage, the Court writes &quot;the Federal Government
can criminalize only those physical threats that are directed
against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since the reasons
why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting
individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that
fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence
will occur) have special force when applied to the ... President.&quot;
Ante, at 2546.
<P>
As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose from
the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribe only
a subset (threats against the President) because those threats
are particularly likely to cause &quot;fear of violence,&quot;
&quot;disruption,&quot; and actual &quot;violence.&quot;
<P>
Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the conclusion
that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just as Congress
may determine that threats against the President entail more severe
consequences than other threats, so St. Paul's City Council may
determine that threats based on the target's race, religion, or
gender cause more severe harm to both the target and to society
than other threats. This latter judgment--that harms caused by
racial, religious, and gender-based invective are qualitatively
different from that caused by other fighting words--seems to me
eminently reasonable and realistic.
<P>
Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate advertising
in one industry but not another because &quot;the risk of fraud
(one of the characteristics that justifies depriving [commercial
speech] of full First Amendment protection ...)&quot; in the regulated
industry is &quot;greater&quot; than in other industries. Ante,
at 2546. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the constitutionality
of St. Paul's ordinance. &quot;[O]ne of the characteristics that
justifies&quot; the constitutional status of fighting words is
that such words &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury or
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Chaplinsky,
315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 762. Certainly a legislature that
may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal trade
than in the medical trade may determine that the risk of injury
or breach of peace created by race-based threats is greater than
that created by other threats.
<P>
Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis
of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that &quot;a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
... would be facially valid.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis deleted).
A selective proscription of unprotected expression designed to
protect &quot;certain persons or groups&quot; (for example, a
law proscribing threats directed at the elderly) would be constitutional
if it were based on a legitimate determination that the harm created
by the regulated expression differs from that created by the unregulated
expression (that is, if the elderly are more severely injured
by threats than are the nonelderly). Such selective protection
is no different from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors)
from obtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968). St. Paul has
determined--reasonably in my judgment--that fighting-word injuries
&quot;based on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; are
qualitatively different and more severe than fighting-word injuries
based on other characteristics. Whether the selective proscription
of proscribable speech is defined by the protected target (&quot;certain
persons or groups&quot;) or the basis of the harm (injuries &quot;based
on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot;) makes no constitutional
difference: what matters is whether *2566 the legislature's selection
is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonable distinction.
<P>
In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling--that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations are presumptively invalid&quot;--has simplistic appeal,
but lacks support in our First Amendment jurisprudence. To make
matters worse, the Court today extends this overstated claim to
reach categories of hitherto unprotected speech and, in doing
so, wreaks havoc in an area of settled law. Finally, although
the Court recognizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions
undermine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional.
Stated directly, the majority's position cannot withstand scrutiny.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I agree with much of Justice WHITE's analysis, I do not
join Part I-A of his opinion because I have reservations about
the &quot;categorical approach&quot; to the First Amendment. These
concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, see, e.g., New
York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 778, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3365-3366,
73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment),
lead me to find Justice WHITE's response to the Court's analysis
unsatisfying.
<P>
Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has
some appeal:
<P>
either expression is protected or it is not--the categories create
safe harbors for governments and speakers alike. But this approach
sacrifices subtlety for clarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately
unsound. As an initial matter, the concept of &quot;categories&quot;
fits poorly with the complex reality of expression. Few dividing
lines in First Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and
efforts at categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.
Our definitions of &quot;obscenity,&quot; see, e.g., Marks v.
United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198, 97 S.Ct. 990, 996, 51 L.Ed.2d
260 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part), and &quot;public forum,&quot; see, e.g., United States
Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S.
114, 126-131, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2683-2686, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981);
id., at 136-140, 101 S.Ct., at 2688-2691 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 147-151, 101 S.Ct., at 2694-2696 (Marshall,
J., dissenting); 152-154, 101 S.Ct. at 2696-2698 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (all debating the definition of &quot;public forum&quot;),
illustrate this all too well. The quest for doctrinal certainty
through the definition of categories and subcategories is, in
my opinion, destined to fail.
<P>
Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the
importance of context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy
of its regulation can only be determined in context. (FN5) Whether,
for example, a picture or a sentence is obscene cannot be judged
in the abstract, but rather only in the context of its setting,
its use, and its audience. Similarly, although legislatures may
freely regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography
that is part of &quot;a serious work of art, a documentary on
behavioral problems, or a medical or psychiatric teaching device,&quot;
may be entitled to constitutional protection; the &quot;question
whether a specific act of communication is protected by the First
Amendment always requires some consideration of both its content
and its context.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S. at 778, 102 S.Ct., at
3366 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); see also Smith v.
<P>
United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311-321, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1769-1774,
52 L.Ed.2d 324
<P>
(1977) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The categorical approach sweeps
too broadly when it declares that all such expression *2567 is
beyond the protection of the First Amendment.
<P>
Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing approach,
the Court has applied its analysis less categorically than its
doctrinal statements suggest.
<P>
The Court has recognized intermediate categories of speech (for
example, for indecent nonobscene speech and commercial speech)
and geographic categories of speech (public fora, limited public
fora, nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection.
The Court has also stringently delimited the categories of unprotected
speech. While we once declared that &quot;[l]ibelous utterances
[are] not ... within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct. 725, 735,
96 L.Ed. 919 (1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974),
and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472
U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), have substantially
qualified this broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed
the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception set forth in Chaplinsky
narrowly. See, e.g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct.
2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415
U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974); Cohen v. California,
403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In the case
of commercial speech, our ruling that &quot;the Constitution imposes
no ... restraint on government [regulation] as respects purely
commercial advertising,&quot; Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S.
52, 54, 62 S.Ct. 920, 921, 86 L.Ed. 1262 (1942), was expressly
repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976).
In short, the history of the categorical approach is largely the
history of narrowing the categories of unprotected speech.
<P>
This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical approach
is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of &quot;protected&quot;
and &quot;unprotected&quot; speech ultimately futile. My analysis
of the faults and limits of this approach persuades me that the
categorical approach presented in Part I-A of Justice WHITE's
opinion is not an adequate response to the novel &quot;underbreadth&quot;
analysis the Court sets forth today.
<P>
III
<P>
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and
part of Justice WHITE's analysis of the constitutionality St.
Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I do not believe that all content-based
regulations are equally infirm and presumptively invalid; unlike
Justice WHITE, I do not believe that fighting words are wholly
unprotected by the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe
our decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one
that considers the content and context of the regulated speech,
and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Applying
this analysis and assuming arguendo (as the Court does) that the
St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that such a selective,
subject-matter regulation on proscribable speech is constitutional.
<P>
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly
recognize that some content-based restrictions raise more constitutional
questions than others. Although the Court's analysis of content-based
regulations cannot be reduced to a simple formula, we have considered
a number of factors in determining the validity of such regulations.
<P>
First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided expressive
activity depends in part upon its content and character. We have
long recognized that when government regulates political speech
or &quot;the expression of editorial opinion on matters of public
importance,&quot; FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 375-376, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3114-3115, 82 L.Ed.2d 278
(1984), &quot;First Amendment protectio[n] is 'at its zenith.'
&quot; Meyer v. *2568 Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 425, 108 S.Ct. 1886,
1894, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recognized
that &quot;commercial speech receives a limited form of First
Amendment protection,&quot; Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 340, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986), and that &quot;society's interest
in protecting [sexually explicit films] is of a wholly different,
and lesser magnitude than [its] interest in untrammeled political
debate.&quot; Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at 70,
96 S.Ct., at 2452; see also FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). The character of expressive
 activity also weighs in our consideration of its constitutional
status. As we have frequently noted, &quot;[t]he government generally
has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has
in restricting the written or spoken word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989);
see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
The protection afforded expression turns as well on the context
of the regulated speech. We have noted, for example, that &quot;[a]ny
assessment of the precise scope of employer expression, of course,
must be made in the context of its labor relations setting ...
[and] must take into account the economic dependence of the employees
on their employers.&quot; NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S.,
at 617, 89 S.Ct., at 1942. Similarly, the distinctive character
of a university environment, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
277-280, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278-280, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environment,
see Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct.
592, 98 L.Ed.2d 562 (1988), influences our First Amendment analysis.
The same is true of the presence of a &quot; 'captive audience[,
one] there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' &quot; Lehman
v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S., at 302, 94 S.Ct., at 2717
(citation omitted). (FN6) Perhaps the most familiar embodiment
of the relevance of context is our &quot;fora&quot; jurisprudence,
differentiating the levels of protection afforded speech in different
locations.
<P>
The nature of a contested restriction of speech also informs our
evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for example, &quot;[a]ny
system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing
a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.&quot;
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631,
639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). More particularly to the matter of
content-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguished between
restrictions on expression based on subject matter and restrictions
based on viewpoint, indicating that the latter are particularly
pernicious. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at
414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544. &quot;Viewpoint discrimination is censorship
in its purest form,&quot; Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 62, 103 S.Ct. 948, 964, 74 L.Ed.2d
794 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular
scrutiny, in part because such regulation often indicates a legislative
effort to skew public debate on an issue. See, e.g., Schacht v.
United States, 398 U.S. 58, 63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559, 26 L.Ed.2d
44 (1970). &quot;Especially where ... the legislature's suppression
of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people,
the First Amendment is plainly offended.&quot; First National
Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407,
1420-1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). *2569 Thus, although a regulation
that on its face regulates speech by subject matter may in some
instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints, see, e.g.,
Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N.Y.,
447 U.S. 530, 546-547, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2338, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based
restrictions on expression require greater scrutiny than subject-matter
based restrictions. (FN7)
<P>
Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regulations
we have also looked more broadly at the scope of the restrictions.
For example, in Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
71, 96 S.Ct., at 2452-2453, we found significant the fact that
&quot;what [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than a
limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited.&quot;
Similarly, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the Court emphasized
two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling. First,
the ruling concerned only broadcast material which presents particular
problems because it &quot;confronts the citizen ... in the privacy
of the home&quot;; second, the ruling was not a complete ban on
the use of selected offensive words, but rather merely a limitation
on the times such speech could be broadcast. 438 U.S., at 748-750,
98 S.Ct., at 3039-3041.
<P>
All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of content-based
<P>
regulations on expression. Such a multi-faceted analysis cannot
be conflated into two dimensions. Whatever the allure of absolute
doctrines, it is just too simple to declare expression &quot;protected&quot;
or &quot;unprotected&quot; or to proclaim a regulation &quot;content-based&quot;
or &quot;content-neutral.&quot;
<P>
In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I assume
arguendo --as the Court does--that the ordinance regulates only
fighting words and therefore is not overbroad. Looking to the
content and character of the regulated activity, two things are
clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinance bars only low-value
speech, namely, fighting words. By definition such expression
constitutes &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and [is] of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be derived from [it] is clearly outweighed by
the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky, 315
U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Second, the ordinance regulates
&quot;expressive conduct [rather] than ... the written or spoken
word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406, 109 S.Ct., at
2540.
<P>
Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is again
significant that the statute (by hypothesis) regulates only fighting
words. Whether words are fighting words is determined in part
by their context. Fighting words are not words that merely cause
offense; fighting words must be directed at individuals so as
to &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury.&quot; By hypothesis,
then, the St. Paul ordinance restricts speech in confrontational
and potentially violent situations. The case at hand is illustrative.
The cross-burning in this case--directed as it was to a single
African-American family trapped in their home--was nothing more
than a crude form of physical intimidation. That this cross-burning
sends a message of racial hostility does not automatically endow
it with complete constitutional protection. (FN8) *2570 Significantly,
the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not on the basis of its
subject matter or the viewpoint expressed, but rather on the basis
of the harm the speech causes. In this regard, the Court fundamentally
misreads the St. Paul ordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul
ordinance as regulating expression &quot;addressed to one of [several]
specified disfavored topics,&quot; ante, at 2547 (emphasis supplied),
as policing &quot;disfavored subjects,&quot; ibid. (emphasis supplied),
and as &quot;prohibit[ing] ... speech solely on the basis of the
subjects the speech addresses.&quot; Ante, at 2542 (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulates only
a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based on &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; not a subcategory that
involves discussions that concern those characteristics. (FN9)
The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes expression
that &quot;one knows ... [by its very utterance inflicts injury
on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child pornography
law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled out child pornography
because those publications caused far greater harms than pornography
involving adults.
<P>
Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate fighting
words based on its subject matter, such a regulation would, in
my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above, subject-matter
based regulations on commercial speech are widespread and largely
unproblematic. As we have long recognized, subject-matter regulations
generally do not raise the same concerns of government censorship
and the distortion of public discourse presented by viewpoint
regulations. Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we
have carefully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not
implicated. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
67, 96 S.Ct., at 2450-2451 (emphasizing &quot;the need for absolute
neutrality by the government,&quot; and observing that the contested
statute was not animated by &quot;hostility for the point of view&quot;
of the theatres); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S., at 745-746,
98 S.Ct., at 3038-3039 (stressing that &quot;government must remain
neutral in the marketplace of ideas&quot;); see also FCC v. League
of Women's Voters of California, 468 U.S., at 412-417, 104 S.Ct.,
at 3134-3137 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 554-555, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2916-2917,
69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part).
<P>
Indeed, some subject-matter restrictions are a functional necessity
in contemporary governance: &quot;The First Amendment does not
require States to regulate for problems that do not exist.&quot;
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1856,
119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul ordinance
does not regulate expression based on viewpoint. The Court contends
that the ordinance requires proponents of racial intolerance to
&quot;follow the *2571. Marquis of Queensbury Rules&quot; while
allowing advocates of racial tolerance to &quot;fight freestyle.&quot;
The law does no such thing.
<P>
The Court writes:
<P>
&quot;One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all 'anti-Catholic
bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all 'papists' are, for that
would insult and provoke violence 'on the basis of religion.'
&quot; Ante, at 2548.
<P>
This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point. The
Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to a sign saying
that &quot;all [religious] bigots are misbegotten&quot; is a sign
saying that &quot;all advocates of religious tolerance are misbegotten.&quot;
Assuming such signs could be fighting words (which seems to me
extremely unlikely), neither sign would be banned by the ordinance
for the attacks were not &quot;based on ... religion&quot; but
rather on one's beliefs about tolerance. Conversely (and again
assuming such signs are fighting words), just as the ordinance
would prohibit a Muslim from hoisting a sign claiming that all
Catholics were misbegotten, so the ordinance would bar a Catholic
from hoisting a similar sign attacking Muslims.
<P>
The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle between advocates
of tolerance and advocates of intolerance, the ordinance does
not prevent either side from hurling fighting words at the other
on the basis of their conflicting ideas, but it does bar both
sides from hurling such words on the basis of the target's &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; To extend the Court's
pugilistic metaphor, the St. Paul ordinance simply bans punches
&quot;below the belt&quot;--by either party. It does not, therefore,
favor one side of any debate. (FN10)
<P>
Finally, it is noteworthy that the St. Paul ordinance is, as construed
by the Court today, quite narrow. The St. Paul ordinance does
not ban all &quot;hate speech,&quot; nor does it ban, say, all
cross-burnings or all swastika displays. Rather it only bans a
subcategory of the already narrow category of fighting words.
Such a limited ordinance leaves open and protected a vast range
of expression on the subjects of racial, religious, and gender
equality. As construed by the Court today, the ordinance certainly
does not &quot; 'raise the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.' &quot;
Ante, at 2545. Petitioner is free to burn a cross to announce
a rally or to express his views about racial supremacy, he may
do so on private property or public land, at day or at night,
so long as the burning is not so threatening and so directed at
an individual as to &quot;by its very [execution] inflict injury.&quot;
Such a limited proscription scarcely offends the First Amendment.
<P>
In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates
expressive activity that is wholly proscribable and does so not
on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recognition of the different
harms caused by such activity. Taken together, these several considerations
persuade me that the St. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional
content-based regulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not
overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

<P>
FN3. Contrary to Justice WHITE's suggestion, post, at 2550-2551,
petitioner's claim is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the questions
presented in the petition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule
14.1(a). It was clear from the petition and from petitioner's
other filings in this Court (and in the courts below) that his
assertion that the St. Paul ordinance &quot;violat[es] overbreadth
... principles of the First Amendment,&quot; Pet. for Cert. i,
was not just a technical &quot;overbreadth&quot; claim--i.e.,
a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third
parties--but included the contention that the ordinance was &quot;overbroad&quot;
in the sense of restricting more speech than the Constitution
permits, even in its application to him, because it is content-based.
An important component of petitioner's argument is, and has been
all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only
&quot;fighting words&quot; cannot cure this fundamental defect.
Id., at 12, 14, 15-16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner
argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1)
its boundaries were vague, Brief for Petitioner 26, and because
(2) denominating particular expression a &quot;fighting word&quot;
because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience
is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner
5; id., at 13 (&quot;[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory
and vague as 'narrowly construed' &quot;) (emphasis added). At
oral argument, counsel for Petitioner reiterated this second point:
&quot;It is ... one of my positions, that in [punishing only some
fighting words and not others], even though it is a subcategory,
technically, of unprotected conduct, [the ordinance] still is
picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making that
clear through the State.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting
our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our
criteria of what is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the petition.

*2571_ FN4. Justice WHITE concedes that a city council cannot
prohibit only those legally obscene works that contain criticism
of the city government, post, at 2555, but asserts that to be
the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal
Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not,
he asserts, &quot;be rationally related to a legitimate government
interest,&quot; ibid. But of course the only reason that government
interest is not a &quot;legitimate&quot; one is that it violates
the First Amendment. This Court itself has occasionally fused
the First Amendment into the Equal Protection Clause in this fashion,
but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice WHITE cannot
afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis.
See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct.
2286, 2289-2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting
only nonlabor picketing violated the Equal Protection Clause because
there was no &quot;appropriate governmental interest&quot; supporting
the distinction inasmuch as &quot;the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content&quot;);

<P>
Justice STEVENS seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion
of obscene anti-government speech as &quot;fantastical,&quot;
post, at 2562, apparently believing that any reference to politics
prevents a finding of obscenity. Unfortunately for the purveyors
of obscenity, that is obviously false. A shockingly hard core
pornographic movie that contains a model sporting a political
tattoo can be found, &quot;taken as a whole [to] lac[k] serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,&quot; Miller
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come
up with other illustrations of a content-based restriction upon
&quot;unprotected speech&quot; that is obviously invalid: the
anti-government libel illustration mentioned earlier, for one.
See supra, at 2543. And of course the concept of racist fighting
words is, unfortunately, anything but a &quot;highly speculative
hypothetica[l],&quot; post, at 2562.
<P>
FN5. Although Justice WHITE asserts that our analysis disregards
&quot;established principles of First Amendment law,&quot; post,
at 2560, he cites not a single case (and we are aware of none)
that even involved, much less considered and resolved, the issue
of content discrimination through regulation of &quot;unprotected&quot;
speech--though we plainly recognized that as an issue in Ferber.
It is of course contrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence
to consider the law on this point conclusively resolved by broad
language in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned.

FN6. Justice STEVENS cites a string of opinions as supporting
his assertion that &quot;selective regulation of speech based

with, three of them did not command a majority of the Court, Young

2440, 2448-2454, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); FCC v. Pacifica

Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).
In any event, all that their contents establish is what we readily
concede: that presumptive invalidity does not mean invariable
invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions as reasonable and
viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums,

*2571_ FN7. St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance
merely regulates that subclass of fighting words which is most
likely to provoke a violent response. But even if one assumes
(as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described,
that would not justify selective regulation under a &quot;secondary
effects&quot; theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct
would be especially correlated with violence is that it conveys
a particularly odious message; because the &quot;chain of causation&quot;
thus necessarily &quot;run[s] through the persuasive effect of
the expressive component&quot; of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2470-2471, 115 L.Ed.2d
504 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that
the St. Paul ordinance regulates on the basis of the &quot;primary&quot;
effect of the speech--i.e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.
<P>

earlier this Term in Burson v.
<P>
Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
In light of the &quot;logical connection&quot; between electioneering
and the State's compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation
and election fraud--an inherent connection borne out by a &quot;long
history&quot; and a &quot;wide-spread and time-tested consensus,&quot;
id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1855-1858--the plurality concluded
that it was facd with one of those &quot;rare case[s]&quot; in
which the use of a facially content-based restriction was justified
by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas, id., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1857-1858; see also id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
1859 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Justice WHITE and Justice STEVENS
are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to convert the Burson
plurality's passing comment that &quot;[t]he First Amendment does
not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856, into endorsement of the revolutionary
proposition that the suppression of particular ideas can be justified
when only those ideas have been a source of trouble in the past.

&quot;1. May a local government enact a content-based, 'hate-crime'
ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols, including a Nazi
swastika or a burning cross, on public or private property, which
one knows or has reason to know arouses anger, alarm, or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender
without violating overbreadth and vagueness principles of the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution?
<P>
&quot;2. Can the constitutionality of such a vague and substantially
overbroad content-based restraint of expression be saved by a
limiting construction, like that used to save the vague and overbroad
content-neutral laws, restricting its application to 'fighting
words' or 'imminent lawless action?' &quot; Pet. for Cert. i.
<P>
It has long been the rule of this Court that &quot;[o]nly the
questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,
will be considered by the Court.&quot; This Court's Rule 14.1(a).
This Rule has served to focus the issues presented for review.
But the majority reads the Rule so expansively that any First
Amendment theory would appear to be &quot;fairly included&quot;
within the questions quoted above.
<P>
Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through
its selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 2542,
n. 3, petitioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota
Supreme Court anything approximating the novel theory the majority
adopts today. Most certainly petitioner did not &quot;reiterat[e]&quot;
such a claim at argument; he responded to a question from the
bench. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Previously, this Court has shown the
restraint to refrain from deciding cases on the basis of its own
theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by a state
court of last resort. See, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
217-224, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2321-2325, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).
<P>
Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf.
Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Serv. Comm'n,
461 U.S. 375, 382, n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, n. 6, 76 L.Ed.2d
1 (1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential
concerns are sufficiently weighty that we would never have granted
certiorari, had petitioner sought review of a question based on
the majority's decisional theory.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. &quot;In each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected
category, as well as the unprotected character of particular communications,
have been determined by the judicial evaluation of special facts
that have been deemed to have constitutional significance.&quot;
Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.
485, 504-505, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961-1962, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1948).
<P>
FN3. The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule
belies the majority's claim, see ante, at 2545, that its new theory
is truly concerned with content discrimination. See Part I(C),
infra (discussing the exceptions).
<P>
FN4. This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always
unprotected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost
certainly be protected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U.S. 444, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1828, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). But
in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized
as a &quot;direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange
fisticuffs,&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), to which the fighting words
doctrine, see Part II, infra, applies.
<P>
FN5. The majority relies on Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
1157, 99
<P>
L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), in arguing that the availability of content-neutral
alternatives &quot; 'undercut[s] significantly' &quot; a claim
that content-based
<P>
legislation is &quot; 'necessary to serve the asserted [compelling]
interest.' &quot; Ante, at 2549-2550 (quoting Boos, supra, at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168, and Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (plurality)). Boos does
not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already
had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary,
and the Court pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U.S., at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168. St. Paul lawmakers have made no such
legislative choice.
<P>
Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute
was not narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative
was available. Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos
inside-out by substituting the majority's policy judgment that
a more restrictive alternative could adequately serve the compelling
need identified by St. Paul lawmakers. The result would be: (a)
a statute that was not tailored to fit the need identified by
the government; and (b) a greater restriction on fighting words,
even though the Court clearly believes that fighting words have
protected expressive content. Ante, at 2544.
<P>
FN6. Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating members
of the Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon
&amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991), in which we struck down New York's &quot;Son of Sam&quot;
law, which required &quot;that an accused or convicted criminal's
income from works describing his crime be deposited in an escrow
account.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 504.
<P>
FN7. The Burson dissenters did not complain that the plurality
erred in applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality
was not sufficiently rigorous in its review. 504 U.S., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1865 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
<P>
FN8. Justice SCALIA concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning
that the statute, &quot;though content-based, is constitutional
[as] a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1848. However, nothing
in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a content-based
ban on fighting words would be constitutional were that ban limited
to nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that,
in some settings, political speech, to which &quot;the First Amendment
'has its fullest and most urgent application,' &quot; is entitled
to less constitutional protection than fighting words. Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223,
109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting Monitor
Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d
35 (1971)).
<P>
*2571_ FN9. The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on
obscene works critical of government would fail equal protection
review only because the ban would violate the First Amendment.
Ante, at 2541, n. 2. While decisions such as Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972),
recognize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an
equal protection claim challenging distinctions that impact on
protected expression, id., at 95-99, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292, there
is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis
in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one need
not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the
sort of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based
on senseless distinctions.
<P>
FN10. Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because
it distinguishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.
<P>
FN11. The consequences of the majority's conflation of the rarely-used
secondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating
&quot;speech&quot; and &quot;nonspeech&quot; elements, see generally
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), present another question that
I fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of
the majority's opinion.
<P>
FN12. Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia
v. American Bookseller's Assn., 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S.Ct. 636,
645, 98 L.Ed.2d
<P>
782 (1988), that &quot;the statute must be 'readily susceptible'
to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform
it to constitutional requirements.&quot; In American Bookseller's,
no state court had construed the language in dispute. In that
instance, we certified a question to the state court so that it
would have an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation.
Ibid. In Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216,
95 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), the other case upon
which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that
the ordinance at issue was not &quot;by its plain terms ... easily
susceptible of a narrowing construction,&quot; but that the state
courts had made no effort to restrict the scope of the statute
when it was challenged on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
FN13. Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech,
Johnson v. Texas, 491 U.S., at 414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544, it does
not require us to be subjected to such expression at all times,
in all settings. We have held that such expression may be proscribed
when it intrudes upon a &quot;captive audience.&quot; Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484-485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2502-2503, 101
L.Ed.2d 420 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726,
748-749, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3040-3041, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). And
expression may be limited when it merges into conduct. United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672
(1968); cf. Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106
S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). However, because of the
manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed the St.
Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.
<P>
FN1. The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted
two exceptions, one for &quot;certain media or markets&quot; and
the other for content discrimination based upon &quot;the very
reason that the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot;
Ante, at 2545. These exceptions are, at best, ill-defined. The
Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former, fighting
words such as cross-burning could be proscribed only in certain
neighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe,
or whether, with respect to the second category, fighting words
that create a particular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would
be proscribable. The hypothetical and illusory category of these
two exceptions persuades me that either my description of the
Court's analysis is accurate or that the Court does not in fact
mean much of what it says in its opinion.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct.
1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d
464 (1961).
<P>
FN3. See also Packer Corp v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 52 S.Ct. 273,
76 L.Ed. 643 (1932) (Brandeis, J.) (upholding a statute that prohibited
the advertisement of cigarettes on billboards and street-car placards).
<P>
FN4. The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations
&quot;applies differently in the context of proscribable speech&quot;
than in the context of other speech, ante, at 2545, but its analysis
belies that claim. The Court strikes down the St. Paul ordinance
because it regulates fighting words based on subject matter, despite
the fact that, as demonstrated above, we have long upheld regulations
of commercial speech based on subject matter. The Court's self-description
is inapt: By prohibiting the regulation of fighting words based
on its subject matter, the Court provides the same protection
to fighting words as is currently provided to core political speech.
<P>
FN5. &quot;A word,&quot; as Justice Holmes has noted, &quot;is
not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a
living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according
to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.&quot; Towne
v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 159, 62 L.Ed. 372
(1918); see also Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 201, 84 S.Ct.
1676, 1685, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Warren, C.J., dissenting).
<P>
FN6. Cf. In re Chase, 468 F.2d 128, 139-140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious
belief, refused to rise and stand as the trial judge entered the
courtroom was not subject to contempt proceedings because he was
not present in the courtroom &quot;as a matter of choice&quot;).
<P>
FN7. Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matter
based and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic,
see, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n
of N.Y., 447 U.S., at 537, 100 S.Ct., at 2338, our decisions belie
such claims.
<P>
FN8. The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance
as regulating &quot;a message.&quot; Ante, at 2548. As always,
however, St. Paul's argument must be read in context:
<P>
&quot;Finally, we ask the Court to reflect on the 'content' of
the 'expressive conduct' represented by a 'burning cross.' It
is no less than the first step in an act of racial violence. It
was and unfortunately still is the equivalent of [the] waving
of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gun before it
is fired, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hanging
of the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement,
or even a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the first step in
an act of assault. It can be no more protected than holding a
gun to a victim['s] head. It is perhaps the ultimate expression
of 'fighting words.' &quot; App. to Brief for Petitioner C-6.
<P>
FN9. The Court contends that this distinction is &quot;wordplay,&quot;
reasoning that &quot;[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based
threats] distinct from [the harms] produced by other fighting
words is ... the fact that [the former are] caused by a distinctive
idea.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis added). In this way, the Court
concludes that regulating speech based on the injury it causes
is no different from regulating speech based on its subject matter.
This analysis fundamentally miscomprehends the role of &quot;race,
color, creed, religion [and] gender&quot; in contemporary American
society. One need look no further than the recent social unrest
in the Nation's cities to see that race-based threats may cause
more harm to society and to individuals than other threats. Just
as the statute prohibiting threats against the President is justifiable
because of the place of the President in our social and political
order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threats is justifiable
because of the place of race in our social and political order.
Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and
is so incendiary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that
condition, laws such as St. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable
and justifiable.
<P>
*2571_ FN10. Cf. FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 418, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3137, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (&quot;In this case ... the regulation
applies ... to a defined class of ... licensees [who] represent
heterogenous points of view. There is simply no sensible basis
for considering this regulation a viewpoint restriction--or ...
to condemn it as 'content-based'--because it applies equally to
station owners of all shades of opinion&quot;

Ronald W. ROSENBERGER, et al., Petitioners v.
<P>
RECTOR AND VISITORS OF the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA et al.
<P>
No. 94-329.
<P>
Supreme Court of the United States
<P>
Argued March 1, 1995.
<P>
Decided June 29, 1995.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2511
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes
payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors
for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by
student groups called &quot;Contracted Independent Organizations&quot;
(CIOs). The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees
and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student
activities related to the University's educational purpose. CIOs
must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written
materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the
University and that the University is not responsible for them.
The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer
on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely
because its student newspaper, Wide Awake:
<P>
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, *2512 &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality,&quot; as prohibited by the University's
SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment
violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
<P>
After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University,
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation
of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated
the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was
justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
Held:
<P>
1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their
right of free speech. Pp. 2516-2520.
<P>
(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47,
103 S.Ct. 948, 955-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794. In determining whether
a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has
set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech
there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957,
this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand,
content discrimination-- i.e., discrimination against speech because
of its subject matter--which may be permissible if it preserves
the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination--i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective--which is
presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise
within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46, 103 S.Ct., at
955. The most recent and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's
Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 124 L.Ed.2d 352, in which the Court
held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation
of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious
standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here,
as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted
as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible
line-drawing based on content:
<P>
By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does
not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored
treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints. Pp. 2516-2518.
<P>
(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds
rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may
regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when
it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233;
<P>
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278,
70 L.Ed.2d 440, the University may not discriminate based on the
viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan
v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548, 103
S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 76 L.Ed.2d 129. Its argument that the scarcity
of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong. Pp. 2518-2520.
<P>
(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term &quot;promotes&quot;
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic
position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or
ultimate reality, while the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing
the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality.
It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would
be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection
to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. 2519-2520.
<P>
2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying
with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2525.
<P>
(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs
in *2513 the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee
of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows
neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to
recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints,
<P>
including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed.
of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481,
2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546. There is no suggestion that the University
created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause.
The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support
various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers,
in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.
The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do
not make third-party payments on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot;
and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial
viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a &quot;student
... communications ... grou[p].&quot; Neutrality is also apparent
in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The program's
neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied
for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which
would violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2523.
<P>
(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer
v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow
directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue. A public
university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants
access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide
spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would
use the facilities for devotional exercises. See e.g., Widmar,
454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities is paid out
of a student activities fund to which students are required to
contribute. Id., at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272. There is no difference
in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional
significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to
which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor
to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved
here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum
of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the
University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing
the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious
message. Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the
Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision
of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis. Pp. 2523-2525.

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth
for which it is named and thus bound by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for
the printing costs of a variety of student publications. It withheld
any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; That the paper did promote or manifest views within
the defined exclusion seems plain enough. The challenge is to
the University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the
case raising issues under the Speech and Establishment Clauses
of the First Amendment.
<P>

<P>
The public corporation we refer to as the &quot;University&quot;
is denominated by state law as &quot;the Rector and Visitors of
the University of Virginia,&quot; Va.Code Ann. Sec. 23-69 (1993),
and it is responsible for governing the school, see Secs. 23-69
to 23-80. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him,
together with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence
and of the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Sec.
57-1, as one of his proudest achievements, the University is among
the Nation's oldest and most respected seats of higher learning.
It has more than 11,000 undergraduate students, and 6,000 graduate
and professional students. An understanding of the case requires
a somewhat detailed description of the program the University
created to support extracurricular student activities on its campus.
<P>
Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its outside
contractors for payment by the fund described below, it must become
a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot; (CIO). CIO status
is available to any group the majority of whose members are students,
whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that complies
with certain procedural requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.
A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must pledge
not to discriminate in its membership; and must include in dealings
with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer,
stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that
the University is not responsible for the CIO. App. 27-28. CIOs
enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms
and computer terminals. Id., at 30. A standard agreement signed
between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits
and opportunities afforded to CIOs &quot;should not be misinterpreted
as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled
by the University, that the University is responsible for the
organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the
University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.&quot;
Id., at 26.
<P>
All CIOs may exist and operate at the University, but some are
also entitled to apply for funds from the Student Activities Fund
(SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the
purpose of the SAF is to support a broad range of extracurricular
student activities that &quot;are related to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is
based on the University's &quot;recogni[tion] that the availability
of a wide range of opportunities&quot; for its students &quot;tends
to enhance the University environment.&quot; App. 26. The Guidelines
require that it be administered &quot;in a manner consistent with
the educational purpose of the University as well as with state
and federal law.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives
its money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to
each full-time student. The Student Council, elected by the students,
has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions
are subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee
of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Cf. id., at 63a-64a.
<P>
Some, but not all, CIOs may submit disbursement requests to the
SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories of student groups
that may seek payment to third-party contractors because they
&quot;are related to the educational purpose of the University
of Virginia.&quot; Id., at 61a-62a. One of these is &quot;student
news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications
media groups.&quot;
<P>
Id., at 61a. The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs
of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for
funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activities
which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,
philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,
activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt status,
those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social
entertainment or related expenses. Id., at 62a-63a. The prohibition
on &quot;political activities&quot; is defined so that it is limited
to electioneering and lobbying. The Guidelines provide that &quot;[t]hese
restrictions on funding political activities are not intended
to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization
which ... espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints,
including those that may be *2515 unpopular or are not generally
accepted.&quot; Id., at 65a-66a. A &quot;religious activity,&quot;
by contrast, is defined as any activity that &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; Id., at 66a.
<P>
The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining the amounts
of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on behalf of
each eligible student organization: the size of the group, its
financial self-sufficiency, and the University-wide benefit of
its activities. If an organization seeks SAF support, it must
submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the organization's
creditors upon determining that the expenses are appropriate.
No direct payments are made to the student groups. During the
1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIOs.
One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the SAF,
and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups were funded as
&quot;student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic
communications media groups.&quot;
<P>
Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), qualified
as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other undergraduates
in 1990, WAP was established &quot;[t]o publish a magazine of
philosophical and religious expression,&quot; &quot;[t]o facilitate
discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance
of Christian viewpoints,&quot; and &quot;[t]o provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.&quot; App.
67. WAP publishes Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University
of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from
the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal &quot;offers
a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues,
especially those relevant to college students at the University
of Virginia.&quot; App. 45. The editors committed the paper to
a two-fold mission: &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage
students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
means.&quot; Ibid. The first issue had articles about racism,
crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil
and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two
issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian
missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors. Each page of Wide Awake,
and the end of each article or review, is marked by a cross. The
advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the Christian
perspective of the journal. For the most part, the advertisers
are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores.
By June 1992, WAP had distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake
to University students, free of charge.
<P>
WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This
is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a
&quot;religious organization,&quot; WAP would not have been accorded
CIO status. As defined by the Guidelines, a &quot;religious organization&quot;
is &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University
contended that WAP is such an organization.
<P>
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF
to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of printing its newspaper.
The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's
request on the ground that Wide Awake was a &quot;religious activity&quot;
within the meaning of the Guidelines, i.e., that the newspaper
&quot;promote[d] or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; Ibid. It made its determination
after examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial
to the full Stud ent Council, contending that WAP met all the
applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis
of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.
The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed
to the next level, the Student Activities Committee. In a letter
signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial
of funding. App. 55.
<P>
Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP,
Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in
*2516 the United States District Court for the Western District
of Virginia, challenging the SAF's action as violative of Rev.Stat.
Sec. 1979, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize
payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the
basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights
to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise of religion,
and to equal protection of the law. They relied also upon Article
I of the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs. 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp.1994), but
did not pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages
for the costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory
relief, and attorney's fees.
<P>
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled
for the University, holding that denial of SAF support was not
an impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against petitioners'
speech, and that the University's Establishment Clause concern
over its &quot;religious activities&quot; was a sufficient justification
for denying payment to third-party contractors. The court did
not issue a definitive ruling on whether reimbursement, had it
been made here, would or would not have violated the Establishment
Clause. 795 F.Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va.1992).
<P>
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guidelines
did discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that, while
the State need not underwrite speech, there was a presumptive
violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was
invoked to deny third-party payment otherwise available to CIOs.
18 F.3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the District Court nonetheless, concluding that the
discrimination by the University was justified by the &quot;compelling
interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state.&quot;
Id., at 281.
<P>
II
<P>
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based
on its substantive content or the message it conveys. Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33
L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Other principles follow from this precept.
In the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation
may not favor one speaker over another. City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2128,
80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of
its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458-2459,
129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). These rules informed our determination
that the government offends the First Amendment when it imposes
financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of
their expression. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 507-508,
116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). When the government targets not subject
matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the
violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. See
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 S.Ct. 2538, ----, 120
L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious
form of content discrimination. The government must abstain from
regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the
opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the
restriction. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
<P>
These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from
exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public
forum is one of its own creation. In a case involving a school
district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we
declared that &quot;[t]here is no question that the District,
like the private owner of property, may legally preserve the property
under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.&quot;
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).
The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate
purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving
it for certain groups or for the discussion *2517 of certain topics.
See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,
473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985);
Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. Once it has
opened a limited forum, however, the State must respect the lawful
boundaries it has itself set. The State may not exclude speech
where its distinction is not &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum,&quot; Cornelius, supra, at 804-806,
105 S.Ct. at 3450-51; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46,
49, 103 S.Ct., at 955, 957, nor may it discriminate against speech
on the basis of its viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2147; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103
S.Ct., at 955; R.A.V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393, 112 S.Ct.,
at ---- - ----, ---- - ----; cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397,
414-415, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits
of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of
speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between,
on the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible
if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the
other hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible
when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations.
See Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955.
<P>
The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or
geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable. See,
e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47, 103 S.Ct., at 955-956
(forum analysis of a school mail system); Cornelius, supra, at
801, 105 S.Ct., at 3448 (forum analysis of charitable contribution
program). The most recent and most apposite case is our decision
in Lamb's Chapel, supra. There, a school district had opened school
facilities for use after school hours by community groups for
a wide variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. The
district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening
facilities to groups for religious purposes. Invoking its policy,
the district rejected a request from a group desiring to show
a film series addressing various child-rearing questions from
a &quot;Christian perspective.&quot; There was no indication in
the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the school
facilities was &quot;denied for any reason other than the fact
that the presentation would have been from a religious perspective.&quot;
508 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2145. Our conclusion was
unanimous: &quot;[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint
to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all
views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing
with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.&quot; Ibid.
<P>
The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our precedents)
that &quot;ideologically driven attempts to suppress a particular
point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in funding, as
in other contexts,&quot; but insists that this case does not present
that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on content,
not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10. As we have noted,
discrimination against one set of views or ideas is but a subset
or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content
discrimination.
<P>
See, e.g., R.A.V., supra, at 391, 112 S.Ct., at ----. And, it
must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise one. It
is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious
thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a
comprehensive body of thought. The nature of our origins and destiny
and their dependence upon the existence of a divine being have
been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human history.
We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel, viewpoint
discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's
objections to Wide Awake. By the very terms of the SAF prohibition,
the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but
selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts
with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area
of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise,
a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may
be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the
general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party
payments, for the subjects discussed were *2518 otherwise within
the approved category of publications.
<P>
The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs
because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of
viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate
is bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response
to religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted
nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description
of the marketplace of ideas. If the topic of debate is, for example,
racism, then exclusion of several views on that problem is just
as offensive to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one.
It is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic
perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other,
or yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint. The dissent's
declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices
are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple
ways.
<P>
The University's denial of WAP's request for third-party payments
in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not
unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in Lamb's
Chapel and that we found invalid. The church group in Lamb's Chapel
would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save
for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just as the school district
in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views of
the group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in this
case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation
to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake reveal an
avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 2515. It bears only
passing mention that the dissent's attempt to distinguish Lamb's
Chapel is entirely without support in the law. Relying on the
transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to argue that we
found viewpoint discrimination in that case because the government
excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed
in the forum there. Post, at 2550-2551, and n. 13. The Court relied
on no such distinction in holding that discriminating against
religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.
There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which, unlike
an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law) that exclusion
or inclusion of other religious or antireligious voices from that
forum had any bearing on its decision.
<P>
The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding
in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision
of funds rather than access to facilities. The University begins
with the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial
discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to
accomplish its educational mission. Citing our decisions in Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991),
Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540,

454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the University
argues that content-based funding decisions are both inevitable
and lawful. Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding
decisions as well as to those involving access to facilities,
it is urged, its holding &quot;would become a judicial juggernaut,
constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that
schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make
in the allocation of public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents
16.
<P>
To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v.
Vincent, supra. There, in the course of striking down a public
university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school
facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated:
&quot;Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic
judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources.&quot; 454
U.S., at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277. The quoted language in Widmar
was but a proper recognition of the principle that when the State
is the speaker, it may make content-based choices. When the University
determines the content of the education it provides, it is the
University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate
the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker
or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message.
In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, *2519 supra, we upheld
the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable
to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling.
There, the government did not create a program to encourage private
speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific
information pertaining to its own program. We recognized that
when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular
policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S.,
at 194, 111 S.Ct., at 1773. When the government disburses public
funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it
may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message
is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee. See id., at 196-200,
111 S.Ct., at 1774-1776.
<P>
It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar,
that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University
does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
from private speakers. A holding that the University may not discriminate
based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates
does not restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled
by different principles. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356,
2372, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990); Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,
484 U.S. 260, 270-272, 108 S.Ct. 562, 569-570, 98 L.Ed.2d 592
(1988). For that reason, the University's reliance on Regan v.
Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, is inapposite as
well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant
tax deductions for contributions made to veterans' groups engaged
in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to other charities
which pursued lobbying efforts. Although acknowledging that the
Government is not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental
rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, 103 S.Ct., at 2001, we reaffirmed
the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision
of financial benefits by observing that &quot;[t]he case would
be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its
subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous
ideas,' &quot; see id., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002 (quoting Cammarano
v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S.Ct. 524, 533, 3 L.Ed.2d
462 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513,
519, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Regan relied
on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain speakers--veterans
organizations--and not a distinction based on the content or messages
of those groups' speech. 461 U.S., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002;
cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. The University's
regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction
as its sole rationale and operative principle.
<P>
The distinction between the University's own favored message and
the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.
The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction
in the agreement each CIO must sign. See supra, at 2. The University
declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are
not the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and
are not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party
contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own
messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected
viewpoints.
<P>
The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding
of speech differs from provision of access to facilities because
money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond the fact
that in any given case this proposition might not be true as an
empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could
discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its
availability is wrong as well. The government cannot justify viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of
scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been scarce,
had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision would
have been no different. It would have been incumbent on the State,
of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on some
acceptable neutral principle; but nothing in our decision indicated
that scarcity would give the State the right to *2520 exercise
viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.
<P>
Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to
examine publications to determine whether or not they are based
on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them.
The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling
of individual thought and expression. That danger is especially
real in the University setting, where the State acts against a
background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at
the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See
Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ.
of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683-684, 17 L.Ed.2d
629 (1967);
<P>
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211-1212,
1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957). In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered
into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna,
Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous
assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and
to learn. See generally R. Palmer &amp; J. Colton, A History of
the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The quality and creative power
of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure
of a school's influence and attainment. For the University, by
regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its
students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry
in one of the vital centers for the nation's intellectual life,
its college and university campuses.
<P>
The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party contractor
payments on behalf of WAP effects a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry in the context of University sponsored
publications. The prohibition on funding on behalf of publications
that &quot;primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f]
in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; in its ordinary
and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach. The term
&quot;promotes&quot; as used here would comprehend any writing
advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in
a deity or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining &quot;promote&quot; as &quot;to
contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further,
encourage&quot;). And the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable
as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a
deity or ultimate reality. See id., at 1375 (defining &quot;manifest&quot;
as &quot;to show plainly: make palpably evident or certain by
showing or displaying&quot;). Were the prohibition applied with
much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical
student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. And
if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which
primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity
and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx,
Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some
of their major essays excluded from student publications. If any
manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the
writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on
making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point
out their (necessary) imperfections.
<P>
Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the regulation
invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application
to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment. It remains to be considered
whether the violation following from the University's action is
excused by the necessity of complying with the Constitution's
prohibition against state establishment of religion. We turn to
that question.
<P>
III
<P>
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the University had
argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of WAP's
contractors in SAF funding authorization would violate the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, that is *2521 the ground on which the University
prevailed in the Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari on this
question: &quot;Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state
university to exclude an otherwise eligible student publication
from participation in the student activities fund, solely on the
basis of its religious viewpoint, where such exclusion would violate
the Speech and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication
were nonreligious.&quot; Pet. for Cert. i. The University now
seems to have abandoned this position, contending that &quot;[t]he
fundamental objection to petitioners' argument is not that it
implicates the Establishment Clause but that it would defeat the
ability of public education at all levels to control the use of
public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents 29; see id., at 27-29,
and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University itself no
longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is some indication
that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals rested its judgment
on the point and our dissenting colleagues would find it determinative,
it must be addressed.
<P>
The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF support from Wide
Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but
proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by
the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause,
an interest it found compelling. 18 F.3d, at 281. Recognizing
that this Court has regularly &quot;sanctioned awards of direct
nonmonetary benefits to religious groups where the government
has created open fora to which all similarly situated organizations
are invited,&quot; 18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at
277, 102 S.Ct., at 278), the Fourth Circuit asserted that direct
monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects
is &quot;a beast of an entirely different color,&quot; 18 F.3d,
at 286. The court declared that the Establishment Clause would
not permit the use of public funds to support &quot; 'a specifically
religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.'
&quot; Id., at 285 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743,
93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973) (emphasis deleted)).
It reasoned that because Wide Awake is &quot;a journal pervasively
devoted to the discussion and advancement of an avowedly Christian
theological and personal philosophy,&quot; the University's provision
of SAF funds for its publication would &quot;send an unmistakably
clear signal that the University of Virginia supports Christian
values and wishes to promote the wide promulgation of such values.&quot;
18 F.3d, at 286.
<P>
If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause retains
its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was
intended to prohibit, we must in each case inquire first into
the purpose and object of the governmental action in question
and then into the practical details of the program's operation.
Before turning to these matters, however, we can set forth certain
general principles that must bear upon our determination.
<P>
A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor
in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment
Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have decided
a series of cases addressing the receipt of government benefits
where religion or religious views are implicated in some degree.
The first case in our modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence
was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504,
91 L.Ed. 711 (1947). There we cautioned that in enforcing the
prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion,
we must &quot;be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the
government] from extending its general state law benefits to all
its citizens without regard to their religious belief.&quot; Id.,
at 16, 67 S.Ct., at 512. We have held that the guarantee of neutrality
is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral
criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients
whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are
broad and diverse. See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School
Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491, 129
L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (SOUTER, J.) (&quot;[T]he principle is well
grounded in our case law [and] we have frequently relied explicitly
on the general availability of any benefit provided religious
groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges&quot;);
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 *2522 U.S.
481, 487-488, 106 S.Ct. 748, 751, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 398-399, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 3069, 77 L.Ed.2d
721 (1983); Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274-275, 102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
More than once have we rejected the position that the Establishment
Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal to extend
free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broad-reaching
government programs neutral in design. See Lamb's Chapel, 508
U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147-2148; Mergens, 496 U.S., at
248, 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2370-2371, 2373; Widmar, supra, at 274-275,
102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There
is no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion
or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a
religious cause. The object of the SAF is to open a forum for
speech and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The University's SAF Guidelines have
a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments
on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot; which are those
&quot;whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged
ultimate reality or deity.&quot; Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category
of support here is for &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communications media groups,&quot;
of which Wide Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did
not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;
it sought funding as a student journal, which it was.
<P>
The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from
a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches.
A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to Establishment
Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the Republic.
The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the levying of
taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing
and supporting specific sects. The exaction here, by contrast,
is a student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that
student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of
wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression is
an integral part of the University's educational mission. The
fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether
an objecting student has the First Amendment right to demand a
pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to
which he or she does not subscribe. See Keller v. State Bar of
California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 2237, 110 L.Ed.2d
1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 235-236,
97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977). We must treat it,
then, as an exaction upon the students. But the $14 paid each
semester by the students is not a general tax designed to raise
revenue for the University. See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.
1, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (&quot;A tax, in
the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution,
signifies an exaction for the support of the Government&quot;);
see also Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596, 5 S.Ct. 247,
252, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited
purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one
religion. Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes
to a special fund from which any group of students with CIO status
can draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational
mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech,
withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech,
whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view,
or neither. Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an
expenditure from a general tax fund. Here, the disbursements from
the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that
which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and
effected to provide financial support for a church.
<P>
Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme
in a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical
difference &quot;between government speech endorsing religion,
which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.&quot;
Mergens, supra, *2523 at 250, 110 S.Ct., at 2372 (opinion of O'CONNOR,
J.). In this case, &quot;the government has not willfully fostered
or encouraged&quot; any mistaken impression that the student newspapers
speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, --- L.Ed.2d
---- (slip op., at 10). The University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The Court
of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's religious orientation
would be attributed to the University is not a plausible fear,
and there is no real likelihood that the speech in question is
being either endorsed or coerced by the State, see Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992);
Witters, supra, at 489, 106 S.Ct., at 752-753 (citing Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1367, 79 L.Ed.2d
604 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)); see also Witters, supra,
at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690, 104
S.Ct., at 1368 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)).
<P>
The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract
from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special
Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615,
108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988); Hunt v. McNair,
413 U.S., at 742, 93 S.Ct. at 2874; Tilton, 403 U.S., at 679-680,
91 S.Ct., at 2096; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968).
The error is not in identifying the principle but in believing
that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no different
from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious
exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the
Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before
it, and the dissent would have us do the same. We do not confront
a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian
recipients, the government is making direct money payments to
an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity.
Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes
sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds
flow directly to WAP's coffers.
<P>
It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university
to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis
to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use
meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional
exercises. See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274; Mergens,
496 U.S., at 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2373. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities attributed to
those uses is paid from a student activities fund to which students
are required to contribute. Widmar, supra, at 265, 102 S.Ct.,
at 272. The government usually acts by spending money. Even the
provision of a meeting room, as in Mergens and Widmar, involved
governmental expenditure, if only in the form of electricity and
heating or cooling costs. The error made by the Court of Appeals,
as well as by the dissent, lies in focusing on the money that
is undoubtedly expended by the government, rather than on the
nature of the benefit received by the recipient. If the expenditure
of governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay for
a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used
by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's
Chapel would have to be overruled. Given our holdings in these
cases, it follows that a public university may maintain its own
computer facility and give student groups access to that facility,
including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say
first-come-first-served, basis. If a religious student organization
obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and used a computer
to compose or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a
religious content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing
the group with access would no more violate the Establishment
Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly hall.
See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 *2524 (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens,
supra. There is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference
of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds
to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school
paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. The latter occurs here. The University provides printing
services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as
CIOs by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to
religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular
services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing
is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student life.
<P>
By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a further
degree of separation from the student publication, for it avoids
the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep, repair,
and replacement attributable to student use, and has a clear record
of costs. As a result, and as in Widmar, the University can charge
the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity
in question. It would be formalistic for us to say that the University
must forfeit these advantages and provide the services itself
in order to comply with the Establishment Clause. It is, of course,
true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing
it, and we must guard against this abuse. That is not a danger
here, based on the considerations we have advanced and for the
additional reason that the student publication is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used
in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used
in the University's own regulations. It is instead a publication
involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that
would be both incomplete and chilled were the Constitution to
be interpreted to require that state officials and courts scan
the publication to ferret out views that principally manifest
a belief in a divine being.
<P>
Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the University,
in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to scrutinize the
content of student speech, lest the expression in question--speech
otherwise protected by the Constitution--contain too great a religious
content. The dissent, in fact, anticipates such censorship as
&quot;crucial&quot; in distinguishing between &quot;works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve.&quot; Post,
at 2550. That eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship,
to ensure that all student writings and publications meet some
baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard
on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources
of free speech and expression. As we recognized in Widmar, official
censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment
Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular
printing services on a religion-blind basis.
<P>
&quot;[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [between
'religious' speech and speech 'about' religion] has intelligible
content. There is no indication when 'singing hymns, reading scripture,
and teaching biblical principles' cease to be 'singing, teaching,
and reading'--all apparently forms of 'speech,' despite their
religious subject matter--and become unprotected 'worship.' ...
<P>
&quot;[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principled line,
it is highly doubtful that it would lie within the judicial competence
to administer. Merely to draw the distinction would require the
university--and ultimately the courts--to inquire into the significance
of words and practices to different religious faiths, and in varying
circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably
to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our
cases. E.g., Walz [v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) ].&quot; 454 U.S., at 269-270,
n. 6, 102 S.Ct., at 274, n. 6 (citations omitted).
<P>
* * *
<P>
To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the
University to deny eligibility to student publications because
of their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded of the State by the
separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the
*2525 University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination
inherent in the University's regulation required public officials
to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying
philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief.
That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech
and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion,
which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause
requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's
honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause.
<P>
The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice O'CONNOR, concurring.
<P>
&quot;We have time and again held that the government generally
may not treat people differently based on the God or gods they
worship, or don't worship.&quot; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village
School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2497,
129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). This insistence on government neutrality toward
religion explains why we have held that schools may not discriminate
against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities
that the schools make available to all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct.
269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). Withholding access would leave an
impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:
&quot;the message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;
if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open
to others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility
toward religion.&quot; Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2371,
110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (plurality opinion). &quot;The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they
provide no warrant for discriminating against religion.&quot;
Kiryas Joel, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2498 (O'CONNOR, J.).
Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
As Justice SOUTER demonstrates, however, post, at 2535-2537, there
exists another axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment
Clause. &quot;Public funds may not be used to endorse the religious
message.&quot; Bowen v.
<P>
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 642, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 2592, 101 L.Ed.2d

<P>
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also id., at 622, 108 S.Ct., at
2581
<P>
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Our cases have permitted some government
funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations.
See, e.g., id., at 617, 108 S.Ct. at 2578 (funding for sex education);
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 741, 96 S.Ct.
2337, 2342, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976)

Bradfield v.
<P>
Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, 299-300, 20 S.Ct. 121, 124, 44 L.Ed. 168
(1899) (funding of health care for indigent patients). These decisions,
however, provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance
religious activities.
<P>
This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government
neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities.
It is clear that the University has established a generally applicable
program to encourage the free exchange of ideas by its students,
an expressive marketplace that includes some 15 student publications
with predictably divergent viewpoints. It is equally clear that
petitioners' viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide
Awake is a religious activity, under both the University's regulation
and a fair reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide Awake,
according to petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality
by sending a message of hostility toward religion. To finance
Wide Awake, argues the University, violates the prohibition on
direct state funding of religious activities.
<P>
When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably neither
can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical platitudes
is unavailing. Resolution instead depends on the hard task of
judging--sifting through the details and determining whether *2526
the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause. Such
judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine,
based on the particular facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2661, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992)
(&quot;Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing&quot;).
As Justice Holmes observed in a different context: &quot;Neither
are we troubled by the question where to draw the line. That is
the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.
Day and night, youth and age are only types.&quot; Irwin v. Gavit,
268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925) (citation
omitted).
<P>
In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S.
481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), for example, we unanimously
held that the State may, through a generally applicable financial
aid program, pay a blind student's tuition at a sectarian theological
institution. The Court so held, however, only after emphasizing
that &quot;vocational assistance provided under the Washington
program is paid directly to the student, who transmits it to the
educational institution of his or her choice.&quot; Id., at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 751. The benefit to religion under the program,
therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her government
paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the conflict between
the neutrality principle and the funding prohibition, not by permitting
one to trump the other, but by relying on the elements of choice
peculiar to the facts of that case: &quot;The aid to religion
at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice. No
reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us
an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice
or belief.&quot; Id., at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 755 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See also Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, ----, 113 S.Ct.
2462, 2467-2468, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).
<P>
The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents itself
even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S.
1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest
exposition of the no-funding principle: &quot;No tax in any amount,
large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities
or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form
they may adopt to teach or practice religion.&quot; Id., at 16,
67 S.Ct., at 512. Yet the Court approved the use of public funds,
in a general program, to reimburse parents for their children's
bus fares to attend Catholic schools. Id., at 17-18, 67 S.Ct.,
at 512-513. Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's
disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at
19, 67 S.Ct., at 513 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (&quot;the most
fitting precedent is that of Julia who, according to Byron's reports,
'whispering &quot;I will ne'er consent,&quot;--consented' &quot;),
the decision reflected the need to rely on careful judgment--not
simple categories--when two principles, of equal historical and
jurisprudential pedigree, come into unavoidable conflict.
<P>
So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not admit
of categorical answers, nor should any be inferred from the Court's
decision today, see ante, at 2521. Instead, certain considerations
specific to the program at issue lead me to conclude that by providing
the same assistance to Wide Awake that it does to other publications,
the University would not be endorsing the magazine's religious
perspective.
<P>
First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence,
remain strictly independent of the University. The University's
agreement with the Contracted Independent Organizations (CIO)--i.e.,
student groups--provides:
<P>
&quot;The University is a Virginia public corporation and the
CIO is not part of that corporation, but rather exists and operates
independently of the University.... The parties understand and
agree that this Agreement is the only source of any control the
University may have over the CIO or its activities....&quot; App.
27.
<P>
And the agreement requires that student organizations include
in every letter, contract, publication, or other written materials
the following disclaimer:
<P>
*2527 &quot;Although this organization has members who are University
of Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the organization is
independent of the corporation which is the University and which
is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions.&quot;
Id., at 28.
<P>
Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publication's
independence from the University. Cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.,
at 274, n. 14, 102 S.Ct., at 276, n. 14.
<P>
Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that ensures
its use only for permissible purposes. A student organization
seeking assistance must submit disbursement requests; if approved,
the funds are paid directly to the third-party vendor and do not
pass through the organization's coffers. This safeguard accompanying
the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication
with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the
funds are used only to further the University's purpose in maintaining
a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from whatever perspective.
This feature also makes this case analogous to a school providing
equal access to a generally available printing press (or other
physical facilities), ante, at 2524, and unlike a block grant
to religious organizations.
<P>
Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in
a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement
of the religious message. Wide Awake does not exist in a vacuum.
It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for advertising
and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of these many
purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the University,
significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one
publication is perceived as endorsed by the University. Besides
the general news publications, for example, the University has
provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor magazine that
has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and Al-Salam,
a publication to &quot;promote a better understanding of Islam
to the University Community,&quot; App. 92. Given this wide array
of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints
in the forum supported by the University, any perception that
the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.
This is not the harder case where religious speech threatens to
dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, ante, --- U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 2451 (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
<P>
Mergens, 496 U.S., at 275, 110 S.Ct., at 2385.
<P>
Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note the
possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a Free Speech
Clause challenge by an objecting student that she should not be
compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees. See, e.g.,
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15, 110 S.Ct. 2228,
2236-2237, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,
431 U.S. 209, 236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).
There currently exists a split in the lower courts as to whether
such a challenge would be successful. Compare Hays County Guardian
v. Supple, 969 F.2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S.
----, 113 S.Ct. 1067, 122 L.Ed.2d 371 (1993); Kania v. Fordham,
702 F.2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students of Univ.
of Wash., 86 Wash.2d 94, 105-106, 542 P.2d 762, 769 (1975) (en
banc), with Smith v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal.4th 843,
863-864, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 194-195, 844 P.2d 500, 513-514, cert.
denied, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 181, 126 L.Ed.2d 140 (1993).
While the Court does not resolve the question here, see ante,
at 2522, the existence of such an opt-out possibility not available
to citizens generally, see Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13, 97 S.Ct.,
at 1811, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment), provides
a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the student fees
in this case from proceeds of the general assessments in support
of religion that lie at the core of the prohibition against religious
funding, see ante, at 2521-2522; post, at 2528-2529 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring); post, at 2535-2537 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and
from government funds generally. Unlike monies dispensed from
state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected
from students who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying
recipients only *2528 from among those who originally paid the
fee. The government neither pays into nor draws from this common
pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting individual
students proportional refunds. The Student Activities Fund, then,
represents not government resources, whether derived from tax
revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that simply
belongs to the students.
<P>
The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets the supremacy
of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of the funding
prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I observed
last Term, &quot;[e]xperience proves that the Establishment Clause,
like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single
test.&quot; Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2499
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
<P>
When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of categorical
obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified
Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified. The
Court today does only what courts must do in many Establishment
Clause cases--focus on specific features of a particular government
action to ensure that it does not violate the Constitution. By
withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides
generally to all other student publications, the University has
discriminated on the basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint
in violation of the Free Speech Clause. And particular features
of the University's program--such as the explicit disclaimer,
the disbursement of funds directly to third-party vendors, the
vigorous nature of the forum at issue, and the possibility for
objecting students to opt out--convince me that providing such
assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible
use of public funds to endorse Wide Awake's religious message.
<P>
Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Justice THOMAS, concurring.
<P>
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but I write
separately to express my disagreement with the historical analysis
put forward by the dissent. Although the dissent starts down the
right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment
Clause, its misleading application of history yields a principle
that is inconsistent with our Nation's long tradition of allowing
religious adherents to participate on equal terms in neutral government
programs.
<P>
Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called &quot;Assessment
Controversy&quot; was indicative of the principles embodied in
the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the dissent's
conclusion that government must actively discriminate against
religion. The dissent's historical discussion glosses over the
fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill that
sparked the controversy: The assessment was to be imposed for
the support of clergy in the performance of their function of
teaching religion. Thus, the &quot;Bill Establishing a Provision
for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; provided for the
collection of a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be
appropriated &quot;by the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each
religious society ... to a provision for a Minister or Teacher
of the Gospel of their denomination, or the providing places of
divine worship, and to none other use whatsoever.&quot; See Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 539, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). (FN1)
<P>
*2529 James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be understood
in this context. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, Madison's
objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the premise that
religious entities may never participate on equal terms in neutral
government programs. Nor did Madison embrace the argument that
forms the linchpin of the dissent: that monetary subsidies are
constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.
Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the neutrality
principle that the dissent inexplicably discards. According to
Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed because it &quot;violate[d]
that equality which ought to be the basis of every law.&quot;
Madison's Remonstrance p 4, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 66,
67 S.Ct., at 536 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). The assessment
violated the &quot;equality&quot; principle not because it allowed
religious groups to participate in a generally available government
program, but because the bill singled out religious entities for
special benefits. See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated
the equality principle &quot;by subjecting some to peculiar burdens&quot;
and &quot;by granting to others peculiar exemptions&quot;).
<P>
Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson
to take from the Assessment Controversy. For some, the experience
in Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the
Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental preferences
for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation
of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23
(1982); Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again:
<P>
A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds
and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L.Rev. 569, 590-591 (1984).
Other commentators have rejected this view, concluding that the
Establishment Clause forbids not only government preferences for
some religious sects over others, but also government preferences
for religion over irreligion. See, e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot;
Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp;
Mary L.Rev. 875, 875 (1986).
<P>
I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the
preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the
fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above. The funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion
of all other Sects.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance p 3, reprinted
in Everson, supra, at 65, 67 S.Ct., at 535-536.
<P>
In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remonstrance,
&quot;Madison's seventh, *2530 ninth, eleventh, and twelfth arguments
all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance, bigotry, unenlightenment,
and persecution that had generally resulted from previous exclusive
religious establishments.&quot; Cord, supra, at 21. The conclusion
that Madison saw the principle of nonestablishment as barring
governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems
especially clear in light of statements he made in the more-relevant
context of the House debates on the First Amendment. See Wallace
v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 98, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 2511, 86 L.Ed.2d
29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (Madison's views &quot;as
reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate]
that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the
establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination
among sects,&quot; but not &quot;as requiring neutrality on the
part of government between religion and irreligion&quot;). Moreover,
even if more extreme notions of the separation of church and state
can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from &quot;arguments
reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the
social contract between government and a civil society,&quot;
Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of nonestablishment
in the Constitution. In any event, the views of one man do not
establish the original understanding of the First Amendment.
<P>
But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this
case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the
history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that
the Establishment Clause &quot;categorically condemn[s] state
programs directly aiding religious activity&quot; when that aid
is part of a neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries.
Post, at 2539. Even if Madison believed that the principle of
nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial support
for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits specifically
targeting religion), there is no indication that at the time of
the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government
must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them
from more generally available financial subsidies. (FN2)
<P>
In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against
the dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary
Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison prepared
an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican Church.
This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and was
not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version
of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention to declare
that &quot;no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,]
to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges....&quot;
Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May 29-June
12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson &amp;
W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance
stressed that &quot;just government&quot; is &quot;best supported
by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with
the same equal hand which protects his person and his property;
by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering
any Sect to invade those of another.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance
p 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 537; cf.
Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49, 3 L.Ed. 650 (1815) (holding
that the Virginia constitution did not prevent the government
from &quot;aiding the votaries of every sect to ... perform their
own religious duties,&quot; or from &quot;establishing funds for
the support of ministers, for public charities, for the endowment
of churches, or for the sepulture of the dead&quot; *2531 Stripped
of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument is reduced
to the claim that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence permits
neutrality in the context of access to government facilities but
requires discrimination in access to government funds. The dissent
purports to locate the prohibition against &quot;direct public
funding&quot; at the &quot;heart&quot; of the Establishment Clause,
see post, at 2541, but this conclusion fails to confront historical
examples of funding that date back to the time of the founding.
To take but one famous example, both Houses of the First Congress
elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820
ed.); H.R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that
Congress enacted legislation providing for an annual salary of
$500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789,
ch. 17, Sec. 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a member of
the committee that recommended the chaplain system in the House.
See H.R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of Cong. 891 (1789);
<P>
Cord, supra, at 25. This same system of &quot;direct public funding&quot;
of congressional chaplains has &quot;continued without interruption
ever since that early session of Congress.&quot; Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U.S. 783, 788, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3334, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983).
(FN3)
<P>
The historical evidence of government support for religious entities
through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As the dissent
concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies &quot;have
been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests
represented by the Establishment Clause.&quot; Post, at 2542,
n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
676-680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415-1417, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). (FN4)
In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to
rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary aid
to religious groups even when the aid is equally available to
other groups. A tax exemption in many cases is economically and
functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.
(FN5) In *2532 one instance, the government relieves religious
entities (along with others) of a generally applicable tax; in
the other, it relieves religious entities (along with others)
of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning it in the
form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is provided at the
front or back end of the taxation process, the financial aid to
religious groups is undeniable. The analysis under the Establishment
Clause must also be the same: &quot;Few concepts are more deeply
embedded in the fabric of our national life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary
colonial times, than for the government to exercise at the very
least this kind of benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious
exercise....&quot; Walz, supra, at 676-677, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.
<P>
Consistent application of the dissent's &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
would require that &quot; 'a church could not be protected by
the police and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept
in repair.' &quot; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274-275, 102 S.Ct. 269,
277, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981)). The dissent admits that &quot;evenhandedness
may become important to ensuring that religious interests are
not inhibited.&quot; Post, at 2541, n. 5. Surely the dissent must
concede, however, that the same result should obtain whether the
government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing
the costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or
by establishing a public fire department. If churches may benefit
on equal terms with other groups in the latter program--that is,
if a public fire department may extinguish fires at churches--then
they may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.
<P>
Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray,
this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle
that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The
Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from
government benefits programs that are generally available to a
broad class of participants. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d
352 (1993); Zobrest, supra; Board of Ed. of Westside Community

Widmar, supra. Under the dissent's view, however, the University
of Virginia may provide neutral access to the University's own
printing press, but it may not provide the same service when the
press is owned by a third party. Not surprisingly, the dissent
offers no logical justification for this conclusion, and none
is evident in the text or original meaning of the First Amendment.
<P>
If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents
benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's
Student Activities Fund, it must also *2533 be offended when they
receive the same benefits in the form of in-kind subsidies. The
constitutional demands of the Establishment Clause may be judged
against either a baseline of &quot;neutrality&quot; or a baseline
of &quot;no aid to religion,&quot; but the appropriate baseline
surely cannot depend on the fortuitous circumstances surrounding
the form of aid. The contrary rule would lead to absurd results
that would jettison centuries of practice respecting the right
of religious adherents to participate on neutral terms in a wide
variety of government-funded programs.
<P>
Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to participate
in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to the class
of &quot;essential public benefits&quot; identified by the dissent.
See post, at 2541, n. 5. A broader tradition can be traced at
least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50.
Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress
had provided: &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge ... being
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools
and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.&quot; Id.,
at 52, n. (a). Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in
the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.
See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, Sec. 1, 2 Stat. 225-226;
Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, Sec. 5, 2 Stat. 279;
<P>
Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14, Sec. 10, 2 Stat. 621; Act of Apr.
18, 1818, ch. 67, Sec. 6, 3 Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch.
126, Sec. 2, 3 Stat. 467.
<P>
Many of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants
undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there
was no requirement that the schools be &quot;public.&quot; See
C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964). Nevertheless, early Congresses found
no problem with the provision of such neutral benefits. See also
id., at 174 (noting that &quot;almost universally[,] Americans
from 1789 to 1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion
and religiously oriented educational institutions&quot;).
<P>
Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been available
to religious adherents on neutral terms. Several examples may
be found in the work of early Congresses, including copyright
protection for &quot;the author and authors of any map, chart,
book or books,&quot; Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, Sec. 1, 1 Stat.
124, 124, and a privilege allowing &quot;every printer of newspapers
[to] send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers
within the United States, free of postage,&quot; Act of Feb. 20,
1792, ch. 7, Sec. 21, 1 Stat. 232, 238. Neither of these laws
made any exclusion for the numerous authors or printers who manifested
a belief in or about a deity.
<P>
Thus, history provides an answer for the constitutional question
posed by this case, but it is not the one given by the dissent.
The dissent identifies no evidence that the Framers intended to
disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms
in evenhanded government programs. The evidence that does exist
points in the opposite direction and provides ample support for
today's decision.
<P>
Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG and
Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
<P>
The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding of
core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does so,
however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar principles
of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment and Speech
Clauses, and by viewing the very funds in question as beyond the
reach of the Establishment Clause's funding restrictions as such.
Because there is no warrant for distinguishing among public funding
sources for purposes of applying the First Amendment's prohibition
of religious establishment, I would hold that the University's
refusal to support petitioners' religious activities is compelled
by the Establishment Clause. I would therefore affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
The central question in this case is whether a grant from the
Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses
*2534 would violate the Establishment Clause. Although the Court
does not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes
something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand
Establishment Clause scrutiny. Although the Court places great
stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious activities
for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that
such evenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy
constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in
a benefit to religion. Ante, at 2521; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Something more is necessary to justify
any religious aid. Some members of the Court, at least, may think
the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect, since the
money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide Awake's own
checking account. The Court's principal reliance, however, is
on an argument that providing religion with economically valuable
services is permissible on the theory that services are economically
indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech
forums, which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would
commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyond anything
justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums. The Court
implicitly recognizes this in its further attempt to circumvent
the clear bar to direct governmental aid to religion. Different
members of the Court seek to avoid this bar in different ways.
The opinion of the Court makes the novel assumption that only
direct aid financed with tax revenue is barred, and draws the
erroneous conclusion that the involuntary Student Activities Fee
is not a tax. I do not read Justice O'CONNOR'S opinion as sharing
that assumption; she places this Student Activities Fund in a
category of student funding enterprises from which religious activities
in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no consequent
endorsement of religion. The resulting decision is in unmistakable
tension with the accepted law that the Court continues to avow.

<P>
The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a closer
look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords. The character
of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the opening page of the
first issue, where the editor-in-chief announces Wide Awake's
mission in a letter to the readership signed, &quot;Love in Christ&quot;:
it is &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed,
according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot;
App. 45. The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation,
that &quot;[t]he hour has come for you to awake from your slumber,
because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11.&quot;
<P>
Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on
the editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call to accept salvation:
<P>
&quot;The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and
repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware
of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and
condemn sin, or else they fail in their duty of love.&quot; Mourad
&amp; Prince, A Love/Hate Relationship, November/December 1990,
p. 3.

&quot;When you get to the final gate, the Lord will be handing

lifetime, you did not request a seat on His Friendly Skies Flyer
by trusting Him and asking Him to be your pilot, then you will
not be on His list of reserved seats (and the Lord will know you
not). You will not be able to buy a ticket then; no amount of
money or desire will do the trick. You will be met by your chosen
pilot and flown straight to Hell on an express jet (without air
conditioning or toilets, of course).&quot; Ace, The Plane Truth,

<P>
There is no need to quote further from articles of like tenor,
but one could examine such other examples as religious poetry,
see Macpherson, I Have Started Searching for Angels, November/December
1990, p. 18; religious textual analysis and commentary, see Buterbaugh,
Colossians 1:1-14: Abundant Life, id., at 20; Buterbaugh, John

on religious practice, see Early, Thanksgiving and Prayer, November/December
1990, p. 21 (providing readers with suggested prayers and posing
contemplative questions about biblical texts); Early, Hope and
Spirit, March/April 1991, p. 21 (similar).
<P>
Even featured essays on facially secular topics become platforms
from which to call readers to fulfill the tenets of Christianity
in their lives. Although a piece on racism has some general discussion
on the subject, it proceeds beyond even the analysis and interpretation
of biblical texts to conclude with the counsel to take action
because that is the Christian thing to do:
<P>
&quot;God calls us to take the risks of voluntarily stepping out
of our comfort zones and to take joy in the whole richness of
our inheritance in the body of Christ. We must take the love we
receive from God and share it with all peoples of the world.
<P>
&quot;Racism is a disease of the heart, soul, and mind, and only
when it is extirpated from the individual consciousness and replaced
with the love and peace of God will true personal and communal
healing begin.&quot; Liu, et al., &quot;Eracing&quot; Mistakes,
November/December 1990, p. 14.
<P>
The same progression occurs in an article on eating disorders,
which begins with descriptions of anorexia and bulimia and ends
with this religious message:
<P>
&quot;As thinking people who profess a belief in God, we must
grasp firmly the truth, the reality of who we are because of Christ.
Christ is the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Through Him, we are full.
He alone can provide the ultimate source of spiritual fulfillment
which permeates the emotional, psychological, and physical dimensions
of our lives.&quot; Ferguson &amp; Lassiter, From Calorie to Calvary,

<P>
This writing is no merely descriptive examination of religious
doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's
social and personal problems. Nor is it merely the expression
of editorial opinion that incidentally coincides with Christian
ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is
straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with
God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral
obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These
are not the words of &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] ...&quot; (in the language
of the University's funding criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a), but the words of &quot;challenge [to] Christians to live,
in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ...
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means&quot;
(in the language of Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject
is not the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room,
but of the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is
nothing other than the preaching of the word, which (along with
the sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer those
called to the religious life.
<P>
Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the
word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause,
and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was
meant to bar this use of public money. Evidence on the subject
antedates even the Bill of Rights itself, as may be seen in the
writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the meaning
of the Establishment Clause is well settled, e.g., Committee for
Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 770,
n. 28, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2964, n. 28, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973); Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 13, 67 S.Ct. 504, 510, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Four years before the First Congress proposed
the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy
of using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial
*2536 and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played
the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment
bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses
stand:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that ... the same authority which can force
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the
support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to
any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?&quot; James Madison,
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments p 3 (hereinafter
Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson, supra, at 65-66
[67 S.Ct., at 524] (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).
<P>
Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony
had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n.
8, 67 S.Ct., at 509, n. 8, the practice having become &quot;so
commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling
of abhorrence,&quot; 330 U.S., at 11, 67 S.Ct., at 509 (footnote
omitted). Madison's Remonstrance captured the colonists' &quot;conviction
that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under
a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support,
or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with
the beliefs of any religious individual or group.&quot; Ibid.
(FN1) Their sentiment as expressed by Madison in Virginia, led
not only *2537 to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill,
but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. That bill's preamble
declared that &quot;to compel a man to furnish contributions of
money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is
sinful and tyrannical,&quot; Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84-85
(P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its text provided
&quot;[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support
any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever....,&quot;
ibid. See generally Everson, supra, at 13, 67 S.Ct., at 510. We
have &quot;previously recognized that the provisions of the First
Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson
played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended
to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion
on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.&quot;
<P>
Ibid.; see also Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion:
A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev.
875, 921, 923 (1986) (&quot;[I]f the debates of the 1780's support
any proposition, it is that the Framers opposed government financial
support for religion.... They did not substitute small taxes for
large taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum. The principle
was what mattered. With respect to money, religion was to be wholly
voluntary. Churches either would support themselves or they would
not, but the government would neither help nor interfere&quot;)
(footnote omitted); T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At
the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;);
J. Choper, Securing Religious Liberty 16 (1995) (&quot;There is
broad consensus that a central threat to the religious freedom
of individuals and groups--indeed, in the judgment of many the
most serious infringement upon religious liberty--is posed by
forcing them to pay taxes in support of a religious establishment
or religious activities&quot;) (footnotes omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted). (FN2)
<P>
*2538 The principle against direct funding with public money is
patently violated by the contested use of today's student activity
fee. (FN3) Like today's taxes generally, the fee is Madison's
threepence. The University exercises the power of the State to
compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble, supra, and
the use of any part of it for the direct support of religious
activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly held to be the
heart of the prohibition on establishment. Everson, 330 U.S.,
at 15-16, 67 S.Ct., at 511 (&quot;The 'establishment of religion
clause' ... means at least this.... No tax in any amount, large
or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they
may adopt to teach or practice religion&quot;); see School Dist.
of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 385, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3223,
87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985) (&quot;Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence
is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely
prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith&quot;); Committee

2968 (&quot;In the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing

for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, it is clear
from our cases that direct aid in whatever form is invalid&quot;);
id., at 772, 93 S.Ct., at 2969 (&quot;Primary among those evils&quot;
against which the Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been

sovereign in religious activity&quot;) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
640, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting) (&quot;The coercion that was a hallmark of historical
establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy
and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty&quot;)
(emphasis omitted); cf. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 103-104,
88 S.Ct. 1942, 1954-1955, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968) (holding that
taxpayers have an adequate stake in the outcome of Establishment
Clause litigation to satisfy Article III standing requirements,
after *2539 stating that &quot;[o]ur history vividly illustrates
that one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the
Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the
taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion
over another or to support religion in general&quot;).
<P>
The Court, accordingly, has never before upheld direct state funding
of the sort of proselytizing published in Wide Awake and, in fact,
has categorically condemned state programs directly aiding religious
activity, School Dist. v. Ball, supra, at 395, 105 S.Ct., at 3228-3229
(striking programs providing secular instruction to nonpublic
school students on nonpublic school premises because they are
&quot;indistinguishable from the provision of a direct cash subsidy
to the religious school that is most clearly prohibited under
the Establishment Clause&quot;); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229,
254, 97 S.Ct. 2593, 2608-2609, 53 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (striking

Black, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in

<P>
Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing
both secular and sectarian functions, it has always made a searching
enquiry to ensure that the institution kept the secular activities
separate from its sectarian ones, with any direct aid flowing
only to the former and never the latter. Bowen v. Kendrick, 487

1926-1929, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) (upholding textbook loan program
limited to secular books requested by individual students for
secular educational purposes).
<P>
Reasonable minds may differ over whether the Court reached the
correct result in each of these cases, but their common principle
has never been questioned or repudiated. &quot;Although Establishment
Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause
does absolutely prohibit government-financed ... indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith.&quot; School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223.
<P>
B
<P>
Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts
and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear
constitutional *2540 violation? The answer must be in part that
the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding
section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively
to Wide Awake's &quot;Christian viewpoint,&quot; ante, at 2515,
or its &quot;religious perspective,&quot; ante, at 2518, and in
distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church,
the Court maintains that &quot;[Wide Awake] is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense,&quot; ante, at 2524;
(FN4) see also ante, at 2515. The Court does not quote the magazine's
adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness
of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept
Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual
analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so it is easy for the
Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court
of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly
evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions
to religious points of view.
<P>
Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide
Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently religious
about the magazine to require examination under the Establishment
Clause, and one may therefore ask why the unequivocal prohibition
on direct funding does not lead the Court to conclude that funding
would be unconstitutional. The answer is that the Court focuses
on a subsidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately
misapplies. That subsidiary body of law accounts for the Court's
substantial attention to the fact that the University's funding
scheme is &quot;neutral,&quot; in the formal sense that it makes
funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and sectarian
applicants alike. Ante, at 2521-2522. While this is indeed true
and relevant under our cases, it does not alone satisfy the requirements
of the Establishment Clause, as the Court recognizes when it says
that evenhandedness is only a &quot;significant factor&quot; in
certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a dispositive one.
Ante, at 2521; see ante, at 2521-2522; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id., at 2525 (&quot;Neutrality, in
both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause&quot;);
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, --- U.S.
----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (&quot;the
Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the application
of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously oblivious
to the effects of its actions.... [N]ot all State policies are
permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are
neutral in form&quot;). This recognition reflects the Court's
appreciation of two general rules: that whenever affirmative government
aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires
some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part;
and that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even
if accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at
the very heart of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 2523 (&quot;We
do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that
includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct
money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious
activity&quot;); ante, at 2522, 2523-2524; see also ante, at ----
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;[Our] decisions ... provide
no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious
activities&quot;).
<P>
In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules
but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those
rules in greater detail than the Court does. As the foregoing
quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship
between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of evenhandedness
when affirmative government aid does result in some benefit to
religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal
criterion. *2541 At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands
the prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition
does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of the
Clause's application. Is any government activity that provides
any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional?
Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning churches, wrong
to pay the bus fares of students on the way to parochial schools,
wrong to allow a grantee of special education funds to spend them
at a religious college? These are the questions that call for
drawing lines, and it is in drawing them that evenhandedness becomes
important. However the Court may in the past have phrased its
line-drawing test, the question whether such benefits are provided
on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addresses
one aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with respect
to religion (that is, whether the law either &quot;advance[s]
[or] inhibit[s] religion,&quot; Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592, 109
S.Ct. 3086, 3100, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)). In Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981),
for example, we noted that &quot;[t]he provision of benefits to
[a] broad ... spectrum of [religious and nonreligious] groups
is an important index of secular effect.&quot; See also Board
of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S.
----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).
In the doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding),
where there is initially room for argument about a law's effect,
evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly
advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Evenhandedness
is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into the constitutionality
of a doubtful law, (FN5) but evenhandedness goes no further. It
does not guarantee success under Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen,
463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct.
748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993),
are among the latest of those to illustrate this relevance of
evenhandedness when advancement is not so obvious as to be patently
unconstitutional. Each case involved a program in which benefits
given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately were
used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious
institutions. (FN6)
<P>
In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a
neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program
at issue. Witters, supra, at 487-488, 106 S.Ct., at 751; Mueller,
supra, at 397-399, 103 S.Ct. at 3068-3069; Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2468. But the significance of
evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases,
hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.
Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might
be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.
Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was
the fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious institutions
&quot;only as a result of the genuinely independent and private
choices of aid recipients,&quot; Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct.,
at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;
Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469. In noting
and relying on this particular feature of each of the programs
at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct
funding of religious activities. *2542 See Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469; Witters, supra, at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070. Thus, our holdings in these cases were little more
than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that &quot;a State
may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate
all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without
constitutional barrier....&quot; Witters, supra, at 486-487, 106
S.Ct., at 751. Such &quot;attenuated financial benefit[s], ultimately
controlled by the private choices of individual[s],&quot; we have
found, are simply not within the contemplation of the Establishment
Clause's broad prohibition. Mueller, supra, at 400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070; see also Witters, supra, at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755
(opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). (FN7)
<P>
Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit
is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient condition
of constitutionality for direct financial support of religious
proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated
any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere
prohibition against unequal direct aid. See, e.g., Tilton v. Richardson,
403 U.S., at 682-684, 91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (striking portion
of general aid program providing grants for construction of college
and university facilities to the extent program made possible
the use of funds for sectarian activities); (FN8) Wolman v. Walter,
433 U.S., at 252-255, 97 S.Ct., at 2608-09 (striking funding of
field trips for nonpublic school students, such as are &quot;provided
to public *2543 school students in the district,&quot; because
of unacceptable danger that state funds would be used to foster
religion). And nowhere has the Court's adherence to the preeminence
of the no-direct-funding principle over the principle of evenhandedness
been as clear as in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520.
<P>
Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act
(AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions
for counseling and educational services related to adolescent
sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the litigation, 141 grants
had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular
and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597, 108 S.Ct.,
at 2567-2568. In an Establishment Clause challenge to the Act
brought by taxpayers and other interested parties, the District
Court resolved the case on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment,
holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and
also insofar as religious institutions were involved in receiving
grants under the Act. When this Court reversed on the issue of
facial constitutionality under the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 602-618, 108 S.Ct., at 2570-2579, we said that there was &quot;no
intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees,
religious uses are permitted.&quot; Id., at 614, 108 S.Ct., at
2577. On the contrary, after looking at the legislative history
and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure
that grants would not be &quot;used by ... grantees in such a
way as to advance religion.&quot; Id., at 615, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.
<P>
With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional
as applied, we remanded the case to the District Court &quot;for
consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as
it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently
being administered.&quot; Id., at 621, 108 S.Ct., at 2580.
<P>
Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to &quot;consider
... whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund
'specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially
secular setting.' &quot; Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S.,
at 743, 93 S.Ct., at 2874. In giving additional guidance to the
District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would
be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were
using materials &quot;that have an explicitly religious content
or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious
faith.&quot; Ibid. At no point in our opinion did we suggest that
the breadth of potential recipients, or distribution on an evenhanded
basis, could have justified the use of federal funds for religious
activities, a position that would have made no sense after we
had pegged the Act's facial constitutionality to our conclusion
that advancement of religion was not inevitable. Justice O'CONNOR's
separate opinion in the case underscored just this point: &quot;I
fully agree ... that '[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse
the religious message.' Post, at 642, 108 S.Ct., at 2591-2592
[ (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ].... [A]ny use of public funds to
promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause.&quot;
Id., at 622-623, 108 S.Ct., at 2581-582 (concurring opinion) (emphasis
in original).
<P>
Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Everson v. Board
of Ed., 330 U.S., at 16-18, 67 S.Ct., at 511-513, Board of Ed.
v. Allen, 392 U.S., at 243-249, 88 S.Ct., at 1926-1930, Tilton
v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 678-682, 91 S.Ct., at 2095-2098, Hunt
v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 742-745, 93 S.Ct., at 2873-2875, and Roemer
v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S., at 759-761, 96 S.Ct.,
at 2351-2352. Each of these cases involved a general aid program
that provided benefits to a broad array of secular and sectarian
institutions on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them was that
fact dispositive. The plurality opinion in Roemer made this point
exactly:
<P>
&quot;The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and
a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is
lending direct support to a religious activity. The State may
not, for example, pay for what is actually a religious education,
even though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even
though it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions
alike.&quot; 426 U.S., at 747, 96 S.Ct., at 2345 (opinion of Blackmun,
J.).
<P>
Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aid cases,
as in Bowen, was whether *2544 secular activities could be separated
from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that aid would
flow to the secular alone.
<P>
Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve the standard
thus exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished
the indirect aid in issue from contrasting examples in the line
of cases striking down direct aid, and each thereby expressly
preserved the core constitutional principle that direct aid to
religion is impermissible. See Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger, 421
U.S. 349, 95 S.Ct. 1753, 44 L.Ed.2d 217 and School Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 87 L.Ed.2d 267, and noting that
&quot; '[t]he state may not grant aid to a religious school, whether
cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct
subsidy to the religious school' &quot;) (quoting Witters, 474
U.S., at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751); see also ibid.; Mueller, 463
U.S., at 399, 103 S.Ct., at 3069. It appears that the University
perfectly understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule
over the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short
of funding &quot;any activity which primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;
(FN9) App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
<P>
C
<P>
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of evenhandedness
is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the constitutionality
of providing a government benefit that reaches religion, the Court
must identify some further element in the funding scheme that
does demonstrate its permissibility. For one reason or another,
the Court's chosen element appears to be the fact that under the
University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen
by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
1
<P>
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding
program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and
Zobrest (discussed supra, at 2521-2522), the Court has misread
those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit
religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between
the government and a religious institution. See Witters, 474 U.S.,
at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751; see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400,
103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070; Zobrest, *2545 509 U.S., at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2467-2469. Here there is no third party standing
between the government and the ultimate religious beneficiary
to break the circuit by its independent discretion to put state
money to religious use. The printer, of course, has no option
to take the money and use it to print a secular journal instead
of Wide Awake. It only gets the money because of its contract
to print a message of religious evangelism at the direction of
Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for doing precisely
that. The formalism of distinguishing between payment to Wide
Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment of the approved
bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of Constitutional
law. If this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution
would permit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution;
(FN10) in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence to the
no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand out credit
cards to religious institutions and honor the monthly statements
(so long as someone could devise an evenhanded umbrella to cover
the whole scheme). Witters and the other cases cannot be distinguished
out of existence this way.
<P>
2
<P>
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the
printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On
this purported justification, the payment to the printer is significant
only as the last step in an argument resting on the assumption
that a public university may give a religious group the use of
any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular groups are
likewise eligible. The Court starts with the cases of Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Board
of Ed. of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,
110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), in which religious groups were held to
be entitled to access for speaking in government buildings open
generally for that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability
of a forum has economic value (the government built and maintained
the building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall); and
that economically there is no difference between the University's
provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the
University's printing equipment; and that therefore the University
must be able to provide the use of the latter. Since it may do
that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw
the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what
the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's
own printing equipment. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its
troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon
to support it. The common factual thread running through Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution
created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or
college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude speakers
with religious messages. See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-955,
74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (forum analysis). In each case the restriction
was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate
the content of speech in an open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens)
or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's
Chapel, see infra, at 2550-2551). In each case, to be sure, the
religious speaker's use of the room passed muster as an incident
of a plan to facilitate speech generally for a secular purpose,
entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk
that the religious speech would be taken to be the speech *2546
of the government or that the government's endorsement of a religious
message would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable
Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation
Army, the millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker
in a public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the
model of the street corner that supplied the justification going
beyond the requirement of evenhandedness.
<P>
The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is
ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While they do indeed
allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on the
recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street corner
(even though the State paves the roads and provides police protection
to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between the public
street corner and open classroom space. Thus, the Court found
it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in traditional
speech activities in these forums, too, even though the rooms
(like street corners) require some incidental state spending to
maintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the
cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote them, to cover
more than forums for literal speaking. There is no traditional
street corner printing provided by the government on equal terms
to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to a higher
plane of generalization without admitting that new economic benefits
are being extended directly to religion in clear violation of
the principle barring direct aid. The argument from economic equivalence
thus breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it would
support is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the service
of free speech. Absent that, the rule against direct aid stands
as a bar to printing services as well as printers.
<P>
3
<P>
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads
the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third
attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law,
but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways
that make further affirmative justification unnecessary. Justice
O'CONNOR makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which
the activity fee is assessed and distributed. She concludes that
the funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of governmental
treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's
purview in the absence of a message of religious endorsement (which
she finds not to be present). Ante, at 2526-2528 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring). The opinion of the Court concludes more expansively
that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find
the aid permissible on the legal assumption that the bar against
direct aid applies only to aid derived from tax revenue. I have
already indicated why it is fanciful to treat the fee as anything
but a tax, supra, at 2538, and n. 3; see also ante, at 2522 (noting
mandatory nature of the fee), and will not repeat the point again.
The novelty of the assumption that the direct aid bar only extends
to aid derived from taxation, however, requires some response.
<P>
Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write
in the first instance, the Court has never held that government
resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct religious
support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently
spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues. E.g., School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223 (&quot;Although
Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes,
the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored
indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith&quot;);
Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780, 93 S.Ct., at 2969 (&quot;In the absence
of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived
from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,
and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct
aid in whatever form is invalid&quot;); id., at 772, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2965 (&quot;Primary among those evils&quot; against which the
Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity&quot;) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time
*2547 of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;).
<P>
Allowing non-tax funds to be spent on religion would, in fact,
fly in the face of clear principle. Leaving entirely aside the
question whether public non-tax revenues could ever be used to
finance religion without violating the endorsement test, see Allegheny
County v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at 593-594,
109 S.Ct., at 3100-3101, any such use of them would ignore one
the dual objectives of the Establishment Clause, which was meant
not only to protect individuals and their republics from the destructive
consequences of mixing government and religion, but to protect
religion from a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d
601 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's &quot;first and most immediate
purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion&quot;); Everson,
330 U.S., at 53, 67 S.Ct., at 529-530 (Rutledge, J., dissenting)
(&quot;The great condition of religious liberty is that it be
maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences,
by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation
it vanishes with the resting&quot;) (citing Madison's Remonstrance
pp 7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63-72, 67 S.Ct., at 534-539
(appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)); School Dist. of Abington
v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 259, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1591, 10 L.Ed.2d
844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (&quot;It is not only the
nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and
controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it
is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed
which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the
government&quot;) (footnote omitted); Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution,
at 84-85. Since the corrupting effect of government support does
not turn on whether the Government's own money comes from taxation
or gift or the sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause
could hardly relax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was
not implicated. Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal,
one can only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate
one half of the Establishment Clause's justification.
<P>
D
<P>
Nothing in the Court's opinion would lead me to end this enquiry
into the application of the Establishment Clause any differently
from the way I began it. The Court is ordering an instrumentality
of the State to support religious evangelism with direct funding.
This is a flat violation of the Establishment Clause.
<P>
II
<P>
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause's bar
to funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether
in the absence of this bar the University would violate the Free
Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has done. Widmar, 454
U.S., at 271, 102 S.Ct., at 275 (university's compliance with
its Establishment Clause obligations can be a compelling interest
justifying speech restriction). But the Court's speech analysis
may have independent application, and its flaws should not pass
unremarked.
<P>
The Court acknowledges, ante, at 2518, the necessity for a university
to make judgments based on the content of what may be said or
taught when it decides, in the absence of unlimited amounts of
money or other resources, how to honor its educational responsibilities.
Widmar, supra, at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277-278; cf. Perry, 460 U.S.,
at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957 (subject matter and speaker identity
distinctions &quot;are inherent and inescapable in the process
of limiting a non-public forum to activities compatible with the
intended purpose of the property&quot;). Nor does the Court generally
question that in allocating public funds a state university enjoys
spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 1773, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991)
<P>
(&quot;[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to establish
a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program&quot;);
Regan v. Taxation *2548 with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S.
540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983) (upholding government
subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker). (FN11)
Accordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry in
this case is not merely whether the University bases its funding
decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if there is
an infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision,
it must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing
among competing viewpoints, ante, at 2516-2517, citing, inter
alia, Perry, supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 957; see also Lamb's
Chapel, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2144-2145 (subject matter
distinctions permissible in controlling access to limited public
forum if reasonable and viewpoint neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct.
3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (similar); Regan, supra, at
548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002. (FN12)
<P>
The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not
turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied
to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the
issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is explained
by reference to viewpoint. See Cornelius, supra, at 806, 105 S.Ct.,
at 3439 (&quot;[T]he government violates the First Amendment when
it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of
view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject&quot;). As
when deciding whether a speech restriction is content-based or
content-neutral, &quot;[t]he government's purpose is the controlling
consideration.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,
791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); see also ibid.
(content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech restriction
is &quot;justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive noise ordinance
by pulling the plug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification
system is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because
the band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist views.
Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra. Nor does a municipality's
decision to prohibit political advertising on bus placards amount
to viewpoint discrimination when in the course of applying this
policy it denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor
of a particular political candidate. Accord, Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 2717-2718, 41 L.Ed.2d
770 (1974) (plurality opinion).
<P>
Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves
that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to
bar the government from skewing public debate. Other things being
equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows
one message while prohibiting the messages of *2549 those who
can reasonably be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-1421,
55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (&quot;Especially where ... the legislature's
suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of
a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views
to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended&quot;)
(footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176, 97 S.Ct. 421,
426, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976) (&quot;to permit one side of a debatable
public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views ...
is the antithesis of constitutional guarantees&quot;) (footnote
omitted); United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 736, 110 S.Ct.
3115, 3124, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (viewpoint discrimination involves
an &quot;inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another&quot;)
(plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate
that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most
pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if government
assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires
it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.
<P>
There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's application
of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under those Guidelines,
a &quot;religious activit[y],&quot; which is not eligible for
funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
It is clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions
was denied funding.
<P>
Letter from Student Council to Ronald W. Rosenberger. App. 54
(&quot;In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the
Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request
could not be funded as it is a religious activity&quot;). The
discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at 2534-2536, shows
beyond any question that it &quot;primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity ...,&quot; in the very
specific sense that its manifest function is to call students
to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular
moral action because of its Christian character. 
<P>
If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only
such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that
might compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.
But that is not what the regulation authorizes; it applies to
Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.
And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting
a particular belief not only &quot;in&quot; but &quot;about&quot;
a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists
as well as it does to deists and theists (as the University maintained
at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes,
see ante, at 2520). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide
Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not
its competitors. As understood by their application to Wide Awake,
they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests&quot; any view on the merits of religion;
they deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious apologetics.
<P>
The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while
I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the
important point is that even on the Court's own construction the
Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to
demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding restrictions
might have on learning in our nation's universities, the Court
describes the Guidelines as &quot;a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry,&quot; disentitling a vast array of
topics to funding. Ante, at 2520. As the Court reads the Guidelines
to exclude &quot;any writing that is explicable as resting upon
a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate
reality,&quot; as well as &quot;those student journalistic efforts
which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no
deity and no ultimate reality,&quot; the Court concludes that
the major works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred
from the funding forum. Ante, at 2520. The Court goes so far as
to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate
nothing much more *2550 than essays on &quot;making pasta or peanut
butter cookies....&quot; Ante, at 2520.
<P>
Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court
protests. The Court reads the word &quot;primarily&quot; (&quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality&quot;) right out of the Guidelines, whereas
it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve, or simply
descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a
given religion. But, as I said, that is not the important point.
Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restriction's
categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction would most
certainly not work any impermissible viewpoint discrimination
under any prior understanding of that species of content discrimination.
If a University wished to fund no speech beyond the subjects of
pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating
on the basis of someone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial
claim that pasta and cookies did not exist. The upshot would be
an instructional universe without higher education, but not a
universe where one viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.
<P>
The Guidelines are thus substantially different from the access
restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case upon which the
Court heavily relies in finding a viewpoint distinction here,
ante, at 2517-2518. Lamb's Chapel addressed a school board's regulation
prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises &quot;by any
group for religious purposes,&quot; even though the forum otherwise
was open for a variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes.
508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
<P>
&quot;Religious&quot; was understood to refer to the viewpoint
of a believer, and the regulation did not purport to deny access
to any speaker wishing to express a non-religious or expressly
antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid. (&quot;The
issue in this case is whether ... it violates the Free Speech
Clause of the First Amendment ... to deny a church access to school
premises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious
purposes, a film dealing with family and child-rearing issues&quot;);
id., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144, citing May v. Evansville-Vanderburgh
School Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1114 (CA7 1986). (FN13)
<P>
With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel
we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied
to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian
perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the
basis of viewpoint. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (considering as-applied challenge only).
Equally obvious is the distinction between that case and this
one, where the regulation is being applied, not to deny funding
for those who discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint,
but to those engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion
and religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint
discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between
viewpoint and content.
<P>
*2551. To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating
a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate
with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded
that primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together,
always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint
to any speech about any secular topic. Thus, the Court's reasoning
requires a university that funds private publications about any
primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily
espousing adherence to or rejection of religion. But a university's
decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fund publications
aimed at urging repentance before God does not skew the debate
either about racism or the desirability of religious conversion.
The Court's contrary holding amounts to a significant reformulation
of our viewpoint discrimination precedents and will significantly
expand access to limited-access forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424
U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976) (upholding regulation
prohibiting political speeches on military base); Cornelius, 473
U.S., at 812, 105 S.Ct., at 3454 (exclusion from fundraising drive
of political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint
neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health and welfare agencies);
Perry, 460 U.S., at 49-50, and n. 9, 103 S.Ct., at 957-958, and
n. 9 (ability of teachers' bargaining representative to use internal
school mail system does not require that access be provided to
&quot;any other citizen's group or community organization with
a message for school personnel&quot;); Lehman, 418 U.S., at 304,
94 S.Ct., at 2718 (exclusion of political messages from forum
permissible despite ability of nonpolitical speakers to use the
forum) (plurality opinion).

<P>
Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today's decision
portends much more than making a shambles out of student activity
fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehension is whetted by
Chief Justice Burger's warning in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 624, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2116, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971): &quot;in
constitutional adjudication some steps, which when taken were
thought to approach 'the verge,' have become the platform for
yet further steps. A certain momentum develops in constitutional
theory and it can be a 'downhill thrust' easily set in motion
but difficult to retard or stop.&quot;
<P>
I respectfully dissent. FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of
the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter
of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States
v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50
L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have
created a &quot;generally available subsidy program&quot; comparable
to respondent's Student Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 2536,
n. 1. The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is
squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide
&quot;for the support of Christian teachers.&quot;
<P>
Everson, 330 U.S., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539. Moreover, the section
of the bill cited by the dissent, see post, at 2536-2537, n. 1,
simply indicated that funds would be &quot;disposed of under the
direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries
of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,&quot;
Everson, supra, at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540. This provision disposing
of undesignated funds hardly transformed the &quot;Bill Establishing
a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; into
a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents
as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference
to religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the
bill would have been to promote &quot;the general diffusion of
Christian knowledge,&quot; id., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539; any possible
appropriation for &quot;seminaries of learning&quot; depended
entirely on future legislative action.
<P>
Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's
directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing
in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian
educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the
time of the founding were affiliated with some religious organization,
see C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was no system of
public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings of Public Education
in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917); see also A. Johnson, The
Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States
4 (1982) (&quot;In Virginia the parish institutions transported
from England were the earliest educational agencies. Although
much of the teaching took place in the home and with the aid of
tutors, every minister had a school, and it was the duty of the
vestry to see that all the poor children were taught to read and
write&quot;) (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious
tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation
of residual funds to sectarian &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot;
Finally, although modern historians have focused on the opt-out
provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed
the Virginia assessment as an evenhanded program; in fact, several
of the objections expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance
Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at
63, 67 S.Ct., at 534-535, focus clearly on the bill's violation
of the principle of &quot;equality,&quot; or evenhandedness. See
infra, at 2529-2530.
<P>
FN2. To the contrary, Madison's Remonstrance decried the fact
that the assessment bill would require civil society to take &quot;cognizance&quot;
of religion. Madison's Remonstrance p 1, reprinted in Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 64, 67 S.Ct. 504, 535, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Respondent's exclusion of religious activities
from SAF funding creates this very problem.
<P>
It requires University officials to classify publications as &quot;religious
activities,&quot; and to discriminate against the publications
that fall into that category. Such a policy also contravenes the
principles expressed in Madison'sRemonstrance by encouraging religious
adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus
&quot;degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose
opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.&quot;
Id. p 9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69, 67 S.Ct., at 537.
*2551_ 
<P>
FN3. A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount
to direct funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e.g.
Act of Feb. 20, 1833, ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the
State of Ohio to sell &quot;all or any part of the lands heretofore
reserved and appropriated by Congress for the support of religion
within the Ohio Company's ... purchases ... and to invest the
money arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund;
the proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied ... for
the support of religion within the several townships for which
said lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no
other use or purpose whatsoever&quot;); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch.
86, Secs. 1, 3, 6 Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College--a
Jesuit institution--&quot;lots in the city of Washington, to the
amount, in value, of twenty-five thousand dollars,&quot; and directing
the College to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter
using the dividends to establish and endow such professorships
as it saw fit); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 103,
105 S.Ct. 2479, 2514, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting)
(&quot;As the United States moved from the 18th into the 19th
century, Congress appropriated time and again public moneys in
support of sectarian Indian education carried on by religious
organizations&quot;).
<P>
FN4. The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment
Controversy
<P>
itself is inconsistent with the rigid &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
embraced by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the Virginia legislature
authorized tax exemptions for property belonging to the &quot;commonwealth,
or to any county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or
seminary of learning.&quot; Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, Sec.
1, 1800 Va.Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson, respondent's founder
and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the
use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology in
conjunction with other professional schools. See S. Padover, The
Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see also id., at 958 (noting that
Jefferson advocated giving &quot;to the sectarian schools of divinity
the full benefit [of] the public provisions made for instruction
in the other branches of science&quot;).
<P>
FN5. In the tax literature, this identity is called a &quot;tax
expenditure,&quot; a concept &quot;based upon recognition of the
fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person
or group by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or
exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms.
For example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to
add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax
rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government can
send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his
income, or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by
$23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct
payment were itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket,
the preacher would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction
as he would from the direct payment.&quot; Wolfman, Tax Expenditures:
From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985). In
fact, Congress has provided a similar &quot;tax expenditure&quot;
in Sec. 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a &quot;
'minister of the gospel' &quot; an unlimited exclusion for the
rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the
rental allowance paid to him. See id., at 492, n. 6.
<P>
Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the
tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 20,
n. 7, is misplaced in this context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue
Code, The Constitution, and the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure
Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 855,
862, n. 30 (1993):
<P>
&quot;Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on
the difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is
not a special provision. Professor Boris Bittker, for example,
argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any
tax could not be described as the equivalent of subsidies. Boris
I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis
was short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large
body of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept
that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The current
debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly identified
as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions are more
efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than direct
spending programs. See generally [numerous authorities].&quot;
*2551_ FN1. Justice THOMAS suggests that Madison would have approved
of the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle
of evenhandedness. Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison
advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial
support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy
program. Indeed, while Justice THOMAS claims that the &quot;funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects,&quot; ante, at 2529, it is clear that the bill
was more general in scope than this. While the bill, which is
reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74,
67 S.Ct. 504, 538-540, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided that each
taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted
his levy paid, id., at 73, 67 S.Ct., at 539, it would also have
allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any religious
society, in which case the legislature was to use these unappropriated
sums to fund &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot; Id., at 74, 67
S.Ct., at 540 (contrary to Justice THOMAS's unsupported assertion,
this portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other).
While some of these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious
in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally
understood at the time to be &quot;any school, academy, college
or university, in which young persons are instructed in the several
branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments.&quot;
N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st
ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary 956 (2d ed.1989).
Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally agreed that the
bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools. See,
e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 875,
897 (1986) (&quot;Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church,
with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools ...
The bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost
certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the
training of ministers&quot;); T. Buckley, Church and State in
Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) (&quot;The assessment
had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support
education rather than religion to do so&quot;); T. Curry, The
First Freedoms 141 (1986) (&quot;[T]hose taxes not designated
for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education&quot;).
It is beside the point that &quot;there was no system of public
education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed,&quot; ante, at 2529, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring);
because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have
made available for secular, public schools never materialized.
The fact that the bill, if passed, would have funded secular as
well as religious instruction did nothing to soften Madison's
opposition to it.
<P>
Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because
it treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 2529 (THOMAS,
J., concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison
did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions,
Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536, but to identify this
factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the bill is
unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed
against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the
Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one
point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of
those reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid
was being distributed equally among sects, and whether or not
the aid was going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded
government program. See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted
in Everson, 330 U.S., at 64, 67 S.Ct., at 535, p 1 (&quot;[I]n
matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution
of Civil Society, and ... Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance&quot;);
id., at 67, 67 S.Ct., at 536-537, p 6 (arguing that State support
of religion &quot;is a contradiction to the Christian Religion
itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers
of this world&quot;); ibid., p 7 (&quot;[E]xperience witnesseth
that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the
purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation&quot;).
Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous other petitions
in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that the
lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw. L. Levy, The
Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed.1994). For example, the petition
that received the largest number of signatories was motivated
by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily.
Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for
a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal
basis, and the outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of
the Virginia assessment was not such a bill; rather, it was the
Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed
in the text, proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes.
<P>
In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally
been targeted against &quot;governmental preferences for particular
religious faiths,&quot; ante, at 2530 (emphasis in original),

----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (SOUTER, J., concurring).
<P>
*2551_ FN2. Justice THOMAS attempts to cast doubt on this accepted
version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical
facts that are largely inapposite. Ante, at 2530-2531, 2533 (concurring
opinion). As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress,
especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as
an authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses,
for &quot;like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses]
could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs
on them the next. [For example,] ... [t]en years after proposing
the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the
early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would
have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room
for political censorship.&quot; Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
626, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2676, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (concurring
opinion). The legislation cited by Justice THOMAS, including the
Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the Alien and
Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even less persuasive,
then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating from
the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument,
they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on
the Framers' intent.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's references to Madison's actions as a legislator
also provide little support for his cause. Justice THOMAS seeks
to draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking
to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison
did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities.
Ante, at 2530 (concurring opinion). That was not the task at hand,
however. Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating
the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made
no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that
came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years
later. That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than
necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal
was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone too far.
Ibid.
<P>
Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional
committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides
no support for more general principles that run counter to settled
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed
out, Madison, upon retirement, &quot;insisted that 'it was not
with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of
religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they
appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' &quot;
Lee, supra, at 625, n. 6, 112 S.Ct., at 2675, n. 6, quoting Letter
from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'
Constitution, at 105. And when we turned our attention to deciding
whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment
problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a
larger class of permissible government funding of religious activities.
Instead, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791, 103 S.Ct. 3330,
3335-3336, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular,
200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that &quot;[t]his
unique history&quot; justified carving out an exception for the
specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding
this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would
stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it
a broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.
<P>
FN3. In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following
facts: &quot;The University of Virginia has charged at all times
relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a
compulsory student activity fee of $14.00 per semester. There
is no procedural or other mechanism by which a student may decline
to pay the fee.&quot; App. 37; see also App. 9, 21.
<P>
FN4. To the extent the Court perceives some distinction between
the printing and dissemination of evangelism and proselytization,
and core religious activity &quot;in [its] usual sense,&quot;
ante, at 2524, this distinction goes entirely unexplained in the
Court's opinion.
<P>
FN5. In a narrow band of cases at the polar extreme from direct
funding cases, those involving essential public benefits commonly
associated with living in an organized society (like police and
fire protection, for example), evenhandedness may become important
to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.
<P>
*2551_ FN6. In Zobrest, a deaf student sought to have an interpreter,
provided under a state Act aiding individuals with disabilities,
accompany him to a Roman Catholic high school. In Witters, a blind
student sought to use aid, provided under a state program for
assistance to handicapped persons, to attend a private Christian
college. In Mueller, parents sought to take a tax deduction, available
for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren, for certain
expenses incurred in connection with providing education for their
children in private religious schools.
<P>
FN7. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct.
1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), is yet another example of a case
in which the Court treated the general availability of a government
benefit as a significant condition defining compliance with the
Establishment Clause, but did not deem that condition sufficient.
In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious
organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable
to &quot;a broad class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasipublic
corporations,&quot; id., at 673, 90 S.Ct., at 1413, but did not
rest on that factor alone. Critical to our decision was the central
principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited
under the Establishment Clause. &quot;It is sufficient to note
that for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment
the 'establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity.&quot; Id., at 668, 90 S.Ct., at 1411. We emphasized
that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government
funds in support of religious activities. &quot;The grant of a
tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not
transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from
demanding that the church support the state.&quot; Id., at 675,
90 S.Ct., at 1415. Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation
context, &quot;exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote
involvement between church and state and far less than taxation
of churches,&quot; and in operation &quot;ten[d] to complement
and reinforce the desired separation insulating&quot; church and
state, id., at 676, 90 S.Ct., at 1415; and that religious property
tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without disruption
to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 676-680, 90 S.Ct., at 1415-1417.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's assertion, that &quot;[a] tax exemption in many
cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from
a direct monetary subsidy,&quot; ante, at 2531 (concurring opinion)
(footnote omitted), assumes that the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;
tax base is so self-evident that any provision excusing a person
or institution from taxes to which others are subjected must be
a departure from the natural tax base rather than part of the
definition of the tax base itself. The equivalence (asserted by
Justice THOMAS, ante, at 2531) between a direct money subsidy
and the tax liability avoided by an institution (because it is
part of the class of institutions that defines the relevant tax
base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched long ago by Professor
Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). Justice THOMAS's suggestion that my &quot;reliance
on Bittker ... is misplaced in this context,&quot; ante, at 2532,
n. 5, is not on point. Even granting that Justice THOMAS's assertion
of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the
fact that the Court in Walz explicitly distinguished tax exemptions
from direct money subsidies, 397 U.S., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1414,
and rested its decision on that distinction. If Justice THOMAS's
assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court necessarily
was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding. Justice
THOMAS can hardly use Walz coherently for support after removing
the basis on which it relies.
<P>
FN8. Although the main opinion in Tilton was a plurality, the
entire Court was unanimous on this point. See, 403 U.S., at 682-684,
91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (plurality opinion); id., at 692, 91 S.Ct.,
at 2102 (Douglas, J., joined by Black and Marshall, JJ., concurring
in part and dissenting in part);
<P>
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 659-661, 91 S.Ct. 2125, 2134-2135,
29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) (opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 665, n.
1, 91 S.Ct., at 2137, n. 1 (opinion of White, J.).
<P>
*2551_ FN9. Congress apparently also reads our cases as the University
did, for it routinely excludes religious activities from general
funding programs. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1062(b) (federal grant
program for institutions of higher education; &quot;[n]o grant
may be made under this chapter for any educational program, activity,
or service related to sectarian instruction or religious worship,
or provided by a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1069c (certain grants to higher education institutions &quot;may
not be used ... for a school or department of divinity or any
religious worship or sectarian activity ...&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1132c-3(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal assistance for renovation
of certain academic facilities; &quot;[n]o loan may be made under
this part for any educational program, activity or service related
to sectarian instruction or religious worship or provided by a
school or department of divinity or to an institution in which
a substantial portion of its functions is subsumed in a religious
mission&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1132i(c) (grant program for educational
facilities;
<P>
&quot;no project assisted with funds under this subchapter shall
ever be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or
for a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec.
1213d (&quot;No grant may be made under this chapter for any educational
program, activity, or service related to sectarian instruction
or religious worship, or provided by a school or department of
divinity&quot;); 25 U.S.C. Sec. 3306(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (funding
for Indian higher education programs; &quot;[n]one of the funds
made available under this subchapter may be used for study at
any school or department of divinity or for any religious worship
or sectarian activity&quot;); 29 U.S.C. Sec. 776(g) (grants for
projects and activities for rehabilitation of handicapped persons;
&quot;[n]o funds provided under this subchapter may be used to
assist in the construction of any facility which is or will be
used for religious worship or any sectarian activity&quot;); 42
U.S.C. Sec. 3027(a)(14)(A)(iv) (requiring states seeking federal
aid for construction of centers for the elderly to submit plans
providing assurances that &quot;the facilit[ies] will not be used
and [are] not intended to be used for sectarian instruction or
as ... place[s] for religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5001(a)(2)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal grants to support volunteer projects
for the elderly, but not including &quot;projects involving the
construction, operation, or maintenance of so much of any facility
used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for
religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9858k(a) (1988 ed., Supp.
V) (no child care and development block grants &quot;shall be
expended for any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian
worship or instruction&quot;).
<P>
FN10. The Court acknowledges that &quot;if the State pays a church's
bills it is subsidizing it,&quot; and concedes that &quot;we must
guard against this abuse.&quot; Ante, at 2524. These concerns
are not present here, the Court contends, because Wide Awake &quot;is
not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that
term as used in our case law.&quot; Ibid. The Court's concession
suggests that its distinction between paying a religious institution
and paying a religious institution's bills is not really significant.
But if the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake
as not a religious institution, &quot;at least in the usual sense,&quot;
the Court could presumably stop right there.
<P>
FN11. The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of public
funds to advance its own speech and the State's funding of private
speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related choices
is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the former.
Ante, at 2518-2519. I would not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-273, 108 S.Ct. 562,
569-571, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988), but I do suggest that this case
reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in drawing this
distinction. There is a communicative element inherent in the
very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,
15-19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-635, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam
), and although it is the student speakers who choose which particular
messages to advance in the forum created by the University, the
initial act of defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision
attributable to the University, not the students. In any event,
even assuming that private and state speech always may be separated
by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I
believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed
infra, this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination. *2551_
FN12. I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public
university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech
Clause. If, however, the determinations are made on the basis
of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint
distinction, there is no violation. In a limited-access forum,
a speech restriction must be &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum&quot; as well as viewpoint-neutral.
E.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147, quoting
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439. Because petitioners
have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable,
I express no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness
criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that
it applies in limited-access forum cases.
<P>
FN13. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 51, 121 L.Ed.2d
20, where counsel for the school district charged with enforcing
the restriction unequivocally admitted that anyone with an atheistic
or antireligious message would be permitted to use school property
under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The complete
exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as follows:
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address
the subject of family values and they thought there was a value
in not having children waste their time going to Sunday school
or church and therefore they had a point of view that was definitely
antireligious, they would be permitted, under your policy, to
discuss family values in that context?
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the
Court] you indicated that communists would be able to give their
perspective on family. I--I assume from that that atheists would
be able to give theirs under your rules.
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.&quot;

Before ERVIN, Chief Judge, WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, and SPROUSE,
Senior Circuit Judge.
<P>
OPINION
<P>
ERVIN, Chief Judge:
<P>
We must decide whether a state university's refusal to disburse
monies from its student activities fund for the benefit of a student-run
religious publication violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution. We hold that it does not.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
The University of Virginia collects a mandatory student activities
fee of fourteen dollars per semester, together with tuition payments,
from each of its full-time students. The proceeds of the collection
are deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (&quot;SAF&quot;),
which is used to support the wide variety of student organizations,
activities, and publications that function at the University.
<P>
To qualify for student-activity-fee funds, a student group first
must attain the status of a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot;
(&quot;CIO&quot;) at the University. CIO status is available to
any group that is composed in its majority of students, is managed
by officers who are full-time students, keeps an updated copy
of its constitution on file with the University, and signs an
anti-discrimination disclaimer. CIOs are given access to University
facilities, including meeting rooms and computer terminals, as
well as the right to apply for student-activity-fee funds. The
standard CIO agreement executed between qualified student groups
and the University states that benefits provided to the groups
by the University
<P>
should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations
are part of or controlled by the University, that the University
is responsible for the organizations' *271 contracts or other
acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations'
goals or activities.
<P>
As the corporate body responsible under state law for governing
the institution, (FN1) the Rector and Visitors of the University
of Virginia (&quot;Rector and Visitors&quot;) wield ultimate decisionmaking
power over the operation of the SAF. The Rector and Visitors have
delegated responsibility for allocating SAF monies to the University's
Student Council. A CIO seeking an SAF grant must submit a detailed
application for funding to the Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council, which approves or denies the request.
Appeal from a denial of funding by the Appropriations Committee
may be taken to the full Student Council. Upon the Council's affirmance
of the Appropriations Committee's decision, a second appeal may
be argued before the University's Student Activities Committee,
a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for
Student Affairs.
<P>
The decisions of each of these authorities with respect to awards
of SAF monies must be taken in compliance with certain guidelines
promulgated by the Rector and Visitors. These guidelines, adopted
in 1970, charge the Student Council with administering the SAF
&quot;in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the
University as well as with State and Federal law.&quot; The guidelines
prohibit several categories of student organizations from obtaining
SAF funds, according to the nature of the organization and the
purpose for which the funds would be used. Although they may attain
CIO status, fraternities and sororities, political and religious
organizations, and groups whose membership policies are exclusionary
in nature are ineligible for SAF funding. The following expenditures
and activities also are excluded by the guidelines: (1) honoraria
or similar fees; (2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment
and related expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities;
and (5) political activities. (FN2)
<P>
Once a student organization attains CIO status and becomes eligible
for funding, the guidelines prescribe the following criteria for
allocating SAF monies among CIOs: (1) the size of the group; (2)
the University-wide benefits conferred by the group's activities;
and (3) the group's financial self-sufficiency. After a student
organization is approved for funding, it submits expense vouchers
to the SAF, which are paid only upon a determination that a particular
expense is fundable under the guidelines. SAF monies are not paid
to the group, but are disbursed directly to the group's creditors
to discharge the fundable expense.
<P>
For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations qualified
as CIOs. Of these 343 groups, 135 applied for SAF funding, and
118 were awarded SAF monies. Numbered among the funded organizations
were fifteen student publications; (FN3) also included were the
Muslim Students Association, the Jewish Law Students Association,
and the C.S. Lewis Society.
<P>
B
<P>
In September 1990 Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate at the
University, joined with other University students to found Wide
Awake Productions. According to its constitution, Wide Awake Productions
is an unincorporated association with the stated purposes of (1)
&quot;publishing a magazine *272 of philosophical and religious
expression&quot;; (2) &quot;facilitating discussion which fosters
an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints&quot;;
and (3) &quot;providing a unifying focus for Christians of multicultural
backgrounds.&quot; Wide Awake Productions publishes Wide Awake:
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia (&quot;Wide
Awake &quot;), a nonprofit journal written and edited by the student
members of Wide Awake Productions. As stated by Rosenberger, who
serves as editor-in-chief of Wide Awake, the journal (FN4) was
launched when the members of Wide Awake Productions &quot;realized
that none of the fifteen student-run publications at the University
provided a forum for Christian expression,&quot; and decided to
fill this perceived void. See &quot;Letter from the Editor,&quot;
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia,
Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. Wide Awake and Wide Awake Productions are
not affiliated with any religious institution, and allow any University
student to join without regard to sex, race, religion, or color.
<P>
At the time notice of the instant appeal was filed, three issues
of Wide Awake had been published, with approximately 5,000 copies
of each issue being distributed free of charge to persons on the
University campus. According to editor Rosenberger's comments
in the first issue, Wide Awake 's mission is twofold: &quot;to
challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the
faith they proclaim[,] and to encourage students to consider what
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Id. In
furtherance of this mission, Wide Awake &quot;offers a Christian
perspective on both personal and community issues, especially
those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia.&quot;
Id.
<P>
The content of the three issues of Wide Awake published thus far
forms part of the record in this case. The first issue's cover
story, &quot;Eracing Mistakes,&quot; offered Christian solutions
for the enduring calamity of racism, see id. at 1, 12-14; other
articles treated such diverse issues as &quot;crisis pregnancy,&quot;
Oxford Christian apologeticist C.S. Lewis's ideas about evil and
free will, &quot;beating stress,&quot; and &quot;praying with
a thankful heart,&quot; all written from an avowedly Christian
stance. See id. at 4-5, 6-8, 15, 21. The featured contribution
in the second issue, &quot;Out of the Closet and Into the Light,&quot;
addressed the question &quot;How should the Church respond to
homosexuals ... and vice versa?&quot; See id., Mar./Apr.1991,
at 1, 14-17. The second issue also included an interview with
a Christian professor of mathematics at the University, an article
on Christian missionary work throughout the world, and two commentaries
offering spiritual guidance (titled respectively &quot;God's Word:
<P>
A Spiritual Advantage,&quot; and &quot;On Your Own: Hope and Spirit&quot;).
See id. at 5-7, 11-13, 20-21. The third issue contained articles
about a University graduate's experiences as a missionary in Moldavia,
eating disorders (titled &quot;From Calorie to Calvary&quot;),
and a Christian musician (&quot;Keith Green: Piano Man for Christ&quot;).
See id., Sept.-Oct. 1991, at 5-7, 12-14, 18-20. Columns in all
three issues reviewed newly released recordings of music of religious
disposition. (FN5) *273 The plaintiffs do not dispute that in
publishing Wide Awake they are engaged in a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot;
as the SAF guidelines define the phrase. (FN6) Indeed, after reading
its contents dispassionately, we are compelled to mark Wide Awake
's unflagging (FN7) invocation of religious, specifically Christian,
themes. The journal's pages are pervasively devoted to providing
a &quot;Christian perspective&quot; in printer's ink at the University
of Virginia. Wide Awake 's editorial stance extends to its advertising
sales: by the public release of the third issue represented in
the record (dated September/October 1991), roughly eighty percent
of the journal's five commercial and notice columns were given
over to Christian churches or to business entities purveying goods
and services of Christian bent. (FN8) Even Wide Awake 's physical
appearance draws attention to its religious posture:
<P>
the Christian symbol of the Cross, lying in a dark oval field,
is printed at the top of each page; another Cross marks the end
of each contribution.
<P>
Wide Awake Productions attained CIO status shortly after its founding.
Commensurate with this status, as the plaintiffs acknowledge,
the University openly accords Wide Awake Productions the same
access to University facilities as other CIOs. Such access includes
the use of University property for the group's meetings, functions,
and programs. CIO status affords the members of Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to University computer terminals, printers, and
other equipment employed in the preparation of manuscripts for

<P>
In January 1991, Ronald W. Rosenberger, on behalf of Wide Awake
Productions, submitted an application for SAF funding to the Appropriations
Committee of the Student Council in the amount of $5,862.00, to
cover publishing costs for Wide Awake. On February 26 of that
year the Appropriations Committee denied Rosenberger's application,
stating:
<P>
In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the ...
<P>
Committee determined your organization's request could not be
funded as it is a religious activity. This determination was made
after reviewing your first issue of Wide Awake. In particular,
the committee noted in your Editor's Letter that the publication
was &quot;a forum for Christian expression&quot; and a means &quot;to
challenge Christians (in how) to live&quot;....
<P>
Please be aware that this decision simply denies Student Activity
Fee funding for your publication. Wide Awake Productions may still
print and distribute issues on Grounds. (FN9)
<P>
The members of Wide Awake Productions promptly appealed the decision
to the full Student Council on March 3, 1991, contending that
their organization had satisfied all applicable SAF funding guidelines
and that the Appropriations Committee's denial of funding violated
the Constitution of the United States. The Student Council affirmed
the Appropriations Committee's decision without comment.
<P>
*274 Wide Awake Productions then appealed the Student Council's
ruling to the University's Student Activities Committee. On April
16, 1991, Associate Dean of Students Ronald J. Stump informed
Rosenberger of the Student Activities Committee's decision to
affirm the funding denial. Stump wrote:
<P>
After reviewing your organization's constitution, copies of the
magazine's first two editions, and the arguments presented at
last week's appeal by Wide Awake Productions and by [the] Student
Council, the Committee determined that the Wide Awake magazine
could not be funded as it is a religious activity. In effect,
the Student Activities Committee fully supports the decision and
reasoning provided to you in the February 26 letter from [the
Appropriations Committee]. As noted in [that] letter, Wide Awake
Productions may still print and distribute copies of the magazine
and as a CIO has full and equal access to other University facilities
and services.
<P>
The Student Activities Committee's repudiation exhausted all internal
avenues of appeal within the University for the institution's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
C
<P>
On July 11, 1991, the members of Wide Awake Productions brought
this action against the Rector and Visitors and Dean Stump pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
(FN10) The plaintiffs' complaint set forth three challenges to
the SAF guidelines' exclusion of &quot;religious activities,&quot;
including the publication of Wide Awake, from eligibility for
funding consideration, each predicated upon provisions of the
Constitution of the United States. To each of the plaintiffs'
federal constitutional claims were appended alternative and supplemental
claims seeking recovery under the provisions of Article I of the
Constitution of Virginia (FN11) and, in the case of Count Two,
under the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993). The plaintiffs did not
challenge directly the University's refusal to fund Wide Awake
Productions, except insofar as the adverse funding decisions flowed
directly from the requirements of the guidelines themselves.
<P>
(FN12)
<P>
Count One, the complaint's most comprehensive theory of recovery,
alleged that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for the
publication costs of Wide Awake violated the Free Speech and Press
Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
(FN13) and Article I, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution
(FN14) (1) by unlawfully depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions
of government benefits solely because of the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake; and (2) by illegally excluding
the members of Wide Awake Productions from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; created by the Rector and Visitors' establishment
of the SAF and promulgation of the funding guidelines. Count One
also contended that the guidelines' &quot;definitions for allocating
SAF funds to CIOs&quot; are unconstitutionally vague because persons
of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning, and unlawfully
*275 overbroad because they impinge constitutionally protected
activity.
<P>
Count Two of the complaint maintained that the guidelines' denial
of SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; violated the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
(FN15) Article I, Section 16 of the Virginia Constitution, (FN16)
and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993), (FN17) by discriminating
in the granting of a government benefit based upon (1) the religious
content of the expression in Wide Awake; and (2) the religious
beliefs, character, or affiliation of the members of Wide Awake
Productions. Count Two also imputed to the Rector and Visitors
&quot;conduct constitut[ing] a failure to give reasonable accommodation
to the plaintiffs' religious beliefs.&quot;
<P>
Count Three of the complaint alleged that the guidelines' prohibition
against subsidizing &quot;religious activit[ies],&quot; coupled
with the Rector and Visitors' denial of SAF funds to Wide Awake
Productions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution (FN18) and the Anti-Discrimination
Clause of Article I, Section 11 of the Virginia Constitution.
(FN19) Specifically, Count Three contended (1) that the guidelines
&quot;den[ied] plaintiffs the benefits to which other students
and CIOs are entitled&quot; by unconstitutionally discriminating
against Wide Awake Productions on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of its members' speech and association; and (2) that
the guidelines unconstitutionally discriminated against the plaintiffs'
religious speech &quot;by denying [them] the benefits that other
students and CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities receive
and have received....&quot; This viewpoint- and religious-based
discrimination, Count Three maintained, was not justified by a
compelling state interest, nor was it narrowly tailored to achieve
whatever minimal interest the Rector and Visitors may have in
refusing to fund student &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
The plaintiffs sought redress for their alleged injuries in the
form of (1) a declaratory judgment that the guidelines' prohibition
against the funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; violated
their rights under the United States Constitution, the Virginia
Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom; (2)
a permanent order enjoining the Rector and Visitors from promulgating
any proscription against the funding of Wide Awake Productions
on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its members' speech
in Wide Awake;
<P>
(3) compensatory damages of at least $5,862.00, the sum of SAF
funds unconstitutionally denied Wide Awake Productions; and (4)
an order awarding Wide Awake Productions reasonable costs and
attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988. (FN20)
<P>
*276 Agreeing that there were no material facts at issue, both
parties sought summary judgment as a matter of law. After hearing
oral argument on their opposing motions, the district court granted
summary judgment in favor of the Rector and Visitors on each count
of the plaintiffs' complaint, concluding (1) that the SAF was
not a &quot;limited public forum;&quot; (2) that application of
the funding guidelines did not result in viewpoint or content
discrimination against the speech of Wide Awake Productions; and
(3) that the denial of funding did not burden the plaintiffs'
free exercise of religion. See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 795 F.Supp. 175, 178-83 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.).
The court also held that the plaintiffs' equal
<P>
protection challenge to the guidelines failed because the members
of Wide Awake Productions had not adduced evidence of the Rector
and Visitors' discriminatory intent. Although the district court
did not scrutinize the complaint's allegations that the guidelines
violated the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, it held that the restrictions on funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; did not &quot;impose an impermissible burden
on the plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by ...
the State Constitution[ ], or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.&quot;
Id. at 17.
<P>
This appeal followed.
<P>
II
<P>
Before addressing the substance of the plaintiffs' assignments
of error, we wish to make clear what precisely is at issue in
this appeal. The complaint alleges that the Rector and Visitors
have violated rights guaranteed the plaintiffs by the Constitution
of the United States, the Constitution of Virginia, and the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom. Two of these sources derive from the
substantive law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such, they
comprise fonts of individual liberties independent of the Federal
Constitution, and are therefore susceptible of autonomous interpretation
by the courts of the Commonwealth. (FN21) Although the district
court embraced these pendent state-law claims in its favorable
grant of summary judgment to the Rector and Visitors, (FN22) they
were not controverted by the parties at the summary judgment hearing,
and were not subjected to independent scrutiny on their merits
below. We have no objective basis, therefore, upon which to assume
that any interpretation of the Virginia Constitution or the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom contributed separately to the judgment
from which this appeal was taken. The parties have not attempted
to resuscitate them in their briefs or at oral argument. To bring
grounds for relief to the attention of an appellate tribunal,
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure oblige the parties to
offer a written argument ... contain[ing] [their] contentions
... with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities ... and parts of the record
relied on.
<P>
Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5), (b). We observe that none of the briefs
filed by either party in this court contains &quot;contentions&quot;
about the application of the Virginia Constitution's Declaration
of Rights or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom to the instant
case, or &quot;citations to ... authorities&quot; that might illuminate
the special rights the state charter and religious-freedom statute
are said to guarantee. We therefore are compelled to conclude
that the parties have failed to appeal the district court's grant
of summary judgment with respect to these state-law theories of
recovery. Failure of this nature constitutes abandonment of the
claims, and precludes us from considering them further herein.
See Shopco Distrib. Co. v. Commanding Gen., 885 F.2d 167, 170
n. 3 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that failure to comply with terms
of former version of Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5) constitutes waiver
of asserted claims).
<P>
*277 Therefore, the scope of our inquiry is confined to such of
the plaintiffs' assignments of error as rest upon the Constitution
of the United States. These are two. (FN23) First, the plaintiffs
contend that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of
the First Amendment (1) by depriving them of government benefits
based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech in Wide
Awake, and (2) by excluding them from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; represented by the SAF. Second, the plaintiffs argue
that the guidelines' funding restrictions discriminate against
them in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment (1) by denying them benefits which other CIOs engaged
in religious speech and activities have received, and (2) because
the restrictions serve no compelling state interest, and are not
narrowly tailored to satisfy whatever minimal interest the Rector
and Visitors may have in denying funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
In the discussion that follows, we address these two claims in
turn, reviewing the legal conclusions on which the district court
granted summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., Brock v. Entre Computer
Ctrs., Inc., 933 F.2d 1253, 1259 (4th Cir.1991).
<P>
III
<P>
First, we examine the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
by depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions of government
benefits based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech
in Wide Awake.
<P>
A
<P>
Because our decision rests ultimately upon our understanding of
the language of the First Amendment, we here undertake cursory
review of certain principles of constitutional interpretation
that guide our deliberations.
<P>
Like their cultural and ideological ancestors the Magna Carta
(1215) and the English Bill of Rights (1688), the first ten amendments
to the Federal Constitution represent what Justice Story called
&quot;a solemn recognition of limitations upon the power of parliament;
that is, a declaration, that parliament ought not to abolish,
or restrict&quot; certain fundamental rights of the person. III
Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States
Sec. 980, at 695 (1833). Taken as a whole, the provisions of the
Bill of Rights form a stout bulwark against government encroachment
upon the fundamental liberties of every person within the jurisdiction
of the United States. The amendments weigh as a counterpoise to
the specifically enumerated powers granted by the people of the
several states to their national government in the first three
Articles of the Federal Constitution.
<P>
By its terms the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
reflects the limiting purpose of the Bill of Rights. The Clause
pronounces the federal legislature's impotence to curb any individual's
freedom to express verbally her views upon any subject; it states
that Congress shall &quot;make no law ... abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 3
(emphasis added). While the First Amendment thus represents a
guarantee that freedom will be preserved in the face of legislative
ambition, it goes no further. Although the Amendment preserves
inviolate the individual's right to speak, it sustains speech
itself only indirectly. The Speech and Press Clause cannot be
metamorphosed into a promise that the federal government will
purchase a bullhorn, paper, and ink for the convenience of every
garrulous member of the American populace. The Constitution does
not guarantee the American people the means of self-expression;
it simply pledges that Congress (and, through application of *278
the Fourteenth Amendment, the states (FN24)) will not enact laws
or regulations restraining at its inception a person's right freely
to speak her views and to disseminate them by every means at her
disposal. A century and six decades after the publication of his
commentaries on our national charter, Justice Story's expression
of this principle retains all its peerless power:
<P>
That this amendment was intended to secure to every citizen an
absolute right to speak, or write, or print, whatever he might
please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor,
is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man....
It is plain, then, that the language of the amendment imports
no more, than that every man shall have a right to speak, write,
and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without prior
restraint....
<P>
Story, supra, Sec. 993, at 703-04.
<P>
B
<P>
With these interpretative precepts firmly in hand, we turn to
the assignment of error lodged by the plaintiffs.
<P>
The plaintiffs do not suggest that the Rector and Visitors have
restrained them from speaking, writing, or printing commentary
upon religious themes, or indeed upon any other subject, on the
campus or within the purview of the University of Virginia. As
they freely admit, Wide Awake Productions is afforded the full
benefits of CIO status by the University. Its members are granted
the same access to meeting rooms on University grounds as other
CIOs, and are given generous run of University property for their
work and programs. The University affords Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to its computer terminals, printers, and other
equipment used to prepare manuscripts for publication. With the
University's full consent, the plaintiffs have thus far distributed
several thousand copies of Wide Awake on University grounds. The
plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot, suggest, therefore, that the
Rector and Visitors have placed a per se unconstitutional prior
restraint upon their freedom actually to speak or to publish their
views by denying them equal access to University facilities. Cf.
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278, 70 L.Ed.2d
440 (1981) (discussing erection of prior restraint against student
organization's use of state university property); Healy v. James,
408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2345, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972)
(same).
<P>
Nor is the plaintiffs' complaint simply that the Rector and Visitors
have refused to pay for the publication of their speech with treasure
from the University fisc. If such were the nature of this dispute,
we might leave the field of independent analysis fallow. For there
is no question that the Commonwealth of Virginia, like any private
owner of property, may preserve the land and chattels under its
control for the use to which they are dedicated, and decline to
lend them for other purposes. E.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;
Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3447-3448,
87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'
Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
As agents of the Commonwealth, the Rector and Visitors need not
subsidize extracurricular student activities in any form. Healy
v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 182 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346 n. 8, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). Having undertaken such subsidies, they need
not have promulgated criteria by which the Student Council could
differentiate between competing funding requests. Nor are the
Rector and Visitors under any affirmative obligation to ensure
that University students' expressive *279 activities are funded.
In language redolent of Justice Story's pointed commentary on
the Speech and Press Clause, the Supreme Court has rejected the
notion that the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the
press &quot;are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized
by the state.&quot; Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461
U.S. 540, 546, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2001, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983).
<P>
The Student Council's exercise of discretion in withholding SAF
monies from Wide Awake Productions is not, therefore, the basis
of the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs contend, instead,
that once the Rector and Visitors have chosen to promulgate guidelines
governing the allocation of funds that support student speech
among competing student interests, such guidelines cannot condition
funding awards on the content or viewpoint of a prospective recipient's
speech. The Rector and Visitors have violated the First Amendment,
the plaintiffs maintain, by denying them the benefit of a University-funded
SAF grant on grounds that their publication of Wide Awake constitutes
a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; (FN25) within the meaning of
the guidelines. Such discrimination contravenes the First Amendment,
they assert, because it implicitly condemns the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake. This content and viewpoint discrimination
imposes a prior restraint upon the ability of Wide Awake Productions
to enjoy government largesse, and, the plaintiffs contend, must
therefore be struck down.
<P>
C
<P>
Having identified the constitutional character of the plaintiffs'
first assignment of error, we proceed to seek its resolution.
<P>
The notion that, whenever a government benefit or privilege might
be withheld altogether, it may be withheld on whatever conditions
government chooses to impose, has been thoroughly repudiated by
the Supreme Court since the middle of this century. See, e.g.,
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 405, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-1795,
10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518,
526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958); see also
Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 11-5, at 781-84
(2d ed. 1988) (discussing &quot;elusive&quot; distinction between
withholding a government subsidy for and imposing a penalty upon
exercise of a constitutional right).
<P>
Unconstitutional conditions, which make enjoyment of a government
benefit contingent on sacrifice of an independent constitutional
right, are prima facie invalid. For if the government could deny
a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected
speech ..., his exercise of th[at] freedom[ ] would in effect
be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to
&quot;produce a result which [it] could not command directly.&quot;
Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.
<P>
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33
L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (quoting Speiser, 357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct.
at 1342). Whether a condition is unconstitutional depends on whether
the government may properly demand sacrifice of the particular
right asserted in the context of its exercise. FCC v. League of
Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 380, 395, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3117, 3125,
82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984).
<P>
We must decide whether the guidelines' prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; *280 imposes an unconstitutional
condition upon receipt of the government benefit inherent in an
award of SAF monies by infringing the plaintiffs' claimed First
Amendment right to indulge religious expression. This decision
harbors a two-part inquiry. First, we must determine whether the
publication of Wide Awake constitutes &quot;speech&quot; protected
by the Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment. If we so
decide, we then must ask whether the Rector and Visitors are imposing
an unconstitutional condition upon the exercise of the plaintiffs'
protected speech; that is, we must determine whether the Rector
and Visitors are demanding that the members of Wide Awake Productions
cease publishing religious speech in Wide Awake before they may
become eligible (FN26) for an award of SAF funds.
<P>
1.
<P>
With respect to the first part of this inquiry, we easily conclude
that the plaintiffs' publication of religious speech in Wide Awake
falls within the protective ambit of the Speech and Press Clause.
There is no question that discussions of religion are, as they
long have been, a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.
See, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563-2564, 69 L.Ed.2d
298 (1981); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 561-62, 68 S.Ct. 1148,
1150-51, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948). Although the Rector and Visitors'
prohibition of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
is not directed exclusively at religious speech, the phrase &quot;religious
activit[y]&quot; as defined in the guidelines necessarily encompasses
speech that &quot;primarily promotes or manifests a particular
belief[ ] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; The
word &quot;activity&quot; is defined as &quot;an occupation, pursuit,
or recreation in which a person is active,&quot; Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 22 (1976).
<P>
There can be no doubt that the publication of a journal of religious
expression is precisely such an occupation, pursuit, or recreation.
<P>
2.
<P>
Having answered the first prong of the inquiry affirmatively,
we address the second prong: Have the Rector and Visitors effectively
demanded that the members of Wide Awake Productions cease publishing
religious commentary in Wide Awake before they may become &quot;eligible&quot;
for an award of SAF funds? We conclude that they have.
<P>
The guidelines lay upon the Student Council an affirmative obligation
not to fund &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot; This obligation
means that religious expression, such as that in Wide Awake, is
never allowed to compete for funds with other forms of speech
that might be indulged by University students. Even if a student
organization achieves CIO status, to the extent that its pursuits
and functions consist of religious speech, the organization's
funding requests will be summarily rejected by the Student Council.
In effect, then, the Rector and Visitors' restriction has operated
to erect a prior restraint on University subsidization of all
forms of religious expression in which a CIO might engage. While
we acknowledge that a CIO has no right to funding by the Rector
and Visitors, see, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124
L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), when funds are made available to CIOs generally,
*281 they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
considerations of equal constitutional dignity. See Board of Educ.
v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2370-71, 110 L.Ed.2d
191 (1990) (plurality opinion); Grand Rapids Sch. Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 382, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3221-22, 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985);
<P>
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 746, 96 S.Ct. 2337,
2344-45, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976) (plurality opinion); Everson v.
Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 18, 67 S.Ct. 504, 513, 91 L.Ed. 711
(1947). Although government need not subsidize exercise of a constitutional
right, the lack of an affirmative duty of financial support does
not mean that government may, in general, penalize exercise of
constitutional rights by withholding from their possessors an
otherwise discretionary benefit.
<P>
We conclude that the Rector and Visitors' erection of a prior
restraint against University funding of such &quot;religious activities&quot;
as the publication of religious expression in Wide Awake constitutes
precisely such a penalty, because it restrains Wide Awake Productions
from gaining access altogether to a funding source generally available
to CIOs not engaged in religious expression. (FN27) This prior
restraint ultimately forces the members of Wide Awake Productions--unlike
their nonsectarian CIO colleagues--to seek financial sustenance
for their speech from coffers outside the University. The Rector
and Visitors' funding proscription thus creates an uneven playing
field on which the advantage is tilted towards CIOs engaged in
wholly secular modes of expression.
<P>
We hold, therefore, that the Rector and Visitors have conditioned
the plaintiffs' receipt of government benefits upon their foregoing
constitutionally protected religious expression.
<P>
D
<P>
In reaching and forbidding funding for speech that meets the definition
of &quot;religious activity,&quot; but not for speech of other
types, the SAF guidelines discriminate among speech on the basis
of its content. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 229-30, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-28, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
In order to justify differential treatment of funding eligibility
based on the content of the speech involved, &quot;the State must
show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.&quot; Id.
at 231, 107 S.Ct. at 1729; see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.
263, 270, 102 S.Ct. 269, 274, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461, 464-65, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 2292-93,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 184, 92 S.Ct.
2338, 2347-48, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). It is to this inquiry that
we now turn.
<P>
In defense of the guidelines' prohibition, the Rector and Visitors
claim a compelling interest in maintaining strict separation of
church and state. (FN28) They derive this interest *282 from the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which admonishes
Congress (and, through application of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the states (FN29)) to &quot;make no law respecting an establishment
of religion.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 1. The Rector and
Visitors argue that they cannot fund &quot;religious activities&quot;
without violating the Establishment Clause.
<P>
We agree with the Rector and Visitors that their interest as state
officials in complying with federal constitutional obligations,
including avoiding the creation of an &quot;establishment&quot;
of religion at the University of Virginia, may be characterized
as compelling. See Widmar, 454 U.S. at 271, 102 S.Ct. at 275.
It does not follow, however, that offering Wide Awake Productions
an equal opportunity to compete for SAF funds necessarily would
be incompatible with the Establishment Clause. Id.
<P>
That government largesse ultimately should redound to the benefit
of persons engaged in promoting religion does not necessarily
entail violation of the Establishment Clause. If such were the
case, &quot;a church could not be protected by the police and
fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair.&quot;
Id. at 274-75, 102 S.Ct. at 277. Moreover, such an extreme position
is plainly contrary to many of the Supreme Court's decisions upholding
government aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools.
See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S.
----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-67, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(summarizing the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence with
respect to government aid to parochial schools).
<P>
To test the Rector and Visitors' Establishment Clause justification
for the guidelines' funding policy, then, we must consider whether
awarding SAF monies to the members of Wide Awake Productions to
defray the publication costs of Wide Awake would constitute an
&quot;establishment of religion&quot; at the University of Virginia.
In making this determination, we seek enlightenment in the Supreme
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. That jurisprudence
holds that a governmental policy will not offend the Establishment
Clause if it can pass constitutional muster under the three-pronged
test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d
745 (1971), which guides &quot;[t]he general nature of our inquiry
in this area,&quot; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394, 103 S.Ct.
3062, 3066, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983):
<P>
First, the [governmental policy] must have a secular legislative
purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion ...; finally, the [policy]
must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.
<P>
Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. (FN30) *283 In
the paragraphs that follow, we consider the Rector and Visitors'
Establishment Clause justification for prohibiting SAF funding
of &quot;religious activities&quot; in light of Lemon. (FN31)
<P>
1.
<P>
Lemon 's first prong focuses on the &quot;purpose that animated&quot;
the Rector and Visitors' adoption of the SAF funding guidelines,
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 585, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2578,
96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), and asks whether that purpose was secular.
<P>
The obvious point of departure for analyzing the purpose of the
guidelines is the Rector and Visitors' comments at the time of
their adoption. Although the guidelines are the result of largely
undocumented deliberations by the Rector and Visitors, and thus
cannot be said to possess a &quot;legislative history&quot; as
that term usually is understood, they do contain a &quot;Student
Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; relevant to our deliberations.
This statement reads:
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
The funding guidelines themselves, which immediately follow the
&quot;Student Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; and are
part of the *284 same document, were adopted by the Rector and
Visitors in an attempt to give practical effect to the SAF's goal
of providing financial support for student organizations related
to the University's educational purpose. In the third section
of the guidelines, titled &quot;Student Expenditures and Activities
Not Eligible for Funding,&quot; the Rector and Visitors proscribed
funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; on the ground that
such activities &quot;do not relate to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot;
<P>
These statements make clear that the Rector and Visitors' aim
in denying SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; was
to comply with the University of Virginia's educational function--a
facially secular legislative purpose. (FN32) Because religion
is taught and studied as a subject of formal academic inquiry
at the University, however, the plaintiffs contend that religious
expression forms part of the institution's educational &quot;purpose.&quot;
They argue, therefore, that the University, already having admitted
religious discussion formally into the academic curriculum, can
have no stake in depriving such discussion of access to its coffers,
even if the source of the discussion is a student organization.
<P>
We disagree. That religion is studied at the University does not
mean that offering SAF funding to Wide Awake would promote the
essentially secular &quot;educational purpose&quot; of the institution,
or that such funding necessarily would not threaten the Establishment
Clause. Since its founding by Thomas Jefferson in the second decade
of the nineteenth century, the University's educational purpose
has included teaching and scholarship on a wide array of subjects,
(FN33) including the organized study of religious systems. As
the plaintiffs note, while serving as Rector of the University
Jefferson explained that no professorship of divinity had been
established &quot;in conformity with the principles of [the] constitution,
which place all sects of religion on an equal footing,&quot; but
that arrangements would be made to allow various denominations
to establish schools &quot;on the confines of the University&quot;
and to allow them access to University facilities. 19 The Writings
of Thomas Jefferson 408 (A. Bergh ed., 1905) (report to University
Visitors dated Oct. 7, 1822). That such &quot;schools&quot; were
incorporated into the University's intellectual and academic life
does not prevent the Rector and Visitors from employing funding
restrictions to advance the &quot;secular purpose&quot; of avoiding
an establishment of religion at the institution.
<P>
As we see it, it is clear from the SAF's statement of purpose
that the funding guidelines were motivated primarily, if not entirely,
by a legitimate secular purpose--the advancement of the University
of Virginia's educational mission. We do not question the propriety
of, nor the secular motivation for, the Rector and Visitors' interest
in preserving University funds for the institution's educational
mission. The Rector and Visitors do not dispute that, on the whole,
religious concerns were not the sole motivation behind the guidelines.
See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1362,
79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). The record gives us no reason to doubt
that the Rector and Visitors' expressed purposes are &quot;sincere
and not a sham.&quot; Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 1366. Therefore,
we hold that the guidelines' proscription against funding of &quot;religious
activit[ies]&quot; is not motivated wholly by an impermissible
purpose, and does not offend the Establishment Clause.
<P>
2.
<P>
As is usual in Establishment Clause cases, see, e.g., Grand Rapids
School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 383-98, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3222-30,
*285 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), the more subtle question is whether
the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions is to inhibit
or advance religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111.
<P>
Although we concluded above that the prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; denies religious speech the same
access to the SAF accorded secular speech, and thus violates the
Speech and Press Clause, whether &quot;religion&quot; is thereby
inhibited or advanced is a different matter. The Rector and Visitors
have not attempted to ban the publication of Wide Awake; indeed,
they have supported its religious mission by allowing the members
of Wide Awake Productions access to University meeting and printing
facilities equal to that afforded all other CIOs. The University
permits the plaintiffs to distribute Wide Awake on its grounds
without limitation.
<P>
Notwithstanding its refusal to subsidize the journal directly,
the University's sustenance of religion in these incidental respects
does not, in our view, inhibit religion. The University's policy
of allowing the members of Wide Awake Productions open access
to campus facilities accords the plaintiffs ample opportunity
to express their religious views, and leaves the University community
as a whole free to read and consider them. The Rector and Visitors'
funding policy simply declines to take the additional step of
actively subscribing University funds to Wide Awake 's particular
religious perspective. Under such circumstances as these, we are
unpersuaded that the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions,
involving as they do only the direct allocation of public monies,
would be to inhibit religion.
<P>
On the other hand, it would be difficult to view awarding SAF
monies to Wide Awake as anything but state sponsorship--and therefore
advancement--of religious belief. As the Constitution of Wide
Awake Productions attests, Wide Awake strives to challenge Christians
to live according to the faith they espouse, and to encourage
students at the University to consider &quot;what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2. The journal's contents--some of which are aimed at proselytizing
non-Christians--have pursued these goals indefatigably throughout
the three issues of Wide Awake represented in the record. Using
public funds to support a publication so clearly engaged in the
propagation of particular religious doctrines would constitute
a patent Establishment Clause violation. In the words of Justice
Powell:
<P>
Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing
religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is
so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed
in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious
activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.
<P>
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d
923 (1973) (emphasis added). Here, then, we hold that the primary
effect of an SAF subsidy of Wide Awake 's publication costs would
be to advance religion.
<P>
3.
<P>
It is the third of the three Lemon criteria--whether the guidelines'
prohibition of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot; fosters
an excessive government entanglement with religion--that is most
plainly implicated by this case. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct.
at 2111. The constitutional prohibition against excessive church-state
entanglement reflects James Madison's concern that secular and
religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respective
spheres of choice and influence. See III Jonathan Elliott, Debates
on the Federal Constitution 431-32, 729-31 (1891) (remarks of
James Madison); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333
U.S. 203, 212, 68 S.Ct. 461, 465-66, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948). (FN34)
The entanglement principle thus stems ultimately from fears, originally
propounded by the First Amendment's principal framer, that church-state
entanglement might strain the political system, compromise *286
liberty of conscience, and, ultimately, &quot;destroy government
and downgrade religion.&quot; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431,
82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1961); Laurence H. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law Sec. 14-11, at 1226 (2d ed. 1988)
(summarizing the import of church-state entanglement).
<P>
The indirect and incidental conferral of a government benefit
to religious institutions has never been thought a sufficient
defect to warrant the invalidation of a state policy. Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-69, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276-77, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981);
<P>
Committee for Public Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,
413 U.S. 756, 775, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2966, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973).
Indeed, the Supreme Court has sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary
benefits to religious groups where government has created open
fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited.
In Widmar, for example, the Court held that a state university
which makes its facilities available to registered student groups
may not deny equal access to a registered student group desiring
to use those facilities for religious worship or discussion. 454
U.S. at 277, 102 S.Ct. at 278. Thus, although religious groups
may directly benefit from access to university facilities, a state
university may not discriminate against them based on the content
of their speech.
<P>
Direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects,
however, is a beast of an entirely different color. A proper respect
for the Establishment Clause compels the Rector and Visitors to
pursue a course of &quot;neutrality&quot; toward religion. Yet
providing SAF monies to defray the publication costs of Wide Awake
inevitably would advance Wide Awake 's Christian mission: &quot;to
encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. The
potentially divisive political effect of such funding is a factor
of recurring significance in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence
surrounding Lemon 's &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; prong.
As Justice Black emphasized in Everson v. Board of Education,
330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), competition among
religious sects for political and religious supremacy has occasioned
considerable civil strife throughout history, &quot;generated
in large part&quot; by competing efforts to gain or maintain the
support of government. Id. at 8-9, 67 S.Ct. at 507-509. As we
see it, the &quot;potential for political divisiveness related
to religious belief and practice&quot; would be aggravated if
the University were to fund the publication of Wide Awake. The
possibility of a continuing annual appropriation for the benefit
of a single religion carries the potential for seriously divisive
political consequences at the University of Virginia. The prospect
of such divisiveness, as Justice Powell has admonished, is a &quot;warning
signal&quot; the Rector and Visitors would ignore at their, and
the University's, peril. Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 798, 93 S.Ct. at
2978.
<P>
Because Wide Awake is a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion
and advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal
philosophy, for the University to subsidize its publication would,
we believe, send an unmistakably clear signal that the University
of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote the
wide promulgation of such values. Since offering SAF funds to
the members of Wide Awake Productions would excessively entangle
the University of Virginia with the propagation of the Christian
religion, we hold that the Rector and Visitors have proved the
existence of a compelling state interest in complying with the
Establishment Clause. This compelling interest justifies the Rector
and Visitors' decision to promulgate guidelines excluding the
membership of Wide Awake Productions from access to SAF monies.
<P>
E
<P>
It remains for us to consider whether the funding guidelines'
proscription against &quot;religious activities&quot; is sufficiently
circumscribed to survive the strictest judicial scrutiny.
<P>
The Supreme Court has held that a government policy is &quot;narrowly
tailored&quot; if it &quot;targets and eliminates no more than
the exact source of the 'evil' it seeks to remedy.&quot; Frisby
v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2503, 101 L.Ed.2d
420 (1988). If *287 the guidelines' &quot;religious activities&quot;
proscription had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability
of student organizations to engage in meaningful religious expression,
the plaintiffs' contention that the proscription is not narrowly
tailored might carry considerable force. Yet it is difficult for
us to conceive how the Rector and Visitors may avoid offending
the Establishment Clause without extending the prohibition on
SAF funding to all &quot;religious activities.&quot; Because the
First Amendment forbids government to promulgate policies &quot;respecting
an establishment of religion,&quot; government is left no choice
but to foreswear financial support of the myriad forms of religious
endeavor in which a student organization might engage. Hence,
we believe that the guidelines' declaration that student organizations
involved in &quot;religious activities&quot; as that phrase is
defined (FN35) is not &quot;substantially broader than necessary&quot;
to achieve the Rector and Visitors' legitimate constitutional
ends, City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808,
104 S.Ct. 2118, 2130, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), and thus satisfies
the requirement of narrow tailoring.
<P>
F
<P>
In summary, we conclude that the Rector and Visitors' refusal
to permit funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; places a
presumptively unconstitutional condition upon access to government
benefits in violation of the Free Speech and Press Clause of the
First Amendment. We further conclude, however, that the Rector
and Visitors have shown the existence of a compelling state interest
in (1) foregoing funding awards that would have the primary effect
of advancing religion at the University of Virginia, and (2) preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion. Finally, the Rector and Visitors' restriction against
funding &quot;religious activities&quot; is narrowly tailored
to achieve this compelling state interest. Having survived the
strictest judicial scrutiny, the funding restriction cannot be
labelled constitutionally invalid under the Speech and Press Clause.
<P>
IV
<P>
The district court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the
guidelines' proscription of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause by excluding them from
the &quot;limited public forum&quot; represented by the SAF. After
careful and reasoned consideration of the governing precedents,
see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry
Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), the court concluded
that the Rector and Visitors' systematic, purposeful exclusion
of certain student groups from access to SAF funds indicated that
the Rector and Visitors intended the SAF to be a nonpublic forum.
See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 795
F.Supp. 175, 178-81 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.)
<P>
We agree that the Rector and Visitors have not created a limited
public forum by awarding SAF funds only to those student organizations
which, in the view of University authorities, advance the institution's
essentially secular educational mission although we do so for
a different reason. As laid out in part III, supra, we believe
that the proper analysis of this case lies under the line of authority
dealing with content-based discrimination relating to government-generated
benefits or burdens. The long line of public forum cases have
taken &quot;forum&quot; in a fairly literalistic way involving
physical space, and we do not see how it advances the jurisprudence
to wrench that word out of its accepted form to encompass this
type of case already subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
<P>
V
<P>
We finally turn to the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
prohibition against funding of &quot;religious activities&quot;
discriminates against them in contravention of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (1) by denying them benefits
which other CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities have
received, and (2) because the restrictions serve no compelling
state interest, *288. and are not narrowly tailored to satisfy
whatever interest the Rector and Visitors may have in denying
funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
A
<P>
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides
that no state shall &quot;deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. XIV,
Sec. 1, cl. 4. The plaintiffs contend that the Rector and Visitors
have infringed their rights under the Equal Protection Clause
by awarding SAF monies to the Muslim Students Association, the
Jewish Law Students Association, and the C.S. Lewis Society while
denying funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
To establish an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must show
discriminatory intent as well as disparate effect. See Crawford
v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3221, 73
L.Ed.2d 948 (1982);
<P>
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,
265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Washington v. Davis,
426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976);
Irby v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352, 1355 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Upon careful review of the summary judgment record,
the district court found no evidence to indicate that the University's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions was the product
of discriminatory intent. Because this finding is not contested
by the plaintiffs on appeal, we are constrained to hold that the
district court's factual findings on the point are not tainted
with clear error. Moreover, the plaintiffs' failure to argue the
existence of discriminatory intent as a matter of law on appeal
deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the merits of their equal
protection claim, and compels us to affirm the district court's
decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Rector and
Visitors.
<P>
B
<P>
For the reasons stated in part III, supra, we already have held
that the Rector and Visitors' refusal to fund &quot;religious
activities&quot; serves the compelling state interest of preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion, and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. We
therefore need not consider this question again for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Rector and Visitors' stake in avoiding
an excessive entanglement with religion is equally strong in all
constitutional contexts, including that of the Equal Protection
Clause, if, as we hold, no prima facie violation of the plaintiffs'
equal protection rights exists. This assignment of error therefore
warrants no further discussion.
<P>

<P>
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court
is hereby AFFIRMED.

FN1. See Va.Code Ann. Secs. 23-69 to -85 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993)

policies for the execution of this duty).
<P>
FN2. This case involves a challenge to the University's refusal
to fund a student organization engaged in religious expression.
Accordingly, we note that the guidelines offer definitions of
the phrases &quot;religious organization&quot; and &quot;religious
activity.&quot; A &quot;religious organization&quot; is defined
as &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; The guidelines
define a &quot;religious activity&quot; as &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;

FN4. We note that the editors of Wide Awake would reject our use
of the noun &quot;journal&quot; to describe their publication:
<P>
We ... chose to call our magazine a perspective instead of a journal
or viewpoint. The word perspective embraces the idea of viewing
a situation from a particular angle (in this case a Christian
angle), rather than viewing a situation with a particular conclusion
in mind (as a politically partisan magazine would do). Our perspective
is a starting point, not a finish line.

<P>
FN25. The guidelines draw a distinction between &quot;religious
organizations&quot; and &quot;religious activities.&quot; &quot;Religious
organizations&quot; are student groups whose whole or primary
purpose is to practice devotion to an ultimate reality or deity;
such groups are wholly barred from receiving SAF funds. &quot;Religious
activities,&quot; on the other hand, are forms of conduct or behavior
that cannot, commensurate with the guidelines, be subsidized with
SAF monies. The result of the guidelines' identification of these
two categories, however, is the total proscription of SAF funding
for all forms of religious endeavor by CIOs at the University.
<P>
When the Student Council's Appropriations Committee, and later
the Student Activities Committee, informed Ronald W. Rosenberger
that Wide Awake Productions would not be the recipient of SAF
funds, they referred to the publication of Wide Awake as a &quot;religious
activity.&quot; It has not been suggested that the defendants
rejected the funding request because Wide Awake Productions constitutes
a &quot;religious organization.&quot; Hence we assume with the
parties that the denial of funding rested on a determination that
Wide Awake was &quot;an activity ... primarily promot[ing] or
manifest[ing] a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an
ultimate reality.&quot;
<P>
FN26. The parties wrangle at considerable length over the question
whether Wide Awake Productions ever was &quot;eligible&quot; for
SAF funding at all. The plaintiffs contend that attainment of
CIO status by Wide Awake Productions made the organization &quot;eligible&quot;
to receive SAF monies. The Rector and Visitors argue that Wide
Awake Productions never was &quot;eligible&quot; for funding because
its central purpose--publication of Wide Awake--constituted a
&quot;religious activity.&quot; We need not address the merits
of these opposing positions, because we reject forthwith the Rector
and Visitors' suggestion that they be given unlimited discretion
to determine the &quot;eligibility&quot; of student groups for
SAF funding to the extent such discretion derogates the provisions
of the Bill of Rights. The duty of upholding (and therefore of
not wounding indirectly) the Federal Constitution devolves upon
the Rector and Visitors as a matter of law; as agents of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, the Rector and Visitors are bound to observe the
strictures of the First Amendment, and may not issue regulations
transgressing its bounds. As we note elsewhere herein, once SAF
funds are made available to student groups at the University,
they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
the showing of a compelling state interest.
<P>
*288_ FN27. We do not address the guidelines' prohibition of SAF
funding for such organizations as fraternities and sororities
or for such activities as social entertainment or philanthropic
contributions. Those excluded categories are not at issue in the
instant case. See supra note 2 and accompanying text.
<P>
FN28. In defense of their position, the Rector and Visitors cite
a number of recent decisions by the Supreme Court; without exception,
none of these cases are relevant to the question before us, and
we find it unnecessary to discuss them at length. For thoroughness'
sake, however, we observe that Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), on which the Rector and
Visitors lay great emphasis, did not involve the erection of a
prior restraint on abortion counseling by recipients of family
planning funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act,
42 U.S.C. Secs. 300 to 330a-6a. In Rust, regulations issued by
the Secretary of Health and Human Services simply limited the
ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related
expressive activities. Id. at 176-77, 111 S.Ct. at 1764. Although,
like the SAF funding restrictions at issue here, the regulations
broadly prohibited Title X projects from engaging in activities
that &quot;encourage[d], promote[d] or advocate[d] abortion as
a method of family planning,&quot; id. at 180, 111 S.Ct. at 1765,
there was no question that the recipients were recipients--that
is, that they already had received Title X funding. In his opinion
for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized this distinction:
<P>
Petitioners' reliance on [the Court's &quot;unconstitutional conditions&quot;
cases] is unavailing ... because here the government is not denying
a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public
funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.
<P>
Id. at 196, 111 S.Ct. at 1774. Thus, the issue in Rust was not--as
here--whether the recipients could obtain access to government
benefits. It was, instead, whether the government could be allowed
to dictate the use to which already-allocated funds could be dedicated.
<P>

FN30. As we are well-aware, the Supreme Court's applications of
Lemon have been characterized by fine distinctions, and have aroused
considerable controversy among the Justices themselves, even to
the point of frequent suggestion in nonmajority opinions that
Lemon be abandoned. We note, for example, Justice Scalia's recent
denunciation of Lemon:
<P>
Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits
up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed
and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence
once again, frightening the little children....

Nevertheless, &quot;Lemon, however frightening it might be to
some, has not been overruled.&quot; Lamb's Chapel, --- U.S. at

decisions of the Supreme Court, not the pronouncements of a single
Justice or even of a pair of Justices in dissent.
<P>
As Justice Powell has stated, the three-pronged Lemon test ...
is the only coherent [Establishment Clause] test a majority of
the Court has ever adopted.... Lemon has never been overruled
or its test modified.
<P>
Jaffree, 472 U.S. at 64, 105 S.Ct. at 2494 (Powell, J., concurring)

Clause question presented here, therefore, we are bound to consider
Lemon governing precedent.
<P>
*288_ FN31. We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme
Court's decision in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1,
109 S.Ct. 890, 103 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (plurality opinion), controls
our analysis of the Establishment Clause issue presented by this
case, and obviates the need to examine the guidelines' restrictions
in light of Lemon v. Kurtzman. Texas Monthly involved a state
sales tax exemption for &quot;[p]eriodicals that are published
or distributed by a religious faith and that consist wholly of
writings sacred to a religious faith.&quot; Texas Monthly, 489
U.S. at 5, 109 S.Ct. at 894. The Court held that the exemption
was insufficiently broad--that is, that it did not reach an adequately
wide class of publications--to pass Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
If Texas Monthly has application in the instant case, it is only
as an extra pillar for our initial, but not dispositive, holding
that the SAF guidelines' &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; prohibition
has erected a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on
the receipt of a government benefit. In his opinion for a three-Justice
plurality, Justice Brennan stated:
<P>
[W]hen government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations
that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause and that either
burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen
as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to free exercise
of religion ..., it &quot;provide[s] unjustifiable awards of assistance
to religious organizations&quot; and cannot but &quot;conve[y]
a message of endorsement&quot; to slighted members of the community.
This is particularly clear where, as here, the subsidy is targeted
at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.
<P>
Id. at 15, 109 S.Ct. at 899 (quoting Corporation of Presiding
Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2874-75, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). As we explain below,
an award of SAF funds to defray publication costs of Wide Awake
would &quot;convey a message of endorsement&quot; of Christianity
to non-Christian members of the University of Virginia community.
&quot;This is particularly clear,&quot; id., because, as we observe,
such a subsidy would be targeted at a publication whose purpose
is &quot;to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means,&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2--a goal plainly contemplating the &quot;promulgat[ion]&quot;
of Christian teachings.
<P>
That Texas Monthly supports one wing of our analysis does not,
however, release us from the obligation of testing the Rector
and Visitors' asserted state interest in complying with the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, Justice Brennan's opinion addressed Texas's Establishment
Clause defense of its sales tax exemption by holding that the
exemption lacked sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under Lemon.
See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 8-17, 109 S.Ct. at 895-901. Because
this case involves a direct governmental subsidy of religious
expression rather than a mere exemption from the payment of duties,
it is not directly on point with Texas Monthly.

federal grants in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
MICHAEL, District Judge.
<P>
In this case, the court is asked to resolve the difficult question
of whether a &quot;student activities fund,&quot; comprised of
mandatory student fees, constitutes a limited public forum. For
the reasons set forth below, *177 the court concludes that the
answer to this riddle is &quot;no.&quot;
<P>
I.
<P>
In September of 1990, plaintiff Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate
student at the University of Virginia (the University), joined
with other University students to form Wide Awake Productions
(WAP). WAP is an unincorporated association officially recognized
by the University as a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO).
This recognition is given to all student organizations which execute
an annual agreement with the University and meet certain minimal
requirements. (FN1) The benefit of becoming a CIO is that such
organizations are given access to University facilities; i.e.
meeting rooms, computer terminals, etc.
<P>
WAP publishes Wide Awake Magazine (Wide Awake), a non-profit journal
written, edited and published by the student members of WAP. Mr.
Rosenberger serves as the magazine's publisher, while other named
plaintiffs include members of the management and editorial staff.
To date, three issues of Wide Awake have been published, with
approximately 5,000 copies of each issue distributed free of charge
to students on the University campus.
<P>
In January of 1991, WAP submitted an application for funding from
the University in the amount of $5,862.00 to offset the cost of
publishing its magazine. Specifically, WAP sought funding from
monies deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (SAF).
The SAF is funded by a mandatory student activities fee collected
from every full-time student at the University. The activity fee
is designed to provide financial support for student organizations
related to the educational purposes of the University.
<P>
The defendants in this action, the Rector and Board of Visitors
of the University (the Board) (FN2) have ultimate responsibility
for the operation of the SAF. The Board has delegated the responsibility
of allocating SAF funds to the University's Student Council. The
Student Council disburses SAF funds to those CIOs deemed eligible
for funding as determined by Guidelines issued by the Board. These
Guidelines prohibit several categories of student organizations
from obtaining SAF funds. Ineligible groups include fraternities
and sororities, political and religious organizations, and those
groups whose membership is exclusionary in nature. Further, the
following expenditures and activities are also excluded by the
Guidelines: (1) honoraria or similar fees;
<P>
(2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment or related
expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities; and
(5) political activities.
<P>
A CIO seeking SAF monies must first submit a request for funding
to the Student Council Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council. As noted earlier, WAP made its first
and only request for funding in January of 1991. The Chairman
of the Student Council denied the funding request because the
Appropriations Committee determined that publication of Wide Awake
constituted a &quot;religious activity.&quot; (FN3) WAP appealed
this decision to the full Student Council, which affirmed the
appropriation Committee's denial of funding. WAP pursued all internal
means of appeal before filing suit in this court on July 11, 1991.
The plaintiffs allege that the denial of SAF benefits violates
*178 their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom
of association, free exercise of religion, and equal protection
of the laws in violation of the United States Constitution, the
Virginia Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.
Plaintiffs have also set forth a cause of action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983.
<P>
On November 12, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
judgment, asking this court for a declaratory judgment that the
defendants had indeed violated the plaintiff's constitutional
rights. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment
and both sides appeared before this court for oral argument on
these motions. Both sides agree, with minor exceptions addressed
herein, that there are no genuine issues of material fact in conflict.
Thus, this matter is ripe for disposition. (FN4)
<P>
II. The Freedom of Speech Claims
<P>
The preliminary question for this court to resolve is whether
the University's SAF qualifies as a &quot;limited public forum&quot;
as the plaintiffs assert, or whether the SAF is in fact a &quot;non-public&quot;
forum, as the defendants argue. This determination is crucial
as it dictates the degree of scrutiny to be used by this court
in reviewing the Board of Visitor Guidelines. (FN5) See Perry
Educ. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (&quot;The existence
of a right of access to public property and the standard by which
limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending
on the character of the property at issue.&quot;) See also Cornelius
v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S.
788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (&quot;the
extent to which the Government may limit access [to a forum] depends
on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.&quot;)
<P>
The phrase &quot;limited public forum&quot; describes one of three
categories of fora identified by the Supreme Court in Perry, supra.
(FN6) A limited public forum is property &quot;which the State
has opened for use by the public even if it was not required to
create the forum in the first place.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at
45, 103 S.Ct. at 955 citing Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102
S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). A state may only restrict access
to limited public fora if such a restriction is narrowly drawn
to effectuate a compelling state interest.
<P>
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. A different category
of property consists of public property which is not &quot;by
tradition or designation a forum for public communication.&quot;
Id. Not surprisingly, this type of property is labeled &quot;nonpublic.&quot;
Access to such a forum can be limited by restrictions which are
&quot; 'reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression
merely because the public officials oppose the speaker's view.'
&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 800, 105 S.Ct. at 3448 quoting Perry,
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
<P>
It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that the label
affixed to the University's SAF (either limited public forum or
nonpublic forum) will have a rather profound impact on whether
the Board's Guidelines will be upheld by this court. The plaintiffs
rely heavily on Gay and Lesbian Students Assn. v. Gohn, 850 F.2d
361 (8th Cir.1988) for the proposition that &quot;compulsory student
activities fees&quot; constitute a limited public forum. In Gohn,
the Gay and Lesbian Students Association (GLSA) at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville challenged the decision of the Student
Senate denying funding to the *179 group. The money was to be
paid out of funds from &quot;tuition, state tax money, and general
fees collected from students.&quot; Id. at 361. In finding that
the denial of funding violated GLSA's First Amendment rights,
the court stated:
<P>
we hold that a public body that chooses to fund speech or expression
must do so even-handedly, without discriminating among recipients
on the basis of their ideology. The University need not supply
funds to student organizations; but once having decided to do
so, it is bound by the First Amendment to act without regard to
the content of the ideas being expressed.
<P>
Id. at 362.
<P>
This court does not read Gohn at holding that a student activities
fund is a limited public forum. Gohn merely stands for the proposition
that  content-based discrimination can be justified only if the
government demonstrates that its regulation is narrowly drawn
and is necessary to effectuate compelling state interests.&quot;
Id. at 367 citing Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270, 102 S.Ct. at 274. The
plaintiffs read this citation to Widmar and the mention of a &quot;compelling
state interest&quot; as a signal that the Eighth Circuit considered
the student activity fee as creating a limited public forum, thus
requiring the use of a heightened level of scrutiny. This reading
of Gohn stretches the Eighth Circuit's opinion beyond the breaking
point.
<P>
The mere mention of heightened scrutiny does not in and of itself
indicate that the court is dealing with either a traditional or
a limited public forum.
<P>
Heightened scrutiny can also be applied even if the forum is characterized
as nonpublic. The Supreme Court recognized this in Perry by stating:
<P>
Public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum
for public communication is governed by different standards. We
have recognized that the 'First Amendment does not guarantee access
to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.'
In addition to time, place, and manner regulations, the State
may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative
or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable
and not an effort to suppress expression merely because the public
officials oppose the speaker's view.
<P>
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955 (citations omitted).
<P>
This passage from Perry indicates that viewpoint discrimination
will rarely be tolerated, regardless of whether the restriction
applies to public, limited or nonpublic fora. Further, a careful
reading of Gohn indicates that the Eighth Circuit considered the
student service funds as creating a nonpublic forum. Specifically,
the court noted that:
<P>
We realize that the District Court made no explicit finding as
to the reason for denial of funding, that this is a question of
fact, and that appellate courts are not fact-finding forums. We
think, though, that the District Court's opinion, when read in
full and in context, includes an implicit finding that funds were
denied because of distaste for the GLSA's ideas. Otherwise, there
would have been no need to resort to the legal doctrines (e.g.
that there is no &quot;right&quot; to public money) used by the
Court to justify dismissing the complaint. A finding of fact that
funds were denied for some content-neutral reason would have sufficed
completely to dispose of the case. In any event, the facts of
this case are so obvious that a remand for an explicit finding
would be a waste of time. This record leaves no reasonable doubt
that funds were denied because of disagreement with GLSA's speech.
(emphasis added).
<P>
Gohn, 850 F.2d at 367. Here, the court indicates that GLSA would
have lost its case had the University of Arkansas put forth a
content neutral reason for denying funding. This is not the standard
used in limited public forum cases, but instead is the standard
used in nonpublic forum situations.
<P>
This court also looks to Cornelius, supra for guidance as to whether
the SAF qualifies as a public forum. Here, the Supreme Court began
its forum analysis by *180 noting that, &quot;[t]he government
does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited
discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional
forum for public discourse.&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802,
105 S.Ct. at 3449 citing Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
(emphasis added). In Cornelius, the Supreme Court held that the
Federal Government could exclude legal defense and political advocacy
organizations from participation in the Combined Federal Campaign
(CFC), a charity drive directed at federal employees. The Court
held that the campaign was a nonpublic forum because:
<P>
[t]he Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation
in the CFC to &quot;appropriate&quot; voluntary agencies and to
require agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal
and local Campaign officials ... The Civil Service Commission
and, after 1978, the Office of Personnel Management developed
extensive criteria to limit access to the Campaign to those organization
considered appropriate. Such selective access, unsupported by
evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not
create a public forum.
<P>
Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 804-5, 105 S.Ct. at 3450 (citations omitted).
<P>
In the present situation, the University has limited eligibility
for SAF monies to those organizations deemed &quot;appropriate.&quot;
Religious organizations are but one of several groups excluded
from participation in the SAF because the Board of Visitors has
decided that such groups do not further the educational purposes
of the University. This exclusion of religious groups and religious
activities has been in effect since the establishment of the Guidelines
in 1970, and has survived revisions in 1973, 1978, 1980 and 1991.

<P>
The plaintiffs attempt to counter this fact by arguing that &quot;the
defendants created the SAF mechanism to encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints among students at the University of
Virginia in furtherance of the educational mission of the University.&quot;
In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs direct the court
to the page 1 of the Guidelines. The Guidelines, in pertinent
part, read as follows:
<P>
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
This court does not read this passage to indicate a desire on
the part of the Board of Visitors to &quot;encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints.&quot; Rather, the Guidelines suggest
that the SAF was established to fund only those CIOs whose activities
contributed to the educational focus of the University. The Board
of Visitors has not opened the SAF coffers to all CIOs; (FN7)
some groups, such as WAP, were excluded simply because the Board
of Visitors determined that their activities were not consistent
with the goals of the University. The consistent, purposeful exclusion
of certain groups indicates that the SAF is indeed a nonpublic
forum.
<P>
This conclusion is further supported by the Supreme Court's reasoning
in Perry, supra. The forum in Perry consisted of an interschool
mailing system used to facilitate communication between various
teachers. A teacher's union challenged the local Board of Education's
decision denying the union access to the system. The plaintiff
union argued that the school mail facilities became a limited
public forum because other private, non-school-connected groups
had previously been given access to the system. Perry, 460 U.S.
at 47, 103 S.Ct.
<P>
at 956. In rejecting this contention, the Court stated:
<P>
The use of the internal school mail by groups not affiliated with
the schools is no doubt a relevant consideration. If by policy
or by practice the Perry School *181 District has opened its mail
system for indiscriminate use by the general public, then PLEA
could justifiably argue a public forum has been created. This,
however, is not the case. As the case comes before us, there is
no indication in the record that the school mailboxes and interschool
delivery system are open for use by the general public. Permission
to use the system to communicate with teachers must be secured
from the individual building principal. There is no court finding
or evidence in the record which demonstrates that this permission
has been granted as a matter of course to all who seek to distribute
material. We can only conclude that the schools do allow some
outside organizations such as the YMCA, Cub Scouts, and other
civic and church organizations to use the facilities. This type
of selective access does not transform government property into
a public forum.
<P>
Id.
<P>
Similarly, the fact that the University has given certain CIOs
access to SAF funds does not lead to the conclusion that such
selective access transforms the SAF into a limited public forum.
<P>
Finally, the plaintiffs reliance on Widmar is misplaced. The present
case might very well be resolved in plaintiffs favor if the University
had denied CIO status to WAP. The defendants themselves take the
position that access to certification as a CIO is a limited public
forum. This is because only CIO's have access to University facilities.
(FN8) This is a far cry from the present situation and is the
reason why this court finds Widmar factually distinguishable from
the case at hand.
<P>
Having concluded that the SAF is a nonpublic forum, this court
must now determine whether the Board's Guidelines constitute restrictions
which are &quot;reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression
merely because public officials oppose the speaker' views.&quot;
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. The defendants offer
two basic rationales for excluding religious organizations such
as WAP from SAF eligibility. First, the University has only limited
funds to disburse and must therefore limit funding to those activities
which it determines advance its educational mission. Second, the
ineligibility of religious organizations and activities is justified
based on the Federal and State constitutional mandate of state
neutrality toward religion.
<P>
Although fiscal restraints are pertinent, this court may resolve
the reasonableness of the Guidelines by reference to the University's
second proffered reason. The parties devote considerable time
in their respective briefs addressing the obvious Establishment
Clause issues raised in this case. However, this court need not
resolve this issue on the facts of this case. For even if the
plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that funding Wide Awake
would not violate Federal or State law, it is not the province
of this court to second guess the legal judgments made by the
University. So long as the University's Establishment Clause fears
are reasonable, the Guideline restriction must stand. Given the
complexity of the law in this regard, this court has little trouble
in finding that the Guideline restriction is a reasonable limit
to access to SAF funds. Further, the restriction is a reasonable
response by the University to prevent excessive entanglement with
religion.
<P>
The court also finds that the Guideline limitations do not result
in viewpoint discrimination against religious organizations such
as WAP. The plaintiffs seem to argue that any across the board
restriction applied to a religious group results in content based
discrimination. This may be *182 true in the abstract, but this
court, and the University, must live in the real world. It could
be argued that every decision by the University results in viewpoint
discrimination. On this point, the court finds Justice Stevens'
comments in his concurring opinion in Widmar to be highly relevant.
Justice Stevens states that:
<P>
In performing their learning and teaching missions, the managers
of a university routinely make countless decisions based on the
content of communicative materials. They select books for inclusion
in the library, they hire professors on the basis of their academic
philosophies, they select courses for inclusion in the curriculum,
and they reward scholars for what they have written. In addition,
in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities,
they necessarily make decisions concerning the content of those
activities.
<P>
Widmar, 454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278.
<P>
In brief, the plaintiffs' complaints about the Guidelines are
more properly directed at the wisdom and not the legality of the
restrictions. This is because the court finds, as a matter of
law, that the Board's Guidelines are reasonable and do not violate
any of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. (FN9)
<P>
III. The Free Exercise of Religion Claims
<P>
The heart of the plaintiffs' claim is that without SAF monies
WAP must devote more time to fund raising and less time to publishing
its religious speech. Thus, the denial of funding burdens the
plaintiffs' free exercise of religion by diverting energy away
from WAP's main goal: challenging Christians to live according
to their faith.
<P>
Both sides agree that this court's analysis should begin with
Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389 (4th Cir.) cert.
denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 131, 112 L.Ed.2d 99 (1990). Here,
the Fourth Circuit stated that in reviewing a free exercise claim,
a court should:
<P>
... examine the burden on the exercise of ... [plaintiff's] sincerely
held religious beliefs, then determine whether the state presents
a compelling justification for imposing this burden, and finally
balancing the burden on free exercise against the state's ...
[compelling interest].
<P>
Id. at 1397.
<P>
In the present case, it is difficult for this court to identify
any burden of constitutional magnitude that has been imposed on
the plaintiffs. It is logical to assume that publishing a magazine
is easier if someone else pays the bills. However, if this incidental
burden was of constitutional significance, the free exercise clause
would be implicated in every funding decision involving a religious
organization. A review of the record indicates that WAP is unable
to point to any facts making their burden unique from other CIOs
which have been denied SAF monies. Political groups and fraternities
and sororities share a common plight with WAP: none of these groups
is eligible for funding. The only distinguishing factor is that
WAP engages in religious activity. However, WAP has not cited
this court to any authority indicating that religious organizations
should receive preferential access to a nonpublic forum.
<P>
The plaintiffs' attempt to bridge this gap in their argument by
asserting that &quot;freedom of expression may not be infringed
by denying a privilege.&quot;
<P>
WAP relies on Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct.
1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) to support this position. This
court does not read Sherbert as broadly as do the plaintiffs.
In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S.
872, 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1602, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), the Court
stated that, &quot;[u]nder the Sherbert test, governmental actions
that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest.&quot; (emphasis added).
This language *183 itself indicates that a burden must be substantial
before the court will consider whether the state has a compelling
reason for the restriction. (FN10) The Fourth Circuit appears
to have adopted this position in Goodall v. Stafford County School
Board, 930 F.2d 363 (4th Cir.) cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 188, 116 L.Ed.2d 149 (1991). Here the court stated that
[w]here the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon
conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such
a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby
putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior
and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While
the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise
is nonetheless substantial.
<P>
Goodall, 930 F.2d at 369 quoting Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana
Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct.
1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). (FN11)
<P>
Even if this court were to consider the Board's Guidelines as
imposing a burden on WAP's free exercise of religion, WAP is still
bound by the Fourth Circuit's holding in Goodall, supra, that
avoidance of a violation of the Establishment Clause constitutes
a compelling state interest. Goodall, 930 F.2d at 370. Further,
balancing the minimal burden on the plaintiffs with the defendants
rationale for the Guidelines indicates that the scale must come
down in favor of the defendants.
<P>
IV. The Equal Protection Claims
<P>
The last issue for the court to resolve in the plaintiffs' claims
that the Guidelines have been applied in less than an even-handed
manner. Put somewhat differently, the plaintiffs contend that
they have been denied equal protection of the laws because other
&quot;religious groups&quot; have been given SAF monies. As evidence
of this unequal treatment, WAP focuses on the funding decisions
make with respect to other CIOs.
<P>
The defendants seek to counter this argument by citing this court
to Irby v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Irby stands for the proposition that a plaintiff challenging
a facially neutral statute with an equal protection claim must
show not only disparate effect, but also discriminatory intent.
Thus, the defendants do not argue that the Student Council's funding
decisions are always correct. Instead, the defendants argue that
there is no evidence to suggest that the Student Council's decision
to deny funding to WAP resulted from discriminatory intent.
<P>
In their reply brief, the plaintiffs do not dispute the defendants
statement of the law nor the facts on this issue. The court has
reviewed the entire record independently, and cannot find any
evidence to indicate that the decision to deny funding to WAP
was based on discriminatory intent. Accordingly, summary judgment
in favor of the defendants is appropriate.
<P>
In summary, the court holds that access to the SAF is a nonpublic
forum upon which the University has imposed reasonable restrictions.
These restrictions do not impose an impermissible burden on the
plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by either the
Federal or State Constitutions, or the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom. Thus, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and grants the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.
An appropriate order shall this day issue.
<P>
ORDER
<P>
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum opinion,
it is hereby *184.
<P>
ADJUDGED AND ORDERED
<P>
that:
<P>
1. The plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied;
<P>
2. The defendants' cross motion for summary judgment is granted.
<P>
This case shall be dismissed and stricken from the docket of the
court. The Clerk of the Court is hereby directed to send a certified
copy of this Order to all counsel of record.
<P>
FN1. There are four general criteria for CIO status: (1) at least
fifty-one percent of the group's members must be students; (2)
the group's officers must all be full-time, fee-paying students;
(3) the group must keep an updated copy of its constitution on
file with the University; and (4) the group must sign an anti-discrimination
disclaimer.
<P>
FN2. The individual Board members and Mr. Robert Stump, Associate
Dean of Students, are named defendants and are being sued in their
official capacities.
<P>
FN3. Mr. Rosenberger admits that Wide Awake is written from a
&quot;religious perspective.&quot; Further, Article 1 of WAP's
constitution states that the purpose of the organization is to:
(1) publish a magazine of philosophical and religious expressions;
(2) facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity
to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints; and (3) provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.
<P>
FN4. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs'
claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the grounds that
such a claim is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United
States Constitution. The court need not address this issue as
it has determined that all of the plaintiffs' claims must fail,
as a matter of law.
<P>
FN5. The plaintiffs have launched a general assault on the propriety
of certain exclusions in the Guidelines; i.e. those prohibiting
the funding of religious organizations and activities. Alternatively,
the plaintiffs set forth an equal protection claim by arguing
that the Guidelines have not been applied in an even-handed manner.
The court will address the equal protection issue in part IV of
this opinion.
<P>
FN6. The plaintiffs do not argue that the SAF is a traditional
public forum.
<P>
FN7. For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations
qualified as CIOs. Of these 135 applied for SAF funds and 118
were actually allotted SAF monies.
<P>
FN8. The plaintiffs allege that they have been denied access to
certain University facilities yet have presented no evidence,
beyond Mr. Rosenberger's affidavit, to support of this claim.
For instance, there is no assertion that WAP has even attempted
to use University facilities or computers. The defendants have
submitted the affidavit of Mr. Stump, who swears that &quot;[a]s
a CIO, Wide Awake has been and is accorded the same access and
use of University facilities as other CIOs.&quot; The court has
considered this conflicting evidence in the light most favorable
to the plaintiffs, but comes to the conclusion that WAP has not
raised a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue.
<P>
FN9. In their briefs and in oral argument, the parties did not
separately address plaintiffs' claims under Federal and State
law. Although the court has focused on Federal Constitutional
law, the preceding analysis applies to the plaintiffs' claims
based on the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom.
<P>
FN10. The court notes that the plaintiffs have not identified
a religious practice which is infringed by the Board's Guidelines.
Apparently the plaintiffs contend that publishing a religious
magazine is itself a religious practice.
<P>
FN11. The court also notes that with few exceptions, Sherbert
has been limited to those cases involving the denial of unemployment
compensation benefits. See Smith, supra, 494 U.S. at 883, 110
S.Ct. at 1602.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated
association of individuals elected from various veterans groups,
was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the
St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a
place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed
for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express
its members' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian,
and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals
in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought
to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB and some
of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the
denial of their application to march violated, inter alia, a state
law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation
in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation
and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial
court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common
theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that,
given the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants
and its failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade
lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein
would not violate the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.
<P>
Held: The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public
accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a
parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message
that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment.
Pp. 2343-2351.
<P>
(a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual
characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm
of non-expressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty
to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole,
without deference to those courts, to assure that *2340 their
judgment does not constitute a forbidden
<P>
intrusion on the field of free expression. See, e.g., New York
Times Co. v.
<P>
Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.
Pp.
<P>
2343-2345.
<P>
(b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled
to First Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are
a form of protected expression because they include marchers who
are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other
but to bystanders along the way. Cf., e.g., Gregory v. Chicago,
394 U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 946, 22 L.Ed.2d 134. Moreover,
such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs,
but extends to symbolic acts. See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182,
1187, 87 L.Ed. 1628. Although the Council has been rather lenient
in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does
not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious
voices, by failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific
message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech, or by failing
to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the
communication. Thus, petitioners are entitled to protection under
the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade
was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate
its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 2345-2346.
<P>
(c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within
a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that
a given group is being discriminated against. And the statute
does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis
of its content. Pp. 2346-2347.
<P>
(d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of
declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.
Since every participating parade unit affects the message conveyed
by the private organizers, the state courts' peculiar application
of the Massachusetts law essentially forced the Council to alter
the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental
First Amendment rule that a speaker has the autonomy to choose
the content of his own message and, conversely, to decide what
not to say. Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle
is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the
parade from potential participants and clearly decided to exclude
a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make,
and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to
shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining
silent on another, free from state interference. The constitutional
violation is not saved by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497. The Council
is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of individual,
unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for
individual selection by members of the audience; and there is
no assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the
absence of the Massachusetts law. Nor has any other legitimate
interest been identified in support of applying that law in the
way done by the state courts to expressive activity like the parade.

<P>
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston. As
early as 1737, some people in Boston observed the feast of the
apostle to Ireland, and since 1776 the day has marked the evacuation
of royal troops and Loyalists from the city, prompted by the guns
captured at Ticonderoga and set up on Dorchester Heights under
General Washington's command. Washington himself reportedly drew
on the earlier tradition in choosing &quot;St. Patrick&quot; as
the response to &quot;Boston,&quot; the password used in the colonial
lines on evacuation day. See J. Crimmins, St. Patrick's Day: Its
Celebration in New York and other American Places, 1737-1845,
pp. 15, 19 (1902); see generally 1 H.S. Commager &amp; R. Morris,
The Spirit of 'Seventy Six 138-183 (1958); The American Book of
Days 262-265 (J. Hatch ed., 3d ed. 1978). Although the General
Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as
Evacuation Day until 1938, see Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 6:12K (1992),
the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored public celebrations
of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial
in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in 1901, with its parade,
salute, concert, and fireworks display. See Celebration of the
Centennial Anniversary of the Evacuation of Boston by the British
Army (G. Ellis ed. 1876); Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston v. City of Boston et al., Civ.Action No. 92-1516
(Super.Ct., Mass., Dec. 15, 1993), reprinted in App. to Pet. for
Cert. B1, B8-B9.
<P>
The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end
in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted
authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation
Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans
Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected
from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that
time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for the
parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers
and drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever
applied for that permit. Id., at B9. Through 1992, the city allowed
the Council to use the city's official seal, and provided printing
services as well as direct funding.
<P>
1992 was the year that a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual
descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other
supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march
in the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage
as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate
that there are such men and women among those so descended, and
to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to
march in New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Id., at B3; App.
51. Although the Council denied GLIB's application to take part
in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include
its contingent, which marched &quot;uneventfully&quot; among that
year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet.
for Cert. B3, and n. 4.
<P>
In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to
the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its members
filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner
John J. &quot;Wacko&quot; Hurley, and the City of Boston, alleging
violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state
public accommodations law, which prohibits &quot;any distinction,
discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation
... relative to the admission of any person to, or treatment in
any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. After finding that &quot;[f]or at least
the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route
along the public streets of South Boston, providing entertainment,
amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,&quot;
App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that
the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation,
which includes &quot;any place ... which is open to and accepts
or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting
*2342 the generality of this definition, whether or not it be
... (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] ... (8) a place
of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:92A. The court found that the Council had
no written criteria and employed no particular procedures for
admission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally
admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade without having
submitted an application, and did &quot;not generally inquire
into the specific messages or views of each applicant.&quot; App.
to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council's
contention that the parade was &quot;private&quot; (in the sense
of being exclusive), holding instead that &quot;the lack of genuine
selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates
that the Parade is a public event.&quot; Id., at B6. It found
the parade to be &quot;eclectic,&quot; containing a wide variety
of &quot;patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious,
athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes,&quot;
as well as conflicting messages. Id., at B24. While noting that
the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an
antibusing group), id., at B7, it attributed little significance
to these facts, concluding ultimately that &quot;[t]he only common
theme among the participants and sponsors is their public involvement
in the Parade,&quot; id., at B24.
<P>
The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion
of &quot;groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the fact]
that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values,&quot;
id., at B3, and found the Council's &quot;final position [to be]
that GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message,
i.e., its members' sexual orientation,&quot; id., at B4, n. 5,
citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993). This position,
in the court's view, was not only violative of the public accommodations
law but &quot;paradoxical&quot; as well, since &quot;a proper
celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity
and inclusiveness.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. B24. The court
rejected the notion that GLIB's admission would trample on the
Council's First Amendment rights since the court understood that
constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association
would &quot;requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group&quot;
absent from the parade. Ibid. &quot;Given the [Council's] lack
of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to circumscribe
the marchers' message,&quot; the court found it &quot;impossible
to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade
to protection under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at B25. It
concluded that the parade is &quot;not an exercise of [the Council's]
constitutionally protected right of expressive association,&quot;
but instead &quot;an open recreational event that is subject to
the public accommodations law.&quot; Id., at B27.
<P>
The court held that because the statute did not mandate inclusion
of GLIB but only prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation,
any infringement on the Council's right to expressive association
was only &quot;incidental&quot; and &quot;no greater than necessary
to accomplish the statute's legitimate purpose&quot; of eradicating
discrimination. Id., at B25, citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U.S. 609, 628-629, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255-3256, 82 L.Ed.2d 462
(1984). Accordingly, it ruled that &quot;GLIB is entitled to participate
in the Parade on the same terms and conditions as other participants.&quot;
Id., at B27. (FN1)
<P>
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, seeing nothing
clearly erroneous in the trial judge's findings that GLIB was
excluded from the parade based on the sexual orientation of its
members, that it was impossible to detect an expressive purpose
in the parade, that there was no state action, and that the parade
was a public accommodation within the meaning of Sec. 272:92A.
<P>
Irish- *2343 American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston
v. Boston, 418 Mass. 238, 242-248, 636 N.E.2d 1293, 1295-1298
(1994). (FN2) Turning to petitioners' First Amendment claim that
application of the public accommodations law to the parade violated
their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to
expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court's
majority held that it need not decide on the particular First
Amendment theory involved &quot;because, as the [trial] judge
found, it is 'impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose
entitling the parade to protection under the First Amendment.'
&quot; Id., at 249, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299 (footnote omitted). The
defendants had thus failed at the trial level &quot;to demonstrate
that the parade truly was an exercise of ... First Amendment rights,&quot;
id., at 250, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299, citing Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293, n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065,
3069, n. 5, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated
to the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial judge's
assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly erroneous,
ibid. The court rejected petitioners' further challenge to the
law as overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate
speech, does not let public officials examine the content of speech,
and would not be interpreted as reaching speech. Id., at 251-252,
636 N.E.2d, at 1300. Finally, the court rejected the challenge
that the public accommodations law was unconstitutionally vague,
holding that this case did not present an issue of speech and
that the law gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what was prohibited. Id., at 252, 636 N.E.2d,
at 1300-1301.
<P>
Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council &quot;does not
need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it
to be protected under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at 256,
636 N.E.2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the parade had no
message at all, GLIB's particular message could not be forced
upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303, citing Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977)
(state requirement to display &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; on
license plates violates First Amendment). Second, according to
Justice Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade
devoid of expressive purpose. Ibid. He would have held that the
Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from
excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes
to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303-1304, citing
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). Under either a pure speech or associational
theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could be
achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission
of individuals regardless of sexual preference, without taking
the further step of prohibiting the Council from editing the views
expressed in their parade. Id., at 256, 258, 636 N.E.2d, at 1302,
1304. In Justice Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable
from the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate
the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the
Council's First Amendment rights. Finally, he found clear error
in the trial judge's equation of exclusion on the basis of GLIB's
message with exclusion on the basis of its members' sexual orientation.
To the dissent this appeared false in the light of &quot;overwhelming
evidence&quot; that the Council objected to GLIB on account of
its message and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating
that sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260,
636 N.E.2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the
Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations
law.
<P>
We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to
admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private
organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U.S.
----, 115 S.Ct. 714, 130 L.Ed.2d 621 (1995). We hold that it does
and reverse.

<P>
Given the scope of the issues as originally joined in this case,
it is worth noting some that have fallen aside in the course of
the litigation, before
<P>
reaching us. Although the Council presents us with a First Amendment
claim, respondents do not. Neither do they press a claim that
the Council's action has denied them equal protection of the laws
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the guarantees
of free speech and equal protection guard only against encroachment
by the government and &quot;erec[t] no shield against merely private
conduct,&quot; Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836,
842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507,
513, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 1033, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), respondents originally
argued that the Council's conduct was not purely private, but
had the character of state action. The trial court's review of
the city's involvement led it to find otherwise, however, and
although the Supreme Judicial Court did not squarely address the
issue, it appears to have affirmed the trial court's decision
on that point as well as the others. In any event, respondents
have not brought that question up either in a cross-petition for
certiorari or in their briefs filed in this Court. When asked
at oral argument whether they challenged the conclusion by the
Massachusetts' courts that no state action is involved in the
parade, respondents' counsel answered that they &quot;do not press
that issue here.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. In this Court, then,
their claim for inclusion in the parade rests solely on the Massachusetts
public accommodations law.
<P>
There is no corresponding concession from the other side, however,
and certainly not to the state courts' characterization of the
parade as lacking the element of expression for purposes of the
First Amendment. Accordingly, our review of petitioners' claim
that their activity is indeed in the nature of protected speech
carries with it a constitutional duty to conduct an independent
examination of the record as a whole, without deference to the
trial court. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1958, 80 L.Ed.2d 502
(1984). The &quot;requirement of independent appellate review
... is a rule of federal constitutional law,&quot; id., at 510,
104 S.Ct., at 1965, which does not limit our deference to a trial
court on matters of witness credibility, Harte-Hanks Communications,
Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2696,
105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989), but which generally requires us to &quot;review
the finding of facts by a State court ... where a conclusion of
law as to a Federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled
as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the Federal question,
to analyze the facts,&quot; Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380, 385-386,
47 S.Ct. 655, 656-657, 71 L.Ed. 1108 (1927). See also Niemotko
v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 271, 71 S.Ct. 325, 327, 95 L.Ed. 267
(1951); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 189, 84 S.Ct. 1676,
1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (opinion of Brennan, J.). This obligation
rests upon us simply because the reaches of the First Amendment
are ultimately defined by the facts it is held to embrace, and
we must thus decide for ourselves whether a given course of conduct
falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.
See Bose Corp., supra, at 503, 104 S.Ct. at 1961. Even where a
speech case has originally been tried in a federal court, subject
to the provision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) that
&quot;[f]indings of fact ... shall not be set aside unless clearly
erroneous,&quot; we are obliged to make a fresh examination of
crucial facts. Hence, in this case, though we are confronted with
the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics
of petitioners' activity place it within the vast realm of non-expressive
conduct, our obligation is to &quot; 'make an independent examination
of the whole record,' ... so as to assure ourselves that th[is]
judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field
of free expression.&quot; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (footnote
omitted), quoting Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235,
83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963).

If there were no reason for a group of people to march from here
to there except to *2345 reach a destination, they could make
the trip without expressing any message beyond the fact of the
march itself. Some people might call such a procession a parade,
but it would not be much of one. Real &quot;[p]arades are public
dramas of social relations, and in them performers define who
can be a social actor and what subjects and ideas are available
for communication and consideration.&quot; S. Davis, Parades and
Power: Street Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia 6 (1986).
Hence, we use the word &quot;parade&quot; to indicate marchers
who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each
other but to bystanders along the way. Indeed a parade's dependence
on watchers is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's
celebrated tree, &quot;if a parade or demonstration receives no
media coverage, it may as well not have happened.&quot; Id., at
171. Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and
the inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains
our cases involving protest marches. In Gregory v. Chicago, 394
U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 947, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969), for example,
petitioners had taken part in a procession to express their grievances
to the city government, and we held that such a &quot;march, if
peaceful and orderly, falls well within the sphere of conduct
protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Similarly, in Edwards
v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d
697 (1963), where petitioners had joined in a march of protest
and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner,
we held that the activities &quot;reflect an exercise of these
basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic
form.&quot; Accord, Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147,
152, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969).
<P>
The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited
to its banners and songs, however, for the Constitution looks
beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression. Noting
that &quot;[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas,&quot; West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,
632, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), our cases have
recognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting
a flag (and refusing to do so), id., at 632, 642, 63 S.Ct., at
1182, 1187, wearing an arm band to protest a war, Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-506,
89 S.Ct. 733, 735-736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), displaying a red
flag, Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532,
535, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and even &quot;[m]arching, walking
or parading&quot; in uniforms displaying the swastika, National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205,
53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977). As some of these examples show, a narrow,
succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional
protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a &quot;particularized
message,&quot; cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 411, 94
S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam ), would never
reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock,
music of Arnold Schonberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.
<P>
Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades,
and the South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators
line the streets; people march in costumes and uniforms, carrying
flags and banners with all sorts of messages (e.g., &quot;England
get out of Ireland,&quot; &quot;Say no to drugs&quot;); marching
bands and pipers play, floats are pulled along, and the whole
show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84
(video). To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite
of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in
admitting participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit
constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices,
or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message
as the exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our
precedent, does First Amendment protection require a speaker to
generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication.
Cable operators, for example, are engaged in protected speech
activities even when they only select programming originally produced
by others. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----,
----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2456, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (slip op.,
at 11) (&quot;Cable programmers and cable operators engage in
and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the *2346 protection
of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment&quot;).
For that matter, the presentation of an edited compilation of
speech generated by other persons is a staple of most newspapers'
opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core
of First Amendment security, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 2840, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974),
as does even the simple selection of a paid noncommercial advertisement
for inclusion in a daily paper, see New York Times, 376 U.S.,
at 265-266, 84 S.Ct., at 718-719. The selection of contingents
to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.
<P>
Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally
expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in
it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members'
identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the
Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the
community, and to support the like men and women who sought to
march in the New York parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization
distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions, App.
A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature
of GLIB's participation, see Record, Exh. 84; App. A67 (photograph).
In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner
with the simple inscription &quot;Irish American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston.&quot; GLIB understandably seeks
to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather
than staging one of its own.

The Massachusetts public accommodations law under which respondents
brought suit has a venerable history. At common law, innkeepers,
smiths, and others who &quot;made profession of a public employment,&quot;
were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer. Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484-485, 88 Eng.Rep. 1458,
1464-1465 (K.B.1701) (Holt, C.J.); see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S.
226, 298, n. 17, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 1853, n. 17, 12 L.Ed.2d 822 (1964)
(Goldberg, J., concurring); Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267,
277, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 1127, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963) (Douglas, J.,
concurring). As one of the 19th century English judges put it,
the rule was that &quot;[t]he innkeeper is not to select his guests[;]
[h]e has no right to say to one, you shall come into my inn, and
to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself
in a proper manner has a right to be received; and for this purpose
innkeepers are a sort of public servants.&quot; Rex v. Ivens,
7 Car. &amp; P. 213, 219, 173 Eng.Rep. 94, 96 (N.P.1835); M. Konvitz
&amp; T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights 160 (1961).
<P>
After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the
first State to codify this principle to ensure access to public
accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination
on Account of Color or Race, 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16,
1865); Konvitz &amp; Leskes, supra, at 155-56; L.G. Lerman &amp;
A. Sanderson, Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey
of State and Federal Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U.Rev.L.
&amp; Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978); F. Fox, Discrimination and
Antidiscrimination in Massachusetts Law, 44 B.U.L.Rev. 30, 58
(1964). In prohibiting discrimination &quot;in any licensed inn,
in any public place of amusement, public conveyance or public
meeting,&quot; 1865 Mass.Acts, ch. 277, Sec. 1, the original statute
already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred
any right of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &amp;
Anderson, supra, at 248. As with many public accommodations statutes
across the Nation, the legislature continued to broaden the scope
of legislation, to the point that the law today prohibits discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religious creed, national origin,
sex, sexual orientation ..., deafness, blindness or any physical
or mental disability or ancestry&quot; in &quot;the admission
of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation,
resort or amusement.&quot; Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. Provisions
like these are well within the State's usual power to enact when
a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the
target of discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter,
violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., New York
State Club Assn., Inc. v. City *2347 of New York, 487 U.S. 1,
11-16, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2233-2236, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-626, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
3253-3254, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.
v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258-262, 85 S.Ct. 348, 358-360,
13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964). Nor is this statute unusual in any obvious
way, since it does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate
on the basis of its content, the focal point of its prohibition
being rather on the act of discriminating against individuals
in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and

In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been
applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any
dispute about the participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual
individuals in various units admitted to the parade. The petitioners
disclaim any intent to exclude homosexuals as such, and no individual
member of GLIB claims to have been excluded from parading as a
member of any group that the Council has approved to march. Instead,
the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade
unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B26-B27,
and n. 28. Since every participating unit affects the message
conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' application
of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners
to alter the expressive content of their parade. Although the
state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation,
see, e.g., 418 Mass., at 247-248, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297-1298, once
the expressive character of both the parade and the marching GLIB
contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors'
speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under this approach
any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have
the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication
produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those
protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive
demonstration of their own. But this use of the State's power
violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment,
that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own
message.
<P>
&quot;Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to
say and what to leave unsaid,&quot; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 11, 106 S.Ct.
903, 909, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in
original), one important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide &quot;what
not to say,&quot; id., at 16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Although the
State may at times &quot;prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial
advertising&quot; by requiring the dissemination of &quot;purely
factual and uncontroversial information,&quot; Zauderer v. Office
of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626,
651, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 2281, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985); see Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376,
386-387, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2559-2560, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), outside
that context it may not compel affirmance of a belief with which
the speaker disagrees, see Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642, 63 S.Ct.,
at 1187. Indeed this general rule, that the speaker has the right
to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions of value,
opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the
speaker would rather avoid, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,
514 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d
426 (1995); Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc.,
487 U.S. 781, 797-798, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 2678, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988),
subject, perhaps, to the permissive law of defamation, New York
Times, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,
418 U.S. 323, 347-349, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789
(1974); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct.
876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Nor is the rule's benefit restricted
to the press, being enjoyed by business corporations generally
and by ordinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as
well as by professional publishers. Its point is simply the point
of all speech protection, which is to *2348 shield just those
choices of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even
hurtful. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827,
23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69
S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949).
<P>
Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy
to control one's own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade
is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the
expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and
though the score may not produce a particularized message, each
contingent's expression in the Council's eyes comports with what
merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council
credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the
Council clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from
the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke
its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking
on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message
it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point
(like the Council's) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching
behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to
the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the
presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that
people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified
social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade
units organized around other identifying characteristics. The
parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality
to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance
of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to
keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason,
it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular
point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's
power to control.
<P>
Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and the Massachusetts
law falls short of unconstitutionality, citing the most recent
of our cases on the general subject of compelled access for expressive
purposes, Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445.
There we reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set
aside channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only
intermediate scrutiny. Id., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2469. Respondents
contend on this authority that admission of GLIB to the parade
would not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy because
the Council, like a cable operator, is merely &quot;a conduit&quot;
for the speech of participants in the parade &quot;rather than
itself a speaker.&quot; Brief for Respondent 21. But this metaphor
is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would likely be
perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination
about a unit admitted to the parade, that its message was worthy
of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper,
similarly, &quot;is more than a passive receptacle or conduit
for news, comment, and advertising,&quot; and we have held that
&quot;[t]he choice of material ... and the decisions made as to
limitations on the size and content ... and treatment of public
issues ...--whether fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of
editorial control and judgment&quot; upon which the State can
not intrude. Tornillo, 418 U.S., at 258, 94 S.Ct., at 2840. Indeed,
in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, we invalidated coerced access to
the envelope of a private utility's bill and newsletter because
the utility &quot;may be forced either to appear to agree with
[the intruding leaflet] or to respond.&quot; 475 U.S., at 15,
106 S.Ct., at 911 (plurality) (citation omitted). The plurality
made the further point that if &quot;the government [were] freely
able to compel ... speakers to propound political messages with
which they disagree, ... protection [of a speaker's freedom] would
be empty, for the government could require speakers to affirm
in one breath that which they deny in the next.&quot; Id., at
16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary
to one's own is forced upon a speaker intimately connected with
the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over
the message is compromised.
<P>
In Turner Broadcasting, we found this problem absent in the cable
context, because &quot;[g]iven cable's long history of serving
as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk
that cable viewers would assume *2349 that the broadcast stations
carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by
the cable operator.&quot; 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2465.
We stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity
of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via cable and
that it is &quot;common practice for broadcasters to disclaim
any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers
who use the broadcast facility.&quot; Ibid., 512 U.S., at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2466 (citation omitted); see id., at ----, 114 S.Ct.,
at 2480 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(noting that Congress &quot;might ... conceivably obligate cable
operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels&quot;).
<P>
Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to
be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming
offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does
not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be
transmitted together for individual selection by members of the
audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself,
each is understood to contribute something to a common theme,
and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private
sponsors disavow &quot;any identity of viewpoint&quot; between
themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability
here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving
parade. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74,
87, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2044, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980) (owner of shopping
mall &quot;can expressly disavow any connection with the message
by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers
stand&quot;). Without deciding on the precise significance of
the likelihood of misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear
that in the context of an expressive parade, as with a protest
march, the parade's overall message is distilled from the individual
presentations along the way, and each unit's expression is perceived
by spectators as part of the whole.
<P>
An additional distinction between Turner Broadcasting and this
case points to the fundamental weakness of any attempt to justify
the state court order's limitation on the Council's autonomy as
a speaker. A cable is not only a conduit for speech produced by
others and selected by cable operators for transmission, but a
franchised channel giving monopolistic opportunity to shut out
some speakers. This power gives rise to the government's interest
in limiting monopolistic autonomy in order to allow for the survival
of broadcasters who might otherwise be silenced and consequently
destroyed. The government's interest in Turner Broadcasting was
not the alteration of speech, but the survival of speakers. In
thus identifying an interest going beyond abridgment of speech
itself, the defenders of the law at issue in Turner Broadcasting
addressed the threshold requirement of any review under the Speech
Clause, whatever the ultimate level of scrutiny, that a challenged
restriction on speech serve a compelling, or at least important,
governmental object, see, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra,
at 19, 106 S.Ct., at 913; Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2469; United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377,
88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to the
Turner Broadcasting claim that some speakers will be destroyed
in the absence of the challenged law. True, the size and success
of petitioners' parade makes it an enviable vehicle for the dissemination
of GLIB's views, but that fact, without more, would fall far short
of supporting a claim that petitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly
of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9;
<P>
Brief for Respondents 10 (citing trial court's finding that no
other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that
GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria
developed by the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own,
respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity
to &quot;silence the voice of competing speakers,&quot; as cable
operators do with respect to program providers who wish to reach
subscribers, Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at
2466. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in
support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive
activity like the parade. *2350 The statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Sec.
272:98, is a piece of protective legislation that announces no
purpose beyond the object both expressed and apparent in its provisions,
which is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory
treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including
sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law is to ensure
by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make use of public
accommodations what the old common law promised to any member
of the public wanting a meal at the inn, that accepting the usual
terms of service, they will not be turned away merely on the proprietor's
exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive
activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply
to require speakers to modify the content of their expression
to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it
with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further,
legitimate end, this object is merely to allow exactly what the
general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.
<P>
It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective
is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of discrimination
toward certain classes is to produce a society free of the corresponding
biases.
<P>
Requiring access to a speaker's message would thus be not an end
in itself, but a means to produce speakers free of the biases,
whose expressive conduct would be at least neutral toward the
particular classes, obviating any future need for correction.
But if this indeed is the point of applying the state law to expressive
conduct, it is a decidedly fatal objective. Having availed itself
of the public thoroughfares &quot;for purposes of assembly [and]
communicating thoughts between citizens,&quot; the Council is
engaged in a use of the streets that has &quot;from ancient times,
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties
of citizens.&quot; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization,
307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion
of Roberts, J.). Our tradition of free speech commands that a
speaker who takes to the street corner to express his views in
this way should be free from interference by the State based on
the content of what he says. See, e.g., Police Department of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212
(1972); cf. H. Kalven, Jr., A Worthy Tradition 6-19 (1988); O.
Fiss, Free Speech and Social Structure, 71 Iowa L.Rev. 1405, 1408-1409
(1986). The very idea that a noncommercial speech restriction
be used to produce thoughts and statements acceptable to some
groups or, indeed, all people, grates on the First Amendment,
for it amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech
in the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has no
more certain antithesis. See, e.g., Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642,
63 S.Ct., at 1187; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 475 U.S., at 20,
106 S.Ct., at 914. While the law is free to promote all sorts
of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it is not free to interfere
with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message
or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose
may strike the government.
<P>
Far from supporting GLIB, then, Turner Broadcasting points to
the reasons why the present application of the Massachusetts law
can not be sustained. So do the two other principal authorities
GLIB has cited. In PruneYard, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S.Ct. 2035, to
be sure, we sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of
shopping malls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political
petitions without a showing that the shopping mall owners would
otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from reaching an
audience. But we found in that case that the proprietors were
running &quot;a business establishment that is open to the public
to come and go as they please,&quot; that the solicitations would
&quot;not likely be identified with those of the owner,&quot;
and that the proprietors could &quot;expressly disavow any connection
with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the
speakers or handbillers stand.&quot; Id., at 87, 100 S.Ct., at
2044. Also, in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra, at 12, 106 S.Ct.,
at 909, we noted that PruneYard did not involve &quot;any concern
that access to this area might affect the shopping center owner's
exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege
that he objected to the content of the pamphlets....&quot; The
principle of speaker's *2351. autonomy was simply not threatened
in that case.
<P>
New York State Club Association is also instructive by the contrast
it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge to a state
antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that the expressive
associational character of a dining club with over 400 members
could be sufficiently attenuated to permit application of the
law even to such a private organization, but we also recognized
that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views
were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships.
487 U.S., at 13, 108 S.Ct. at 2234; see also Roberts, 468 U.S.,
at 627, 104 S.Ct. at 3254. In other words, although the association
provided public benefits to which a State could ensure equal access,
it was also engaged in expressive activity; compelled access to
the benefit, which was upheld, did not trespass on the organization's
message itself. If we were to analyze this case strictly along
those lines, GLIB would lose. Assuming the parade to be large
enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that
would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with
its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude
an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position
taken by the club's existing members.
<P>
IV
<P>
Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's
message but on the Nation's commitment to protect freedom of speech.
<P>
Disapproval of a private speaker's statement does not legitimize
use of the Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter
the message by including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed and the
case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.

but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience
of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S.
321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. The court dismissed the public accommodations law claim against
the city because it found that the city's actions did not amount
to inciting or assisting in the Council's violations of Sec. 272:98.
App. to Pet. for Cert. B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents'
First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for
want of state action triggering the proscriptions of those Amendments.
Id., at B14-B22. Finally, the court did not reach the state constitutional
questions, since respondents had apparently assumed in their arguments
that those claims, too, depended for their success upon a finding
of state action and because of the court's holding that the public
accommodation statutes apply to the parade. Id., at B22.
<P>
FN2. Since respondents did not cross-appeal the dismissal of their
claims against the city, the Supreme Judicial Court declined to
reach those claims. 418 Mass., at 245, n. 12, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence
for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's race. The State Court of
Appeals rejected his challenge to the law's constitutionality,
but the State Supreme Court reversed. Relying on R.A.V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 it held that
the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the
legislature has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the
State's contention that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional
victim selection. It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally
overbroad because the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech
would have a chilling effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted
for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination,
whereas the state statute punishes the subjective mental process.
<P>
Held: Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the
application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing
him. Pp. 2198-2202.
<P>
(a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by
a state court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme
Court did not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized
the statute's practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus,
after resolving any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this
Court may form its own judgment about the law's operative effect.
The State's argument that the statute punishes only conduct does
not dispose of Mitchell's claim, since the fact remains that the
same criminal conduct is more heavily punished if the victim is
selected *2196 because of his protected status than if no such
motive obtains. Pp. 2198-99.
<P>
(b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges
have traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition
to evidence bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for
committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing
judge may not take into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, the Constitution does not erect
a per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are
protected by the First Amendment. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S.
----, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309; Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (plurality opinion).
That Dawson and Barclay did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement
provision does not make them inapposite. Barclay involved the
consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence
a defendant to death, the most severe &quot;enhancement&quot;
of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility
for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under
the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination
laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge.
Nothing in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra, compels a different result
here. The ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at
speech, while the one here is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what
it sees as the greater individual and societal harm inflicted
by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for
the provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'
beliefs or biases. Pp. 2199-2201.
<P>
(c) Because the statute has no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on
free speech, it is not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect
of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence
of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he
commits a serious offense against person or property is too speculative
a hypothesis to support this claim. Moreover, the First Amendment
permits the admission of previous declarations or statements to
establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent,
subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability,
and the like. Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874,
91 L.Ed. 1145. Pp. 2201-02.

Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was
enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account
of the victim's race. The question presented in this case is whether
this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. We hold that it is not.
<P>
On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men
and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment complex
in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the group discussed
a scene from the motion picture &quot;Mississippi Burning,&quot;
in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. The
group moved outside and Mitchell asked them: &quot; 'Do you all
feel hyped up to move on some white people?' &quot; Brief for
Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, a young white boy approached
the group on the opposite side of the street where they were standing.
As the boy walked by, Mitchell said: &quot; 'You *2197 all want
to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him.' &quot;
Id., at 4-5. Mitchell counted to three and pointed in the boy's
direction. The group ran towards the boy, beat him severely, and
stole his tennis shoes.
<P>
The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four
days.
<P>
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell
was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis.Stat. Secs. 939.05 and
940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum
sentence of two years' imprisonment. Secs. 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e).
But because the jury found that Mitchell had intentionally selected
his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for
Mitchell's offense was increased to seven years under Sec. 939.645.
That provision enhances the maximum penalty for an offense whenever
the defendant &quot;[i]ntentionally selects the person against
whom the crime ... is committed ... because of the race, religion,
color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry
of that person....&quot; Sec. 939.645(1)(b). (FN1) The Circuit
Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated
battery.
<P>
Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit
Court. Then he appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging
the constitutionality of Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision
on First Amendment grounds. (FN2) The Wisconsin Court of Appeals
rejected Mitchell's challenge, 163 Wis.2d 652, 473 N.W.2d 1 (1991),
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court held
that the statute &quot;violates the First Amendment directly by
punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought.&quot;169 Wis.2d 153, 163, 485 N.W.2d 807, 811 (1992). It rejected the
State's contention &quot;that the statute punishes only the 'conduct'
of intentional selection of a victim.&quot; Id., at 164, 485 N.W.2d,
at 812. According to the court, &quot;[t]he statute punishes the
'because of' aspect of the defendant's selection, the reason the
defendant selected the victim, the motive behind the selection.&quot;
Ibid. (emphasis in original). And under R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505
U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), &quot;the Wisconsin
legislature *2198 cannot criminalize bigoted thought with which
it disagrees.&quot; 169 Wis.2d, at 171, 485 N.W.2d, at 815.
<P>
The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute
was unconstitutionally overbroad. It reasoned that, in order to
prove that a defendant intentionally selected his victim because
of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to
introduce evidence of the defendant's prior speech, such as racial
epithets he may have uttered before the commission of the offense.
This evidentiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would
have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on those who feared the possibility
of prosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. See
id., at 174, 485 N.W.2d, at 816. Finally, the court distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the &quot;subjective
mental process&quot; of selecting a victim because of his protected
status, whereas antidiscrimination laws prohibit &quot;objective
acts of discrimination.&quot; Id., at 176, 485 N.W.2d, at 817.
(FN3)
<P>
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question
presented and the existence of a conflict of authority among state
high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's
penalty-enhancement provision, (FN4) 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct.
810, 121 L.Ed.2d 683 (1992). We reverse.
<P>
Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's
conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted thought and not conduct.
There is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction
of a state statute. R.A.V., supra, at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2541-2542; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24, 102
S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982);
<P>
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895, 93 L.Ed.
1131 (1949). In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts
had defined the term &quot; 'breach of the peace,' &quot; in a
city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include &quot;
'stirs the public to anger ... or creates a disturbance.' &quot;
Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct., at 895. We held this construction to be binding
on us. But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly
speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular statutory word or phrase. Rather,
it merely characterized the &quot;practical effect&quot; of the
statute for First Amendment purposes. See 169 *2199 Wis.2d, at
166-167, 485 N.W.2d, at 813 (&quot;Merely because the statute
refers in a literal sense to the intentional 'conduct' of selecting,
does not mean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and
practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought&quot;).
This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities as to the
meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form our own judgment
as to its operative effect.
<P>
The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted thought,
as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead punishes only
conduct. While this argument is literally correct, it does not
dispose of Mitchell's First Amendment challenge. To be sure, our
cases reject the &quot;view that an apparently limitless variety
of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging
in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.&quot; United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20
L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); accord, R.A.V., 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2544; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727,
2729, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam );  Cox v. Louisiana,
379 U.S. 536, 555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 464, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965). Thus,
a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive
conduct protected by the First Amendment. See Roberts v. United
States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255, 82 L.Ed.2d
462 (1984) (&quot;[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative
impact ... are entitled to no constitutional protection&quot;);
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct.
3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (&quot;The First Amendment
does not protect violence&quot;).
<P>
But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the same
criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is
selected because of his race or other protected status than if
no such motive obtained. Thus, although the statute punishes criminal
conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated
by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the same
conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all.
Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's
discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates
the First Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.
<P>
Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety
of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining
what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2605, 115 L.Ed.2d
720 (1991); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct.
589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.
241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). The defendant's
motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See
1 W. LeFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 3.6(b),
p. 324 (1986) (&quot;Motives are most relevant when the trial
judge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommon for
a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because he was acting
with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad
motives&quot;); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 156, 107 S.Ct.
1676, 1687, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) (&quot;Deeply ingrained in our
legal tradition is the idea that the more purposeful is the criminal
conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the
more severely it ought to be punished&quot;). Thus, in many States
the commission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary
gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the capital-sentencing
statute. See, e.g., Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 13-703(F)(5) (1989);
Fla.Stat. Sec.
<P>
921.141(5)(f) (Supp.1992); Miss.Code Ann. Sec. 99-19-101(5)(f)
(Supp.1992); N.C.Gen.Stat. Sec. 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo.Stat.
Sec. 6-2-102(h)(vi) (Supp.1992).
<P>
*2200 But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration
by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced
evidence at a capital-sentencing hearing that the defendant was
a member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because &quot;the
evidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstract beliefs,&quot;
we held that its admission violated the defendant's First Amendment
rights. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1098. In so holding, however,
we emphasized that &quot;the Constitution does not erect a per
se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs
and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and
associations are protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1094. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983) (plurality opinion),
we allowed the sentencing judge to take into account the defendant's
racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed
that the defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Army and
desire to provoke a &quot;race war&quot; were related to the murder
of a white man for which he was convicted. See id., at 942-944,
103 S.Ct., at 3421-3422. Because &quot;the elements of racial
hatred in [the] murder&quot; were relevant to several aggravating
factors, we held that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence
into account in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,
and n. 7, 103 S.Ct., at 3424, and n. 7.
<P>
Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite because
they did not involve application of a penalty-enhancement provision.
But in Barclay we held that it was permissible for the sentencing
court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining
whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe
&quot;enhancement&quot; of all. And the fact that the Wisconsin
Legislature has decided, as a general matter, that bias-motivated
offenses warrant greater maximum penalties across the board does
not alter the result here. For the primary responsibility for
fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v.
Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1139, 63 L.Ed.2d 382
(1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280,
1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958).
<P>
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute
is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory
motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays the same role
under the Wisconsin statute as it does under federal and state
antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously upheld against
constitutional challenge. See Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S., at
628, 104 S.Ct., at 3255; Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S.
69, 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2235, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2597, 49 L.Ed.2d 415
(1976). Title VII, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer
to discriminate against an employee &quot;because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, we rejected the
argument that Title VII infringed employers' First Amendment rights.
And more recently, in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2546, we cited Title VII (as well as 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242 and 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible
content-neutral regulation of conduct.
<P>
Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different
result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to
a municipal ordinance prohibiting the use of &quot; 'fighting
words' that insult, or provoke violence, 'on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.' &quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2547 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,
St. Paul, Minn., Legis.Code Sec. 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance
only proscribed a class of &quot;fighting words&quot; deemed particularly
offensive by the city--i.e., those &quot;that contain ... messages
of 'bias-motivated' hatred,&quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at *2201 2547 we held that it violated the rule against content-based
discrimination. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547-2548. But
whereas the ordinance struck down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed
at expression (i.e., &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;messages,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547, the statute in this case is
aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired
conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual
and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its
amici, bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory
crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and
incite community unrest. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27;
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as Amicus Curiae 18-22; Brief
for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 17-19;
Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici Curiae 9-10;
<P>
Brief for Congressman Charles E. Schumer et al. as Amici Curiae
8-9. The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides
an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision
over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases.
As Blackstone said long ago, &quot;it is but reasonable that among
crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished,
which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.&quot;
4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.
<P>
Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that
the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because
of its &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech. Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the statute is &quot;overbroad&quot;
because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations
may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's protected status.
<P>
Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills
free expression with respect to such matters by those concerned
about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in
the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We
find no merit in this contention.
<P>
The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely
than that contemplated in traditional &quot;overbreadth&quot;
cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing
his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that if he later commits
an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered
at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of
the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-enhancement.
To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to
one side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute, such
as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis.Stat. Sec. 941.01
(1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive
of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated.
We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen suppressing
his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will
be introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious
offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative
a hypothesis to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim.
<P>
The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary
use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove
motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations
or statements is commonly admitted in criminal trials subject
to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and
the like. Nearly half a century ago, in Haupt v. United States,
330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874, 91 L.Ed. 1145 (1947), we rejected
a contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt
was tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the
Constitution (Art. III, Sec. 3), may depend very much on proof
of motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out
of &quot;adherence *2202. to the enemy&quot; rather than &quot;parental
solicitude,&quot; id., at 641, 67 S.Ct., at 878, the Government
introduced evidence of conversations that had taken place long
prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements
showing Haupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility
towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argument that this
evidence was improperly admitted. While &quot;[s]uch testimony
is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are
not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion
with our own government or quite proper appreciation of the land
of birth,&quot; we held that &quot;these statements ... clearly
were admissible on the question of intent and adherence to the
enemy.&quot; Id., at 642, 67 S.Ct., at 879. See also Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251-252, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1791-1792,
104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion) (allowing evidentiary
use of defendant's speech in evaluating Title VII discrimination
claim); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 594, 89 S.Ct. 1354,
1366-1367, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969).
<P>
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment
rights were not violated by the application of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
provision in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court
but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience
of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S.
321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
statute provided:
<P>
&quot;(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties
for the underlying crime are increased as provided in sub. (2):
<P>
&quot;(a) Commits a crime under chs. 939 to 948.
<P>
&quot;(b) Intentionally selects the person against whom the crime
<P>
under par. (a) is committed or selects the property which is damaged
or otherwise affected by the crime under par. (a) because of the
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of
that property.
<P>
&quot;(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a misdemeanor other than a Class A misdemeanor, the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is one year in the county jail.
<P>
&quot;(b) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a Class A misdemeanor, the penalty increase under this section
changes the status of the crime to a felony and the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is 2 years.
<P>
&quot;(c) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is a felony, the
maximum fine prescribed by law for the crime may be increased
by not more than $5,000 and the maximum period of imprisonment
prescribed by law for the crime may be increased by not more than
5 years.
<P>
&quot;(3) This section provides for the enhancement of the penalties
applicable for the underlying crime. The court shall direct that
the trier of fact find a special verdict as to all of the issues
specified in sub. (1).
<P>
&quot;(4) This section does not apply to any crime if proof of
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry is required for a conviction for that crime.&quot;
Wis.Stat. Sec. 939.645 (1989-1990). The statute was amended in
1992, but the amendments are not at issue in this case.
<P>
FN2. Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment
equal protection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of
Appeals held that Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and
rejected his vagueness challenge outright. 163 Wis.2d 652, 473
N.W.2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address
both claims. 169 Wis.2d 153, 158, n. 2, 485 N.W.2d 807, 809, n.
2 (1992). Mitchell renews his Fourteenth Amendment claims in this
Court. But since they were not developed below and plainly fall
outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do
not reach them either.
<P>
FN3. Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished
discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have
upheld it. See 169 Wis.2d at 181, 485 N.W.2d, at 819 (Abrahamson,
J.); id., at 187-195, 485 N.W.2d at 821-825 (Bablitch, J.).
<P>
FN4. Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions
similar to the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e.g.,
Cal.Penal Code Ann. Sec. 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp.1993); Fla.Stat.
Sec. 775.085 (1991); Mont.Code Ann. Sec. 45-5-222 (1992); Vt.Stat.Ann.,
Tit. 13, Sec. 1455 (Supp.1992). Proposed federal legislation to
the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H.R.
4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed to pass the Senate,
S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state high courts are
divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes
and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,
e.g., State v. Plowman, 314 Or. 157, 838 P.2d 558 (1992) (upholding
Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St.3d 566, 597 N.E.2d
450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis.2d 153, 485 N.W.2d
807 (1992) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,
bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States.
See, e.g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium et al. as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation
League et al. as Amici Curiae 4-7; Brief for Atlanta et al. as
Amici Curiae 3-12. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics
Act, Pub.L. 101-275, Sec. 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at
28 U.S.C. Sec. 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp. III), directing the
Attorney General to compile data &quot;about crimes that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,
or ethnicity.&quot; Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation reported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated
offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of
intimidation, 1,301 incidents of vandalism, 796 simple assaults,
773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders. See Brief for the Crown
Heights Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 1A-7A.

Before ANDERSON and TACHA, Circuit Judges, and COOK, District
Judge. (FN*)
<P>
TACHA, Circuit Judge.
<P>
Appellants appeal an order of the district court granting defendants'
motion for summary judgment. Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v.
Romer, 750 F.Supp. 1041 (D.Colo.1990). On appeal, appellants contend
that the Governor of Colorado violated their First Amendment rights
by using state resources to defeat an amendment on the ballot
at a Colorado general election. Appellee Romer cross appeals asserting
that appellants lack standing to pursue this action. We exercise
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 and dismiss the appeal
for lack of standing.
<P>
BACKGROUND
<P>
In October of 1988, the citizens of Colorado placed an initiative,
commonly referred to as Amendment six, on the ballot at the Colorado
general election. Amendment six focused on statewide tax reform
and would have allowed the citizens of Colorado to vote directly
on any significant change in state tax laws.
<P>
Appellee Romer, the Governor of the State of Colorado, and defendant
Citizens for Representative Government, of which defendants Phil
Fox and Clark Shaw were members, publicly opposed the amendment.
Appellants assert that Governor Romer used numerous public resources
to publicly oppose the amendment. These resources allegedly included
staff time, equipment and supplies, travel resources, and facilities
at the state mansion and state capital office. Amendment six eventually
was defeated in the Colorado general election.
<P>
After the defeat of the amendment, appellants filed a suit in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Appellants claimed that
Governor Romer violated their First Amendment rights by using
state resources and the power and prestige of his office to oppose
the amendment. Appellants also asserted that the Governor and
the other defendants combined in a conspiracy to violate the appellants'
constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985(3) and
common law.
<P>
Asserting that appellants lacked standing and that they failed
to state a claim for relief for a violation of the United States
Constitution, defendants moved for summary judgment. Appellants
cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court *1396 denied
appellants' motion and then addressed defendants' motion, denying
it in part and granting it in part. The district court found that
appellants had standing to sue, but that Governor Romer's expenditures
were &quot;de minimis&quot; so that the appellants failed to state
a claim.
<P>
DISCUSSION
<P>
On appeal, Romer contends that appellants lack standing to pursue
this action. Because we agree with this contention, we address
only the standing argument and do not address the merits of appellants'
contentions on appeal. In this case, appellants are two associations,
the Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Colorado Libertarian Party,
and a number of individuals.
<P>
Before a party may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
Article III requires that the party demonstrate that (1) &quot;
'he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as
a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant' &quot;;
(2) &quot;the injury 'fairly can be traced to the challenged action'
&quot;; and (3) the injury &quot; 'is likely to be redressed by
a favorable decision.' &quot; Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., 454
U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (quoting
Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99
S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) and Simon v. Eastern Ky.
<P>
Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924,
1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). If a party satisfies these minimum
constitutional requirements, then a court may still deny standing
for prudential reasons if the injury alleged constitutes a &quot;generalized
grievance&quot; that more appropriately should be addressed by
the representative branches. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The district court concluded that plaintiffs &quot;alleged sufficient
injury for standing.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. Romer,
750 F.Supp. 1041, 1043 (D.Colo.1990). In support of this conclusion,
the district court stated that &quot;[t]he harm consists of the
additional burden imposed on the plaintiffs by the defendants'
allegedly unconstitutional acts. Like the plaintiffs in Common
Cause v. Bolger, [512 F.Supp. 26, 30 (D.D.C.1980) ], the plaintiffs
here have alleged that their campaign for Amendment 6 would not
have been so difficult (and, in fact, might have been successful)
but for the defendants' acts.&quot; Id. We must now determine
whether the individuals or either of the associations, the Colorado
Libertarian Party or the Colorado Taxpayers Union, have standing
to bring this suit.
<P>
A. The Colorado Libertarian Party
<P>
Appellants contend that the Libertarian Party has standing to
sue because it seeks judicial relief for injuries to the organization.
An organization has standing on its own behalf if it meets the
standing requirements that apply to individuals. Havens Realty
Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,
71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). To have standing, plaintiffs must allege
&quot; 'such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy'
as to warrant ... invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.&quot;
Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp.,
429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (quoting
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d
663 (1962)). Appellants must demonstrate that their alleged injury
is an &quot;injury in fact, economic or otherwise.&quot; Association
of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152,
90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The injury must be &quot;
'distinct and palpable,' &quot; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L.Ed.2d
66 (1979) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct.
2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)), and &quot;real and immediate,&quot;
not abstract, conjectural, speculative, or hypothetical, City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660,
1664-65, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).
<P>
Appellants claim that Governor Romer used his staff and the resources
of his office to defeat the tax initiative supported by the Libertarian
Party and thus forced *1397 the Party to bear a greater burden
in its attempt to pass the amendment. Appellants claim that under
Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124, this drain on resources
is a concrete and demonstrable injury.
<P>
In Havens, the Supreme Court found that an organization was entitled
to standing on its own behalf because the organization alleged
that an apartment owner's racial steering practices had perceptively
impaired the organization's ability to provide counseling and
referral services for low and moderate income home seekers. The
Court stated that &quot;[s]uch [a] concrete and demonstrable injury
to the organization's activities--with the consequent drain on
the organization's resources--constitutes far more than simply
a setback to the organization's abstract social interests.&quot;
Id. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124.
<P>
Appellants' argument that they were forced to counteract the Governor's
activities through the expenditure of additional funds is purely
conjectural.
<P>
Such an argument simply does not demonstrate that the Libertarian
Party or its members have suffered a distinct and concrete injury.
At most, the Libertarian Party's allegations suggest only that
the organization has received a minor setback to its organizational
purpose. The Libertarian Party's argument would require this court
to engage in a futile act of speculation in order to determine
the extent of some remote, uncertain injury. This type of conjectural
injury cannot establish standing under Havens. In Havens, the
defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct could be tied directly
to a concrete harm inflicted upon the primary activity of the
plaintiff organization--the organization's counseling and referral
efforts were rendered futile when the defendant turned away referred
applicants. Here, appellants' actions in spending additional funds
simply cannot be traced to the Governor's allegedly illegal expenditures.
It is pure conjecture to assume that Governor Romer's activities
caused appellants to drain their resources. Thus, we conclude
that appellants have not &quot;allege[d] [a] personal injury fairly
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely
to be redressed by the requested relief.&quot; Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The Libertarian Party also argues that it suffered an injury when
its First Amendment rights were chilled. Appellants contend that
the allegedly illegal expenditures by the Governor effectively
imposed a tax upon the Libertarian Party in its effort to exercise
its First Amendment right to petition. Essentially, appellants
claim that the dilution of Party resources chilled the exercise
of First Amendment rights.
<P>
We cannot agree with the characterization of the Governor's activities
as a &quot;tax&quot; on the Libertarian Party or its members'
First Amendment right to petition. The Governor's activities in
no way prevented the Libertarian Party or its members from petitioning
the government. The Governor's activities only commenced once
the amendment was placed on the ballot. The Governor's allegedly
unlawful activities never prevented members of the Libertarian
Party from associating, speaking on behalf of the amendment, or
voting on the amendment. Further, the Libertarian Party and its
members failed to demonstrate that Romer's activities impacted
their ability to petition the government of Colorado in the future.
Thus, neither the Libertarian Party nor its members has demonstrated
that First Amendment rights were chilled.
<P>
The Libertarian Party contends that even if it has not been injured,
it is entitled to standing on behalf of its members. In Hunt v.
Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343,
97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), the Supreme Court
announced a three-part test for associational standing:
<P>
[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members
when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in
their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane
to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted
nor the relief *1398 requested requires the participation of the
individual members in the lawsuit.
<P>
Because we conclude that the Libertarian Party's members do not
have standing to sue in their own right, the Party is not entitled
to associational standing.
<P>
B. The Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Individual Appellants
<P>
The individual appellants claim that they are entitled to standing
as taxpayers. The Colorado Taxpayers Union asserts standing as
an organization suing on behalf of its tax-paying members. Appellants
argue that the Governor illegally used state tax funds in order
to defeat Amendment six and that this misappropriation entitles
them to standing under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942,
20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The district court stated that &quot;[t]he
essence of the plaintiffs' position is that when the Governor
becomes an advocate against a citizen initiative, he has exceeded
the limits of his official power and interfered in the process
by which the people exercise their sovereign right to change the
authority of the officials who govern them.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers
Union, Inc., 750 F.Supp. at 1044. Appellee Romer argues that this
claim is insufficient to give appellants taxpayer standing under
Flast.
<P>
Most of the taxpayer standing cases addressed by the Supreme Court
deal with federal taxpayer standing. The general prohibition against
federal taxpayer standing originated in Frothingham v. Mellon,
262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). In Frothingham,
the Supreme Court held that a federal taxpayer lacks standing
to sue to enjoin federal officials from enforcing a  federal statute
authorizing appropriations of public money. The federal taxpayer
attacked the Maternity Act of 1921, which established a federal
program of grants to states to reduce maternal and infant mortality.
The taxpayer alleged that Congress, in enacting the Act, exceeded
its powers under Article I of the Constitution. She argued that
&quot;the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to
increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property
without due process of law.&quot; Id. at 486, 43 S.Ct. at 600.
<P>
The Court began its analysis by noting that &quot;[t]he interest
of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys
is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent
their misuse in not inappropriate. It is upheld by a large number
of state cases and is the rule of this court.&quot; Id. The Court
then distinguished federal taxpayers from municipal taxpayers
and stated that a federal taxpayer's &quot;interest in the moneys
of the treasury ... is comparatively minute and indeterminable&quot;
and that &quot;the effect upon future taxation, of any payment
out of the [Treasury's] funds, [is] remote, fluctuating and uncertain.&quot;
Id. at 487, 43 S.Ct. at 601. Thus, the Court found that the federal
taxpayer lacked standing.
<P>
In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947
(1968), the Court created an exception to the bar on federal taxpayer
standing in the context of Establishment Clause challenges. The
Court asked &quot;whether the Frothingham barrier should be lowered
when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it
violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First
Amendment.&quot; Id. at 85, 88 S.Ct. at 1944. To resolve this
issue, the Court noted that a court must &quot;determine whether
there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated.&quot; Id. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953.
The Court then concluded that the nexus requirement for a federal
taxpayer contains two aspects. &quot;First, the taxpayer must
establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative
enactment attacked.&quot; Id. Under this first aspect, a taxpayer
can only challenge the unconstitutionality of exercises of congressional
power under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Article I, Section
8 of the Constitution. The second aspect requires that a taxpayer
establish &quot;a nexus between that status and the precise nature
of the constitutional infringement alleged.&quot; Id. To satisfy
this requirement, a taxpayer must show that the challenged action
&quot;exceeds specific  constitutional limitations imposed upon
the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power.&quot;
Id. at 102- *1399 03, 88 S.Ct. at 1953-54. In Flast, the taxpayers
satisfied both aspects of the required nexus because they challenged
a congressional exercise of power under Article I, Section 8 and
because they asserted that the congressional expenditures violated
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which specifically
limits the taxing and spending power of Article I, Section 8.
<P>
After Flast, the Court consistently has adhered to the &quot;narrow
exception [Flast ] created to the general rule against taxpayer
standing.&quot; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 618, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 2579, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). In Valley Forge Christian
College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State,
Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), the
Court held that federal taxpayers lacked standing to challenge
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW) decision
to give property to a religious institution. The Court rejected
the taxpayers' standing argument because the &quot;source of their
complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW
to transfer a parcel of federal property.&quot; Id. at 479, 102
S.Ct. at 762. The Court also reasoned that &quot;the property
transfer about which [the taxpayers] complain was not an exercise
of authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause.&quot;
Id. at 480, 102 S.Ct. at 762. (FN1) Thus, the Court has indicated
that Flast applies only to cases in which a federal taxpayer challenges
a congressional appropriation made pursuant to Article I, Section
8 that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment. See United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct.
2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974);
<P>
Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,
228, 94 S.Ct.
<P>
2925, 2935, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974); Flast, 392 U.S. at 114, 115,
88 S.Ct. at 1959, 1960 (Stewart, J., concurring and Fortas, J.,
concurring); see also Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912, 916 (6th
Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d
148 (1988).
<P>
Both parties mistakenly rely on Flast to resolve whether appellants
qualify for taxpayer standing in this case. Flast does not directly
govern this appeal because it applies to federal taxpayer standing
issues, not questions relating to standing for state taxpayers.
Although neither Frothingham nor Flast analyzes questions of state
taxpayer standing invoked to challenge state taxes or expenditures,
the Supreme Court briefly addressed the issue in Doremus v. Board
of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).
<P>
In Doremus, New Jersey state taxpayers sued the State of New Jersey
seeking a declaratory judgment that a state law authorizing public
school teachers to read from the Bible violated the First Amendment.
The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing because
they did not allege any direct injury to themselves. The Court
stated that [t]here is no allegation that this activity is supported
by any separate tax or paid for from any particular appropriation
or that it adds any sum whatever to the cost of conducting the
school. No information is given as to what kind of taxes are paid
by appellants and there is no averment that the Bible reading
increases any tax they do pay or that as taxpayers they are, will,
or possibly can be out of pocket because of it.
<P>
Id. at 433, 72 S.Ct. at 397. The Court reiterated that a taxpayer
&quot; 'must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid,
but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining
some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely
that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'
&quot; Id. at 434, 72 S.Ct. at 397 (quoting Commonwealth of Mass.
v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601, 67 L.Ed. 1078
(1923)). The Court held that &quot;[t]he taxpayer's action can
meet this test, but only *1400 when it is a good-faith pocketbook
action.&quot; Id. Thus, we must determine whether appellants'
action satisfies the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement.
<P>
After Doremus, the federal courts have addressed the issue of
state taxpayer standing and the type of claim that satisfies the
good-faith pocketbook requirement infrequently. In Hoohuli v.
Ariyoshi, 741 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir.1984), the Ninth Circuit examined
the issue of state taxpayer standing and concluded that the plaintiffs
met the Doremus requirements. In Hoohuli, state taxpayers brought
an action challenging a system established by the State of Hawaii
that disbursed benefits to residents who had descended from aboriginal
inhabitants of the islands. The taxpayers claimed that &quot;their
tax dollars were being spent on a program which disbursed benefits
based on impermissible racial classifications.&quot; Id. at 1172.
<P>
After reviewing Frothingham and Doremus, the Ninth Circuit concluded
that &quot;[s]tate taxpayers could still maintain taxpayer suits
if their pleadings were sufficient. They were sufficient if they
set forth the relationship between taxpayer, tax dollars, and
the allegedly illegal government activity.&quot; Id. at 1178 (citation
omitted). To reach this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reviewed
Flast and its progeny and found that because the Supreme Court
did not discuss Doremus in the second part of the Flast nexus
test, it implicitly distinguished between standing requirements
for federal and state taxpayers. Id. at 1179. Thus, the Ninth
Circuit decided that state taxpayer standing remained unchanged
after Flast and must be guided by Doremus in its original form.
Id. at 1179-80.
<P>
Based on this analysis, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs
had satisfied the &quot;good-faith pocketbook action&quot; of
Doremus. Each of the plaintiffs set forth his or her status as
a taxpayer. The taxpayers challenged the appropriation, transfer
and spending of taxpayers' money from the general fund of the
state treasury. Further, the taxpayers alleged that they &quot;ha[d]
been burdened with the necessity to provide more taxes to support&quot;
the program.
<P>
Id. at 1180. The Ninth Circuit concluded that &quot;[t]he pleadings
set forth with specificity amounts of money appropriated and spent
for allegedly unlawful purposes.&quot; Id. Thus, under the test
announced by the Ninth Circuit, a taxpayer must satisfy three
requirements: (1) taxpayer status; (2) the appropriation of monies
from the state's general funds; and (3) the spending of those
funds for allegedly unlawful purposes. (FN2) Under this standard,
a taxpayer need not demonstrate that &quot;her tax burden will
be lightened by elimination of the questioned expenditure.&quot;
Cammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1991), petition for cert.
filed, 60 USLW 3406 (Nov. 12, 1991). (FN3)
<P>
The Eighth Circuit, in Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall,
891 F.2d 1354 (8th Cir.1989), agreed with the Ninth Circuit's
approach to state taxpayer standing. In Randall, the plaintiffs,
a teachers' union and its president, brought an action challenging
the constitutionality of the Minnesota Post-Secondary Enrollment
Options Act. Pursuant to the Act, public high school students
in their junior and senior years could take advanced courses at
two- and four-year colleges, some of which were religiously affiliated.
The plaintiffs alleged that the Act violated the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Protesting the disbursement of
tax money to sectarian schools and arguing that reallocation of
funds reduced money available for his salary, the president of
the teachers' union asserted standing as a taxpayer. *1401 The
district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing because
it believed that to achieve state taxpayer standing, the plaintiff
would have to show an increase in his tax bill under Doremus.
Id. at 1357. The Eighth Circuit disagreed, concluding that Doremus
did not require a showing of an increased tax burden. The court
reasoned that &quot;only a taxpayer really suffers a distinct
injury from the improper use of public money in violation of the
establishment clause&quot; and &quot;that taxpayer standing was
created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims.&quot;
Id. at 1358. The Eighth Circuit concluded, &quot;we do not believe
that state taxpayers are required to show an increase in their
tax burdens to allege sufficient injury.&quot; Id.
<P>
The Sixth Circuit addressed the issue of state taxpayer standing
in Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488
U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d 148 (1988). In Taub, a state
taxpayer brought an action against Kentucky, its governor, and
other executive officers to prevent them from spending state tax
revenues in connection with the construction of an automotive
assembly plant. The plaintiff, who paid approximately $1,200 dollars
in state property taxes, claimed that &quot;the action of the
Commonwealth and various officials of the executive branch amount[ed]
to the taking of  private property through taxation for other
than a public purpose.&quot; Id. at 914. After reviewing the federal
taxpayer standing cases, the court noted that few cases have addressed
the standing of state taxpayers where the Establishment Clause
is not an issue, whereas municipal taxpayer standing has been
recognized in a variety of contexts. Id. at 917. The Sixth Circuit
then noted that challenges to the Establishment Clause create
a unique situation in state taxpayer standing cases. Relying on
the Supreme Court's notation in School District of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 380 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3220 n. 5, 87
L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), that the Court has &quot;adjudicated [numerous]
Establishment Clause challenges by state taxpayers to programs
for aiding nonpublic schools,&quot; the Sixth Circuit stated that
&quot;[t]his observation [by the Supreme Court] points up the
distinctive treatment of standing when the Establishment Clause
is involved, but does not indicate any rule with respect to other
state taxpayer suits.&quot; Taub, 842 F.2d at 917.
<P>
After undertaking the preceding analysis and reviewing Doremus,
the court conclude[d] that the requirements for federal taxpayer
standing announced in Frothingham control the issue of state taxpayer
standing, at least in those cases where violation of the Establishment
Clause is not alleged.... In order to have standing, a state taxpayer
must allege direct and palpable injury with sufficient specificity
to meet the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus.
<P>
Id. at 918. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's
conclusion in Hoohuli that a state taxpayer must only allege that
appropriated funds were spent for unlawful purposes. Id. at 918-19.
In addition to this requirement, the court required that &quot;[a]
state taxpayer ... tie such allegations of illegal appropriations
and expenditures to a specific claim of some direct and palpable
injury threatened or suffered.&quot; Id. at 919.
<P>
After considering the cases relating to both federal and state
taxpayer standing, we conclude that, where an Establishment Clause
violation is not asserted, a state taxpayer must allege that appropriated
funds were spent for an allegedly unlawful purpose and that the
illegal appropriations and expenditures are tied to a direct and
palpable injury threatened or suffered. Only by meeting these
requirements will a state taxpayer satisfy the &quot;good-faith
pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus. A state taxpayer must
demonstrate that she will be &quot;out of pocket&quot; because
of the allegedly illegal appropriation. Doremus, 342 U.S. at 433,
72 S.Ct. at 396.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the Supreme Court's
decision in ASARCO, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 109 S.Ct. 2037,
104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). In ASARCO, numerous individual state taxpayers
and the Arizona Education Association, representing approximately
20,000 public *1402 school teachers in the State of Arizona, brought
a suit in Arizona state court seeking a declaration that a state
statute governing mineral leases on state land was void. The plaintiffs
challenged the state statute on grounds that it did not comply
with the methods Congress required the State to follow before
leasing or selling the lands granted by the United States in the
New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 557. Because
the state court interpreted federal law, the Court addressed whether
the plaintiffs would have had standing had the action originally
been brought in federal court.
<P>
The Court noted that the general bar on federal taxpayer suits
announced in Frothingham does not necessarily apply to municipal
taxpayers &quot;if it has been shown that the 'peculiar relation
of the corporate taxpayer to the [municipal] corporation' makes
the taxpayer's interest in the application of municipal revenues
'direct and immediate.' &quot; ASARCO, 109 S.Ct. at 2043 (quoting
Frothingham, 262 U.S. at 486-87, 43 S.Ct. at 600-01) (alteration
in original).
<P>
The Court then noted that &quot;we have likened state taxpayers
to federal taxpayers, and thus we have refused to confer standing
upon a state taxpayer absent a showing of 'direct injury,' pecuniary
or otherwise.&quot; Id. (quoting Doremus, 342 U.S. at 434, 72
S.Ct. at 397). The Court concluded that the state taxpayers were
not entitled to standing because &quot;[t]he possibility that
taxpayers will receive any direct pecuniary relief from this lawsuit
is 'remote, fluctuating and uncertain,' as stated in Frothingham,
supra, and consequently the claimed injury is not 'likely to be
redressed by a favorable decision.' &quot; Id. (quoting Valley
Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 758). (FN4)
<P>
After reviewing the reasoning in ASARCO, we conclude that we must
reject the Ninth Circuit's formulation of state taxpayer standing
because it equates state taxpayers with municipal taxpayers for
standing purposes. See Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770 (&quot;we conclude
that municipal taxpayer standing ... mirrors our threshold for
state taxpayer standing&quot;). Supreme Court jurisprudence indicates
that state taxpayers must be likened to federal taxpayers. Thus,
in addition to demonstrating that money was appropriated and spent
for an allegedly unlawful purpose, a state taxpayer must show
that a distinct and palpable injury resulted from the allegedly
illegal appropriation or expenditure. To show such an injury,
a state taxpayer must allege that he has suffered a monetary loss
due to the allegedly unlawful activity's effect on his tax liability.
(FN5)
<P>
Requiring a distinct and palpable injury for state taxpayers comports
with notions of federalism that are central to our system of government.
In the federal taxpayer standing cases, the Supreme Court has
restricted standing to prevent the judicial branch from intruding
into the provinces of the executive and the legislative branches.
We agree with the Sixth Circuit that [t]his separation of powers
concern has a counterpoint which should be considered when a state
taxpayer seeks to have a federal court enjoin the appropriation
and spending activities of a state government.
<P>
Considerations of federalism should signal the same caution in
these circumstances as concern for preservation of the proper
separation of powers in an &quot;all federal&quot; action.
<P>
Taub, 842 F.2d at 919. As the dissent in Hoohuli stated, *1403.
Doremus requires a state taxpayer plaintiff to demonstrate &quot;a
good-faith pocketbook action,&quot; which appears to parallel
the core article III injury-in-fact requirement. But when state
taxpayers attack state spending in federal court, another major
consideration operates: the integrity of our government's federalist
structure. Unnecessary or abstract decisions by federal courts
in cases where there is no case or controversy could unduly constrict
experimental state welfare legislation and undermine local self-determination.
<P>
Hoohuli, 741 F.2d at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting) (citations
omitted). In this case we have an especially compelling federalism
concern that dictates careful attention to the threshold case
or controversy requirement of standing. This case involves a citizen
initiative effort. The right to initiate legislation is a unique
state-created right. The allegations in this case suggest that
the elected chief executive officer of the state cannot take an
active official role in the state-created initiative process.
We can discern few areas so sacrosanct as protection of state
self-determination. The mere allegation of federal constitutional
violations cannot be allowed to clothe a state governmental decisionmaking
process with the ill-fitting garments of federal court scrutiny.
The &quot;direct injury&quot; requirement for standing that has
flourished since Frothingham and Doremus and that defines the
appropriate litigants in a state taxpayer case proves yet again
the wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution when they tied federal
court jurisdiction to the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement
and its attendant standing, ripeness, and mootness doctrines.
This case proves the continuing importance of judicial vigilance
over these time-tested doctrines. Absent such vigilance, we would
seriously undermine the constitutional commitment to federalism.
<P>
In this case, appellants allege that funds were appropriated and
spent for an unlawful purpose; however, they do not allege a distinct
and palpable injury that results from an increased tax liability.
Instead, appellants merely allege that the Governor's allegedly
illegal activities forced them to spend additional funds to offset
his efforts. &quot;[A] taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue
of his liability for taxes.&quot; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 478,
102 S.Ct. at 762. Appellants have not alleged that they have suffered
any injury whatsoever as a result of paying increased taxes to
fund the Governor's activities. Because appellants have not alleged
an injury related to tax liability, they have not shown that they
have suffered a distinct and palpable injury as a result of the
allegedly illegal appropriations or expenditures. Thus, the individual
appellants do not satisfy the good-faith pocketbook requirement
of Doremus and are not entitled to standing as state taxpayers.
Likewise, the Colorado Taxpayers Union lacks associational standing
because its members do not have standing as taxpayers to sue in
their own right. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441.
<P>
Accordingly, both the individuals and the two associations lack
standing to challenge the alleged illegality of the Governor's
activities. The appeal is DISMISSED.

Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, sitting by designation.

FN1. The Supreme Court has permitted federal taxpayer standing
when plaintiffs challenge that the administration of congressional
grants violates the Establishment Clause. See Roemer v. Board

because they did not demonstrate how the Hawaiian plan increases
the taxes they pay. Id. at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting). The

pocketbook injury, an &quot;especially acute&quot; dual federalism
issue would arise. Id.
<P>
FN3. In Cammack v. Waihee, the Ninth Circuit found that the same
standing requirements that apply to state taxpayers also apply
to municipal taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;[W]e conclude that municipal taxpayer standing simply requires
the 'injury' of an allegedly improper expenditure of municipal
funds, and in this way mirrors our threshold for state taxpayer
standing.&quot; Id. at 770.

*1403_ FN4. Justice Kennedy garnered only four votes for the portion
of the opinion that deals with state taxpayer standing. See ASARCO,
109 S.Ct. at 2053 (Brennan, J., concurring). Because Justice Brennan
believed that it was unnecessary to address the state taxpayer
standing issue, he did not concur in this part of Justice Kennedy's
decision. Justice O'Connor did not take part in the decision.
<P>
FN5. In ASARCO, the Court explained why the plaintiff-taxpayers
lacked standing:
<P>
[The taxpayers] have simply asserted that the Arizona statute
governing mineral leases has &quot;deprived the school trust funds
of millions of dollars thereby resulting in unnecessarily higher
taxes.&quot; Complaint, p III. Even if the first part of that
assertion were correct, however, it is pure speculation whether
the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for [the taxpayers].

<P>
OPINION
<P>
SPROUSE, Senior Circuit Judge:
<P>
George Mason University appeals from a summary judgment granted
by the district court to the IOTA XI Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity
(FN1) in its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction
seeking to nullify sanctions imposed on it by the University because
it conducted an &quot;ugly woman contest&quot; with racist and
sexist overtones. We affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
Sigma Chi has for two years held an annual &quot;Derby Days&quot;
event, planned and conducted both as entertainment and as a source
of funds for donations to charity. The &quot;ugly woman contest,&quot;
held on April 4, 1991, was one of the &quot;Derby Days&quot; events.
The Fraternity staged the contest in the cafeteria of the student
union. As part of the contest, eighteen Fraternity members were
assigned to one of six sorority teams cooperating in *388 the
events. The involved Fraternity members appeared in the contest
dressed as caricatures of different types of women, including
one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a black woman.
He was painted black and wore stringy, black hair decorated with
curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with pillows to exaggerate
a woman's breasts and buttocks. He spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.
<P>
There is no direct evidence in the record concerning the subjective
intent of the Fraternity members who conducted the contest. The
Fraternity, which later apologized to the University officials
for the presentation, conceded during the litigation that the
contest was sophomoric and offensive.
<P>
Following the contest, a number of students protested to the University
that the skit had been objectionably sexist and racist. Two hundred
forty-seven students, many of them members of the foreign or minority
student body, executed a petition, which stated: &quot;[W]e are
condemning the racist and sexist implications of this event in
which male members dressed as women. One man in particular wore
a black face, portraying a negative stereotype of black women.&quot;
<P>
On April 10, 1991, the Dean for Student Services, Kenneth Bumgarner,
discussed the situation with representatives of the objecting
students. That same day, Dean Bumgarner met with student representatives
of Sigma Chi, including the planners of and participants in the
&quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; He then held a meeting with members
of the student government and other student leaders. In this meeting,
it was agreed that Sigma Chi's behavior had created a hostile
learning environment for women and blacks, incompatible with the
University's mission.
<P>
The Dean met again with Fraternity representatives on April 18,
and the following day advised its officers of the sanctions imposed.
They included suspension from all activities for the rest of the
1991 spring semester and a two-year prohibition on all social
activities except pre-approved pledging events and pre-approved
philanthropic events with an educational purpose directly related
to gender discrimination and cultural diversity. The University's
sanctions also required Sigma Chi to plan and implement an educational
program addressing cultural differences, diversity, and the concerns
of women. A few weeks later, the University made minor modifications
to the sanctions, allowing Sigma Chi to engage in selected social
activities with the University's advance approval.
<P>
On June 5, 1991, Sigma Chi brought this action under 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 1983 (FN2) against the University and Dean Bumgarner. It
requested declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to nullify
the sanctions as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Sigma Chi moved for summary judgment on its First Amendment claims
on June 28, 1991, filing with its motions numerous affidavits
explaining the nature of the &quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; Also
submitted were large glossy photographs of the participants as
they appeared in the skits, including photographs of the Fraternity
member depicting the offensive caricature of the black woman.
<P>
In addition to the affidavit of Dean Bumgarner explaining his
meetings with student leaders, the University submitted the affidavits
of other officials, including that of University President George
W. Johnson and Vice-President Earl G. Ingram. President Johnson,
by his affidavit, presented the &quot;mission statement&quot;
of the University:
<P>
(3) George Mason University is committed to promoting a culturally
and racially diverse student body.... Education here is not limited
to the classroom.
<P>
(4) We are committed to teaching the values of equal opportunity
and equal treatment, respect for diversity, and individual dignity.
<P>
(5) Our mission also includes achieving the goals set forth in
our affirmative action *389 plan, a plan incorporating affirmative
steps designed to attract and retain minorities to this campus.
<P>
....
<P>
(7) George Mason University is a state institution of higher education
and a recipient of federal funds.
<P>
Vice President Earl G. Ingram's affidavit represented:
<P>
(6) The University's affirmative action plan is a part of an overall
state plan designed, in part, to desegregate the predominately
&quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; public institutions of
higher education in Virginia.... The behavior of the members of
Sigma Chi that led to this lawsuit was completely antithetical
to the University's mission, as expressed through its affirmative
action statement and other pertinent University policies, to create
a non-threatening, culturally diverse learning environment for
students of all races and backgrounds, and of both sexes.
<P>
(7) While the University has progressed in attracting and retaining
minority students, it cannot expect to maintain the position it
has achieved, and make further progress on affirmative action
and minority issues that it wishes to make, if behavior like that
of Sigma Chi is perpetuated on this campus.
<P>
The district court granted summary judgment to Sigma Chi on its
First
<P>
Amendment claim, 773 F.Supp. 792 (E.D.Va.1991).
<P>
II
<P>
The University urges that the district court's grant of summary
judgment was premature. It stresses that there remain factual
issues which the district court should have weighed in its conclusion.
According to the University, the Fraternity's intent in staging
the contest is crucial to the issue of whether its conduct was
expressive. The University also stresses that if given time it
could demonstrate more completely the harm the contest caused
to its educational mission. It is, of course, beyond cavil that
summary judgment should not be granted while a viable issue of
material fact remains. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment
principles require the court to find that the evidence is such
that a jury could not reasonably find for the party opposing summary
judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252,
106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Only disputes over
facts that might affect the outcome of a suit under the applicable
law preclude entry of summary judgment.
<P>
In our view, for the reasons that follow, the district court was
correct in concluding that there was no outstanding issue of material
fact.
<P>
III
<P>
We initially face the task of deciding whether Sigma Chi's &quot;ugly
woman contest&quot; is sufficiently expressive to entitle it to
First Amendment protection. From the mature advantage of looking
back, it is obvious that the performance, apart from its charitable
fund-raising features, was an exercise of teenage campus excess.
With a longer and sobering perspective brought on by both peer
and official disapproval, even the governing members of the Fraternity
recognized as much. The answer to the question of whether the
First Amendment protects the Fraternity's crude attempt at entertainment,
however, is all the more difficult because of its obvious sophomoric
nature.
<P>
A
<P>
First Amendment principles governing live entertainment are relatively
clear: short of obscenity, it is generally protected. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (nude dancing); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557-58, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1245-47,
43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (musical &quot;Hair&quot;); Berger v. Battaglia,
779 F.2d 992, 999 (4th Cir.1985) (blackface performance), cert.
denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
As the Supreme Court announced in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981), &quot;[e]ntertainment,
as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion
pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live
entertainment ... fall *390 within the First Amendment guarantee.&quot;
Id. at 65, 101 S.Ct. at 2180. Expression devoid of &quot;ideas&quot;
but with entertainment value may also be protected because &quot;[t]he
line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive.&quot;
<P>
Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 667, 92
L.Ed. 840 (1948).
<P>
Thus, we must determine if the skit performed by Sigma Chi comes
within the constitutionally protected rubric of entertainment.
Unquestionably, some forms of entertainment are so inherently
expressive as to fall within the First Amendment's ambit regardless
of their quality. For example, in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), the Supreme
Court flatly ruled that &quot;[m]usic, as a form of expression
and communication, is protected under the First Amendment.&quot;
Id. at 790, 109 S.Ct. at 2753. Justice Kennedy explained: Music
is one of the oldest forms of human expression. From Plato's discourse
in the Republic to the totalitarian state in our own times, rulers
have known its capacity to appeal to the intellect and to the
emotions, and have censored musical compositions to serve the
needs of the state. The Constitution prohibits any like attempts
in our own legal order.
<P>
Id. (citations omitted).
<P>
Motion pictures, too, are included within the free speech guarantee
of the First Amendment. The Court emphasized in Joseph Burstyn,
Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952),
that &quot;[t]he importance of motion pictures as an organ of
public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed
to entertain as well as to inform.&quot; Id. at 501, 72 S.Ct.
at 780; see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S.
50, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (motion picture
theaters involve communication protected by the First Amendment,
but the state can regulate their secondary effects).
<P>
Even crude street skits come within the First Amendment's reach.
In overturning the conviction of an amateur actor for wearing
a military uniform in violation of a federal statute, the Supreme
Court discussed the statute's &quot;theatrical production&quot;
exception. (FN3) Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62,
90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558-59, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970). Responding to the
Government's argument that the amateur skit was not a &quot;theatrical
production,&quot; Justice Black, writing for the majority, stated:
<P>
It may be that the performances were crude and amateurish and
perhaps unappealing, but the same thing can be said about many
theatrical performances. We cannot believe that when Congress
wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it intended
to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally
produced plays.
<P>
Id. Although this part of the opinion related to interpretation
of the involved statute, Justice Black proceeded to declare that
an actor participating in even a crude performance enjoys the
constitutional right to freedom of speech. Id. at 63, 90 S.Ct.
at 1559.
<P>
Bearing on this dichotomy between low and high-grade entertainment
are the Supreme Court's holdings relating to nude dancing. See
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. at ----, ----, 111 S.Ct.
2456, 2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough of Mount
Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d
671 (1981); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 932-33, 95
S.Ct. 2561, 2568-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); California v. LaRue,
409 U.S. 109, 116-18, 93 S.Ct. 390, 395-97, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972).
Most recently, in Barnes, the Supreme Court conceded that nude
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection.
(FN4) Barnes, --- U.S. at *391 111 S.Ct. at 2460. In Barnes, the
Court reviewed a Seventh Circuit opinion authored by Judge Flaum,
Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir.1990)
(en banc), rev'd sub nom. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), which thoroughly
analyzed the questions of whether and how nude dancing is expression
entitled to First Amendment protection. The Miller opinion noted
that dance is inherently expressive entertainment, as it conveys
emotions and ideas. Judge Flaum refused to distinguish &quot;high&quot;
art from &quot;low&quot; entertainment on the asserted basis that
low entertainment &quot;fail[s] to communicate a defined intellectual
thought.&quot; Id. at 1086. Applying the test enunciated in Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989), (FN5) he concluded that nude dancing communicated
a message of eroticism and sensuality, understood by its viewers
as such. Miller, 904 F.2d at 1087. Thus, notwithstanding its artistic
quality, nude dancing was sufficiently expressive to entitle it
to First Amendment protection. Justice White's dissent in Barnes
echoed Judge Flaum's opinion:
<P>
&quot;[W]hile the entertainment afforded by a nude ballet at Lincoln
Center to those who can pay the price may differ vastly in content
(as viewed by judges) or in quality (as viewed by critics), it
may not differ in substance from the dance viewed by the person
who ... wants some 'entertainment' with his beer or shot of rye.&quot;
<P>
Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2475, 115 L.Ed.2d at 529
(White, J., dissenting) (quoting Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, 501
F.2d 18, 21 n. 3 (2d Cir.1974), modified sub nom. Doran v. Salem
Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)).
<P>
In sum, although the Barnes plurality did not explore these views,
it appears that the low quality of entertainment does not necessarily
weigh in the First Amendment inquiry. It would seem, therefore,
that the Fraternity's skit, even as low-grade entertainment, was
inherently expressive and thus entitled to First Amendment protection.
See Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2460;
<P>
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746,
2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970).
<P>
B
<P>
The University nevertheless contends that discovery will demonstrate
that the contest does not merit characterization as a skit but
only as mindless fraternity fun, devoid of any artistic expression.
It argues further that entitlement to First Amendment protection
exists only if the production was intended to convey a message
likely to be understood by a particular audience. See Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). From the summary judgment record, the University insists,
it is impossible to discern the communicative intent necessary
to imbue the Fraternity's *392 conduct with a free speech component.
<P>
As indicated, we feel that the First Amendment protects the Fraternity's
skit because it is inherently expressive entertainment. Even if
this were not true, however, the skit, in our view, qualifies
as expressive conduct under the test articulated in Texas v. Johnson.
It is true that the Johnson test for determining the expressiveness
of conduct requires &quot; '[a]n intent to convey a particularized
message' &quot; and a great likelihood &quot; 'that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.' &quot; Id. (quoting
Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730,
41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). As Johnson and Spence point out, however,
the intent to convey a message can be inferred from the conduct
and the circumstances surrounding it. Thus viewed, the University's
argument is self-defeating. The affidavit from the University's
Vice-President, Earl Ingram, stated that the message conveyed
by the Fraternity's conduct--that racial and sexual themes should
be treated lightly--was completely antithetical to the University's
mission of promoting diversity and providing an educational environment
free from racism and sexism.
<P>
Dean Bumgarner, in his affidavit, stated that the University does
not and cannot condone this type of on-campus behavior which perpetuated
derogatory racial and sexual stereotypes, tends to isolate minority
students, and creates a hostile and distracting learning environment.
Such behavior is incompatible with, and destructive to, the University's
mission of promoting diversity within its student body [and] sends
a message to the student body and the community that we ... are
not serious about hurtful and offensive behavior on campus.
<P>
Importantly, the affidavits establish that the punishment was
meted out to the Fraternity because its boorish message had interfered
with the described University mission. It is manifest from these
circumstances that the University officials thought the Fraternity
intended to convey a message. The Fraternity members' apology
and post-conduct contriteness suggest that they held the same
view. To be sure, no evidence suggests that the Fraternity advocated
segregation or inferior social status for women. What is evident
is that the Fraternity's purposefully nonsensical treatment of
sexual and racial themes was intended to impart a message that
the University's concerns, in the Fraternity's view, should be
treated humorously. From the Fraternity's conduct and the circumstances
surrounding it, we have no difficulty in concluding that it intended
to convey a message.
<P>
As to the second prong of the Johnson test, there was a great
likelihood that at least some of the audience viewing the skit
would understand the Fraternity's message of satire and humor.
Some students paid to attend the performance and were entertained.
What the Fraternity did not anticipate was the reaction to their
crude humor by other students on campus and University officials
who opposed the racist and sexist implications of the Fraternity's
skit.
<P>
Even considering, therefore, the sparsity of the evidentiary record,
we are persuaded that the Fraternity's &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
satisfies the Johnson test for expressive conduct. (FN6)
<P>
IV
<P>
If this were not a sufficient response to the University's argument,
the principles relating to content and viewpoint discrimination
recently emphasized in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), provide a definitive answer.
Although the Court in St. Paul reviewed the constitutional effect
of a city &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance, and we review the
constitutionality of sanctions imposed for violating University
policy, St. Paul 's rationale applies here with equal force. Noting
that St. Paul's city ordinance prohibited displays *393 of symbols
that &quot;arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; but did
not prohibit displays of symbols which would advance ideas of
racial or religious equality, Justice Scalia stated: &quot;The
First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special prohibitions
on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.&quot;
Id. at ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2541, 2547.
<P>
As evidenced by their affidavits, University officials sanctioned
Sigma Chi for the message conveyed by the &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
because it ran counter to the views the University sought to communicate
to its students and the community. (FN7) The mischief was the
University's punishment of those who scoffed at its goals of racial
integration and gender neutrality, while permitting, even encouraging,
conduct that would further the viewpoint expressed in the University's
goals and probably embraced by a majority of society as well.
&quot;The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
... expressive conduct because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.&quot;
Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2542 (citing Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406,
109 S.Ct. at 2540).
<P>
The University, however, urges us to weigh Sigma Chi's conduct
against the substantial interests inherent in educational endeavors.
See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S.
503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). The University certainly
has a substantial interest in maintaining an educational environment
free of discrimination and racism, and in providing gender-neutral
education. Yet it seems equally apparent that it has available
numerous alternatives to imposing punishment on students based
on the viewpoints they express. (FN8) We agree wholeheartedly
that it is the University officials' responsibility, even their
obligation, to achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand,
a public university has many constitutionally permissible means
to protect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as
have other courts, that &quot;the manner of [its action] cannot
consist of selective limitations upon speech.&quot; St. Paul,
--- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2548; see also Carey v. Brown,
447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (invalidating
a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (invalidating a law that allowed wearing
military uniforms only in dramatic portrayals that did not &quot;tend
to discredit the military&quot;). The First Amendment forbids
the government from &quot;restrict[ing] expression because of
its message [or] its ideas.&quot; Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408
U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). The University
should have accomplished its goals in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its viewpoint.
<P>
The decision of the district court is affirmed.
<P>
AFFIRMED.
<P>
MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in judgment:
<P>
While I agree with the majority's affirmance of the district court's
grant of summary judgment, I feel that its reasoning goes unnecessarily
too far. By holding that the First Amendment prohibits any action
by a public university to prevent or punish offensive conduct
like that at issue, the majority *394 goes much further than necessary,
going beyond the facts of the instant case in order to reach a
conclusion unsupported by First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
The present case can be decided easily within the contours of
First Amendment law simply by holding that George Mason University's
action violated the Fraternity members' rights by punishing them
post hoc and in conflict with its tacit approval of their performance.
Instead, the majority ranges far to discuss what it has concluded
the law would be absent such permission. The majority opinion
expounds upon the development of First Amendment doctrine and
concludes that George Mason was absolutely forbidden from regulating
speech based on its content. However, the Supreme Court has held
repeatedly that a content-based regulation of protected expression
survives judicial scrutiny if it &quot; 'is necessary to serve
a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. New York Crime Victims
Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). Accord
Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983);
<P>
Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
Thus, the Supreme Court has recognized that regulation of speech
based on its content is not only permissible but, in limited circumstances,
justified.
<P>
In an attempt to reach a much broader conclusion, the majority
cites from Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95,
92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Yet, the quoted passage
from Mosley misrepresents its holding. The Mosley Court did not
rule that Chicago's selective proscription of nonlabor picketing
was per se unconstitutional, but rather indicated that the regulation
would be valid if Chicago demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
408 U.S. at 100, 92 S.Ct. at 2292. A complete reading of First
Amendment jurisprudence reveals &quot;that content-based distinctions,
far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable and indispensable
aspect of a coherent understanding of the First Amendment.&quot;
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2563,
120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (Stevens, J. concurring).
<P>
George Mason's treatment of the Fraternity is not itself constitutionally
flawed, because the University was concerned about the message
of the students' performance, but because of the permission to
give the performance which the University granted. The University,
following the Fraternity's performance of the skit, meted out
punishment to the Fraternity, without any prior indication that
such behavior was not allowed at school-sanctioned events, and
despite indicating that the Fraternity's skit had University approval.
<P>
Actually, forbidding the skit or requiring substantial amendment
was not beyond its power. The University does have greater authority
to regulate expressive conduct within its confines as a result
of the unique nature of the educational forum. Tinker v. Des Moines
School District, 393 U.S. 503, 513, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d
731 (1969) (holding that expressive activity in a school setting
can only be restricted if it &quot;materially disrupts classwork
or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of
others&quot;); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.
104, 117-118, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2304, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (stating
that the Court had never &quot;suggested that students, teachers,
or anyone else has an absolute right to use all parts of a school
building or its immediate environs for his [or her] unlimited
expressive purposes&quot;); cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
276-277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981).
<P>
In Widmar, Justice Stevens, concurring in judgment, has provided
an insightful analysis of the special character of institutions
of higher education:
<P>
Today most major colleges and universities are operated by public
authority. Nevertheless, their facilities are not open to the
public in the same way that streets and parks are. University
facilities--private or public--are maintained primarily for the
benefit of the student body and the  faculty. In performing their
learning and *395. teaching missions, the managers of a university
routinely make countless decisions based on the content of communicative
materials. They select books for inclusion in the library, they
hire professors on the basis of their academic philosophies, they
select courses for inclusion in the curriculum, and they reward
scholars for what they have written. In addition, encouraging
students to participate in extracurricular activities, they necessarily
make decisions concerning the content of those activities.
<P>
454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). In the present case, the University, by officially
recognizing Greek-letter social organizations and participating
in the planning of their events, inevitably has participated in
the activities of those groups. Therefore, it must retain the
ability to refuse to sanction certain behavior which infringes
on the rights of other students. The University need not allow
activity distinctly injurious to its objectives.
<P>
Certainly, the most fundamental concern of a university is to
provide the optimum conditions for learning. The majority concedes
that &quot;the University certainly has a substantial interest
in maintaining an educational environment free of discrimination
and racism, and in providing gender-neutral education.&quot; Therefore,
the University must have some leeway to regulate conduct which
counters that interest, and thereby infringes upon the right of
other students to learn. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct.
at 740; cf. R.A.V., --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2565 (Stevens,
J. concurring) (&quot;A selective proscription of unprotected
expression designed to protect 'certain persons or groups' would
be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate determination
that the harm created by the regulated expression differs from
that created by the unregulated expression.&quot;).
<P>
By concluding that a university must be allowed to regulate expressive
conduct which runs directly counter to its mission, I do not mean
to imply that a university has the unrestricted power to silence
entirely certain perspectives. I wholeheartedly believe that the
free exchange of ideas and debate are fundamental to a place of
learning. Yet, they comprise only part of a university's mission
and must be balanced against a university's other interests, especially
those interests which rise to the level of constitutional significance.
(FN*)
<P>
Moreover, if the University, in advance, had refused to allow
the Fraternity to perform its intended skit, the marketplace of
ideas would hardly have been endangered. The Fraternity, if it
wished, could have presented its ideas and perspectives on the
value of women and Blacks in an open debate, allowing other students
to challenge its perspective.
<P>
All in all, my concurrence rests on the unrevoked permission to
give the skit. I find it unnecessary, and of doubtful validity,
to suggest that, regardless of such approval, there was any First
Amendment provision guaranteeing the right to give the skit, in
circumstances under which it was inextricably linked with George
Mason University.
<P>
FN1. Although Sigma Chi's national fraternity is not involved
in the litigation, the IOTA Chapter XI is hereafter referred to
as &quot;Sigma Chi&quot; or &quot;the Fraternity.&quot;
<P>
FN2. Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the
District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any
citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party
injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding
for redress....
<P>
42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
FN3. 10 U.S.C. Sec. 772(f) provides:
<P>
While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine
Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production may
wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not
tend to discredit that armed force.
<P>
FN4. At least eight justices agreed that First Amendment protection
extends to nude dancing, but they differed in their approaches
to defining that protection. Justice Rehnquist, writing for a
plurality, relied on the four-part test announced in United States
v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
He concluded that the Indiana statute prohibiting public nudity
was constitutional because it was unrelated to the suppression
of speech, infringed only incidentally on protected expression,
and furthered the important government interest of prohibiting
public nudity. Justice Scalia concurred in the result, but wrote
separately because he believed the statute regulated conduct,
not expression. Justice Souter also wrote separately because he
believed that the state's interest was to combat secondary effects,
an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.
<P>
Justice White, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens,
dissented, stating that the Indiana statute targeted the erotic
message communicated by nude dancing. He would have applied a
higher standard of scrutiny than the O'Brien test requires. *395_
<P>
Because the sanctions imposed in this case targeted the message
communicated by Sigma Chi's skit and are thus related to the suppression
of speech, we do not rely on the O'Brien balancing test as the
Barnes plurality did.
<P>
FN5. In Texas v. Johnson, discussed infra, the Supreme Court stated:
<P>
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative
elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked
whether &quot;[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was
present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.&quot;
<P>
Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404, 109 S.Ct. at 2539 (quoting Spence v.
Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d
842 (1974)). FN6. We think this conclusion gains support from
City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750,
108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), in which the Supreme Court
said that one factor weighing in the equation of whether conduct
is expressive is &quot;whether the activity in question is commonly
associated with expression.&quot; Id. at 769, 108 S.Ct. at 2150.
A live, albeit crude, skit performed for an audience is an activity
commonly associated with expression.
<P>
FN7. Nor can we accept the University's contention that the sanctions
were imposed as a result of the Fraternity's &quot;pure conduct,&quot;
unrelated to its communicative aspects or viewpoint. See Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 702-05, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 3175-77,
92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986); Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U.S. 288, 293 &amp; n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069 &amp; n. 5,
82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367,
376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Kovacs v. Cooper,
336 U.S. 77, 89, 69 S.Ct. 448, 454, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). The University's
affidavits clearly point to the contrary conclusion.
<P>
FN8. In St. Paul, the Court rejected the Minnesota Supreme Court's
pronouncement that St. Paul's &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance
was narrowly tailored to serve St. Paul's compelling interest
in &quot;ensur[ing] the basic human rights of members of groups
that ha[d] historically been subjected to discrimination.&quot;
St. Paul, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2549. Although the Court
acknowledged that this interest was compelling, it concluded that
the content discrimination contained in the ordinance was not
&quot;reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests.&quot;
Id.
<P>
FN* In a case decided one month prior to R.A.V., the Supreme Court
noted that among the most difficult First Amendment cases were
those requiring a reconciliation of our commitment to free speech
with our commitment to other constitutional rights. Burson v.
Freeman, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1851, 119 L.Ed.2d
5 (1992). In Burson, the Court ultimately upheld the content-based
regulation, namely, a Tennessee law prohibiting election-day political
speeches within 100 feet of a polling place, holding that the
State's interest in protecting the right to vote was sufficiently
compelling.

v.
<P>

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
HILTON, District Judge.
<P>
This matter comes before the court on plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and defendants' motion to dismiss. In this action, the
plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for George Mason
University's imposition of discipline on the plaintiff fraternity
which has allegedly abridged the plaintiffs' right of free speech.
Plaintiffs argue that the discipline imposed upon *793 them unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First Amendment. Defendants
contend that the plaintiffs' conduct was not protected speech
and that if protected speech, George Mason University has compelling
educational interests at stake which justify the discipline imposed
on plaintiffs.
<P>
This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. This court
has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1331 and 1343 and may give declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 2201. The plaintiffs in this action are the Iota Xi Chapter
of Sigma Chi Fraternity which is at George Mason University (GMU)
and two members of the fraternity, the president and the immediate
past president of the chapter. Defendant GMU is a public university
maintained and funded in significant part by the Commonwealth
of Virginia which was acting as an educational institution at
all relevant times. Defendant Dean Bumgarner is the associate
vice president and dean of student services at GMU who was acting
on behalf of GMU at all relevant times.
<P>
For the past two years, a week long event known as Derby Days
has been held at GMU by the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi. Derby
Days is a major social event for the chapter and is held to raise
money for charity. One event during Derby Days has traditionally
been the &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; contest in which members of the
fraternity dress as caricatures of &quot;ugly women&quot;.
<P>
During the week of March 11, 1991, Dominic Lapus, an Iota Xi chapter
member acting as co-chair of the 1991 Derby Days program, submitted
the printed Derby Days program for approval to Kathryn Schilling,
GMU's assistant director of student organizations and programs.
The program listed the following as one event: &quot;Dress a SIG
contest (dress coaches like ugly women.)&quot;. As in former years,
university approval was sought. Ms. Schilling approved the Derby
Days program on behalf of the university, after requiring numerous
changes to be made in the proposed program. She required no changes
whatsoever to be made relative to the proposed &quot;ugly woman&quot;
contest.
<P>
The &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; event took place on April 4, 1991
in the cafeteria of the student union building on the campus of
GMU. In that event, one of the participants dressed in black face,
used pillows to represent breasts and buttocks and wore a black
wig with curlers. One week later, several GMU student leaders
signed a letter to Dean Bumgarner requesting the imposition of
sanctions on the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi as the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest had offended them because it perpetuated racial
and sexual stereotypes. On April 19, 1991 Dean Bumgarner announced
the proposed discipline and clarified that discipline in a letter
on May 1, 1991. The discipline imposed by Dean Bumgarner and GMU
prevents the plaintiffs from holding social and sports activities
for a two year probationary period and, during that same period,
requires the chapter to submit other planned activities to the
university for advance approval.
<P>
Plaintiffs and defendants agree that the First Amendment claims
are ripe for summary judgment. As there are no material facts
in dispute on the First Amendment claims, it is proper to resolve
this issue on summary judgment.
<P>
One of the fundamental rights secured by the First Amendment is
that of free, uncensored expression, even on matters some may
think are trivial, vulgar or profane. Berger v. Battaglia, 779
F.2d 992, 1000 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106
S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986). Because that fundamental right
extends to students at a state university, a state university
may not hinder the exercise of First Amendment rights simply because
it feels that exposure to a given group's ideas may be somehow
harmful to certain students. Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews,
544 F.2d 162, 166 (4th Cir.1976); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
187-88, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2349-50, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).
<P>
Plaintiffs assert that the discipline imposed by GMU unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First *794 Amendment. Defendants,
however, argue that the behavior of the plaintiffs at the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest was not expressive and therefore, not protected
speech. Defendants contend that only political and social speech
are protected by the First Amendment and that this conduct is
neither. However, the Supreme Court has held that activity such
as nude dancing and performance in black face are protected expression
under the First Amendment. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough
of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Berger v. Battaglia, 779 F.2d 992 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied,
476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).

In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), Indiana enforced a public indecency law
which prevented the respondent establishments from providing totally
nude dancing as entertainment. Although nude dancing was protected
by the First Amendment, the Court held that the Indiana public
indecency law was permissible. The Court found that the Indiana
law sought to regulate conduct, specifically public nudity, and
not an expressive message. 111 S.Ct. at 2463. The Court noted
that &quot; 'It is possible to find some kernel of expression
in almost every activity a person undertakes ... but such a kernel
is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection
of the First Amendment.' &quot; Id. at 2462 (quoting Dallas v.
Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18
(1989)).
<P>
In this case, however, GMU did not seek to regulate any conduct
whatsoever. It was not the conduct of renting the auditorium,
holding Derby Days, raising money for charity, providing entertainment,
or performing a skit which prompted GMU to discipline the members
of Sigma Chi. To the contrary, it was the expressive message conveyed
by the skit which was perceived as offensive by several student
groups which prompted GMU to discipline the fraternity. This skit
contained more than a kernel of expression; therefore, the activity
demands First Amendment protection.
<P>
Even if the activity is protected, the defendants contend that
any infringement on the First Amendment rights of the Sigma Chi
fraternity is permissible because compelling educational interests
are at stake. In particular, the defendants assert that Sigma
Chi's behavior undermines the education of minority and women
students, the university's mission to promote learning through
a culturally diverse student body, the university's mission to
eliminate racist and sexist behavior on campus and the university's
mission to accomplish maximal desegregation of its student body.
Although the university has these interests, there has been no
substantial or material disruption of GMU's educational mission.
See Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 106
S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Crosby v. Holsinger, 852
F.2d 801 (4th Cir.1988). The student activity at issue in this
action is consistent with GMU's educational mission in conveying
ideas and promoting the free flow and expression of those ideas.
<P>
Furthermore, defendants have only alleged general, unspecified
claims of harm to the students who were exposed to the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. &quot;The First Amendment does not guarantee
that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such
as the principle that discrimination based on race is odious and
destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas.&quot;
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2546, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Berger v. Battaglia
a more appropriate response to the activities of the fraternity,
and one consistent with the First Amendment &quot;would have been
instead to say to those offended by ... [the] speech that their
right to protest that speech by all peaceable means would be as
stringently safeguarded ... as would ... [the] right to engage
in it.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001.
<P>
Defendants also raise the issue of whether or not the cafeteria
auditorium used by the plaintiffs is a public forum. However,
that is not a compelling issue since GMU *795. permits the cafeteria
auditorium to be used upon written application by student groups
to hold charity events and to perform skits. In fact, GMU approved
the plaintiffs' application to use the cafeteria auditorium on
April 4, 1991.
<P>
Although appropriate time, place and manner restrictions on free
expression are permissible, a state university may not suppress
expression because it finds that expression offensive. See Piarowski
v. Illinois Community College, 759 F.2d 625, 630 (7th Cir.) (racially
and sexually offensive art work not subject to outright suppression
by state school), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 528,
88 L.Ed.2d 460 (1985). In this instance GMU has disciplined the
members of Sigma Chi because the activity was deemed offensive
by them and not because the members violated any time, place or
manner regulations imposed by the university on the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. In fact, Sigma Chi submitted a copy of a
schedule of proposed events for Derby Days, including the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; event, to the assistant director of student organizations
and programs at GMU. At that time no objections to the event were
made by GMU. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying
the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea
itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 109
S.Ct. at 2544. The First Amendment does not recognize exceptions
for bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance or ideas or matters
some may deem trivial, vulgar or profane.
<P>
Plaintiffs' expression occurred at a charity social event in the
cafeteria of the student union before an audience composed of
students and non-students who paid money to witness a performance.
Although the university disagreed with the message propounded
by the fraternity's activity, GMU may not discipline the students
by infringing on their First Amendment rights based on the perceived
offensive content of the activity. &quot;[O]ne of the most persistent
and insidious threats to first amendment rights has been that
posed by the 'heckler's veto,' imposed by the successful importuning
of government to curtail 'offensive' speech at peril of suffering
disruptions of public order.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001 (citations
omitted). In this instance, GMU sought to discipline the students
based precisely on the &quot;heckler's veto&quot;. That is not
permissible.
<P>
The court need not reach the defendants' motion to dismiss as
this summary judgment motion is dispositive. Summary judgment
is granted in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants are enjoined
from imposing any discipline on the plaintiffs as a result of
the activity of April 4, 1991.

Baden</P><P>IS economics an enemy of ecology? Many environmentalists seem to think so. They portray economists as insensitive number crunchers with Republican leanings, people stricken by a ghoulish preference for money over ecological integrity. The perceived focus of economics - money, business and mathematics - is distasteful to people motivated by environmental concerns.</P><P>       But greens' conventional wisdom is wrong. Economic analysis can be environmentalism's best tool. By considering how economics can further environmental objectives, we may be able to alleviate greens' allergy to economics.</P><P>     Since most resources are scarce, we lose opportunities if we fail to minimize waste. Tumbleweeds in Arizona, spotted knapweed in Montana and bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture are so overabundant that they are &quot;bads&quot; - not goods. Items we value should be treated as though they are scarce.</P><P>     When environmental policies waste talent, time or material, the price of environmental protection is higher than necessary. The economist's &quot;first law of demand,&quot; a social analog to the law of gravity, states that as the price of a good rises, demand falls. Making environmental quality needlessly expensive subverts environmental goals because the expense lowers people's demand for environmental protection. Americans' growing opposition to needlessly expensive Superfund sites is just one example.</P><P>     To make the most of limited environmental dollars and to achieve real improvements in pollution control, watershed protection and other important goals, we should first address those problems where the payoffs are greatest per dollar invested. This requires risk-benefit analysis, a method of comparing values (lives, endangered species) that can be saved by investing resources on different problems. Not all activities generate equal benefits. Since we can't do everything, risk-benefit analysis helps us choose among our options.</P><P>     Greens have shown a curious reluctance to accept risk analysis. Some groups have included it in the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of principles they oppose in environmental legislation.</P><P>     But, in terms of achieving green values, environmentalists are misguided when they reject risk analysis. Eliminating some very expensive regulations would save lives or improve health if we thereby free up resources enabling people to achieve less-onerous environmental objectives. Eliminating extremely costly regulations also increases incomes, saving roughly one life for every $7.5 million added to our economy. Richer really is safer and cleaner.</P><P>     Risk analysis is one way to get more for our environmental efforts. Another is minimizing government micromanagement. When government agencies try to specify how people are to reach environmental objectives, waste and ineffective policies are the predictable result.</P><P>     Consider the case of the Amoco Corporation's Yorktown, Va., oil refinery. Amoco and the EPA conducted a two-year joint study into how chemical emissions from the Yorktown plant were addressed by existing regulations. They found that EPA regulations required pollution controls that ignored major sources of pollution and were roughly $30 million more expensive than the more-effective approaches uncovered by the study. Amoco's costs were nearly four times greater than needed to achieve regulatory goals, $41 million versus $11 million. Nevertheless, existing regulations disallow the more-efficient strategies.</P><P>     The Yorktown case illustrates problems endemic to national environmental regulations. Sweeping, undifferentiated regulations are necessarily inflexible, excessively costly, and do little to control pollution. They make few allowances for local situations. Like the Forest Service, BLM and other large centralized bureaucracies, the EPA's regulations are at odds with the ecology of particular places.</P><P>     Thoughtful risk analysis and the end of regulatory micromanagement can yield better and less-expensive environmental protection.</P><P>     Some environmental organizations, such as Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Defense Fund, are pursuing principled, innovative and constructive policies. However, the leaders of other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, see a niche in crisis entrepreneurship. They use shoddy science and biased media coverage to exaggerate (as with chlorine) or fabricate (as with Alar) environmental dangers. These efforts pressure government officials to adopt wasteful policies.</P><P>     By exaggerating environmental dangers, and posturing as the great green hope with full-page ads in The New York Times, crisis entrepreneurs seduce members and donations. Their budgets, professional status and political influence may increase in the short run. But environmental protection is lost and ethical standards are eroded. Ultimately, the credibility of the environmental movement is reduced.</P><P>     Economics does not offer a cure-all. Environmental quality implies real changes and real costs. But economics helps us better use our scarce efforts to craft effective policies. It exposes those seeking to use the public's interest in environmental protection for private ends. This is why some fear the use of environmental economics.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

<h3>William J. Bennett Discusses Abortion Controversy</h3> 
 
 
<b>Address to the Catholic Campaign for America 
<br>Washington, D.C.</b> 
<P><i>November 17, 1995</i></center><P>
<hr> 
<P> 
	As Catholics of the Catholic Campaign for America, we must address without hesitation, and 
with proper moral seriousness, the issue of abortion in America.  One and a half million 
abortions performed every year -- of which the overwhelming majority are performed on 
perfectly healthy women in order to prevent the births of perfectly healthy children -- is a 
national shame and a national catastrophe.   
<P> 
	But not only is this catastrophic in itself -- indeed, it is virtually a definition of catastrophe -- 
it is also horrible in its consequences on the sensibilities of the American people.  There is 
little doubt that the 30 million abortions since 1973 have had a coarsening effect on a people's 
attitudes toward its children; it has diminished our sense of natality.  And it has accelerated 
the growth of what Pope John Paul  II has correctly called the "culture of death." 
<P> 
	In addressing the abortion issue, we should never abandon principle.  We should invite as 
many people as possible to the affirmation of our clear end: significant reduction of the 
number of abortions.   
<P> 
	But reasonable people of good will can and do disagree on the <i>means</i> to reducing 
abortions.  Some would push for various forms of criminalization, some would not. Some 
believe a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is the surest and best way to go; 
others, in good faith, doubt this.  Differences aside, it seems to me we ought to bring to the 
cause all those who look at the figure of one and a half million abortions a year with horror 
and misgiving.  We can admit that yes, there are some hard, wrenching cases, cases on which 
people of good will disagree.  But let us set aside the small number of hard cases and focus 
our efforts on the vast majority of cases on which most Americans do not feel moral 
ambiguity. 
<P> 
	My own view is this:  I believe <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was wrongly decided and based on  
flawed legal reasoning;  I support legislative efforts to expand the boundaries of legal 
protection for the unborn (such as waiting periods, parental notification, restriction of 
abortions after viability, and other such measures); I oppose the use of public funds to pay for 
abortion;  and I strongly support pro-life alternatives such as adoption and abstinence. 
<P>
	As for the specific issue of a constitutional amendment, I know many people feel strongly 
about it.  But for myself, I do not think it has done much good, and I also believe there may 
well be drawbacks to it.  Above all, I believe it has done nothing to help reduce the number of 
abortions.  And that is, after all, the crucial issue in this debate: <i>how to reduce the number 
of abortions in America</i>.	 
<P> 
	Abortion is a moral issue and the law should reflect that fact.  Current law refuses to 
demonstrate to people that abortion is even a serious issue, much less a moral one.  Our efforts 
should be to infuse into the law a heightened sense of the spiritual and human dimensions of 
the issue.  Provisions which highlight and stress the morality of the issue -- waiting periods, 
information about fetal life and possible consequences for the mother, and parental 
notification among others -- should be pursued vigorously, on the state level.  And the recent 
effort to ban partial-birth abortions seems to me both tactically smart and morally sound. 
<P> 
	I believe that there is a pro-life agenda that is both incremental <i>and</i> principled, 
politically realistic <i>and</i> ambitious.  Our nation, as it is today, will sustain certain legal 
reforms: ending late-term abortions and sex selection abortions; promoting informed consent; 
and requiring parental notification to end the desperate isolation of pregnant teens and to 
promote responsibility, communication, and mature decision making.  That is where we ought 
to concentrate our legal efforts. 
<P> 
	I recognize that some pro-life groups will consider this kind of incremental approach as too 
little.  To which I respond: the approach I am advocating recognizes that social reform must 
respect political realities if we hope to restrict abortion-on-demand.  "Public sentiment is 
everything," Lincoln said of American democracy.  "With public sentiment, nothing can fail; 
without it, nothing can succeed.  Consequently, he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper 
than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes and decisions 
possible or impossible to be executed."  
<P> 
	I believe this type of pro-life movement would find the support of the majority of Americans -
- including many Democrats who are deeply troubled by the massive number of abortions 
which take place every year.    
<P> 
	There is an instructive historical analogy to which we can turn.  Research by Professor Marvin 
Olasky (author of <i>Abortion Rites: A Social History of Abortion in America</i>) has 
revealed something that most Americans on both sides of the abortion debate do not 
understand.  At the outset of the Civil War the abortion rate, in a smaller U.S. population, was 
almost exactly what it is today.  A pro-life movement, based in a network of shelters, began to 
actively oppose abortion by providing refuge to women in trouble.  Institutions like YWCA, 
the Salvation Army, and Florence Crittenton homes concentrated their efforts among 
prostitutes and young, urban women, impregnated and abandoned.  These activists worked for 
small victories, provided women with positive, pro-life alternatives to abortion, and fought for 
laws while not making them their primary focus.  The result?  Between 1860 and 1910, this 
steady, compassionate social pressure reduced the rate of abortions by over half.  And the rate 
stayed low until about 1960.  This model -- what Olasky refers to as "containment" as a way 
to achieve "roll back" -- is precisely the model anti-abortion advocates should look to and 
learn from.  It is politically viable and ultimately more effective and life-affirming. 
<P> 
	In another historical analogy, some have compared abortion in this century with slavery a 
century-and-a-half ago.  Many defenders of the rights of blacks had differing views on which 
specific efforts to abolish slavery in a democratic republic would prove most expedient, 
prudent,  and fruitful.  These were passionate debates about an important issue.  I believe the 
course of action chosen by abolitionists like Harriet Tubman offers greater promise than the 
course chosen by John Brown.  Again, I think we could learn much from Lincoln -- who 
proposed containing slavery so as to put it on the path to extinction.  The spirit of both Harriet 
Tubman and Abraham Lincoln would well serve the pro-life movement today. 
<P> 
	Finally, I want to express my deep respect for the pro-life people who have labored long and 
hard and selflessly on behalf of the unborn.  I am speaking here of the people in the crisis 
pregnancy centers, adoption agencies, and foster homes around this country.  Their work is 
among the most admirable in the nation.  These are the people who are doing the most to 
contain and reduce the numbers of abortion in America.  They are unsung heroes of our 
Republic.  It is time we give them the praise they deserve.

<p>
<center><h3>How Capitalism is Capitalized</h3> 
Letter to the Editor of the <i>Washington Post</i><P>
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>December 2, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
Dear Editor:
<P>
John Berry's November 9 Trendlines article, &quot;Treasury Argues
That the Tax Bite on Capital Isn't So Bad,&quot; reveals the ignorance
of our Treasury Department with regard to the workings of capitalism.
 The core of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' argument
is that declining inflation since the early 1980s has reduced
the tax burden on corporate profits.  But corporate profits taxes
are taxes on income, not capital.  Income can only be derived
from businesses that have already raised capital.  Companies reporting
substantial profits, such as those listed on Fortune 500, are
often established firms in mature markets.  Many are &quot;cash
cows&quot; that transfer wealth from capital to income because
they have exhausted their opportunities for successful risk taking.
 The fact that such firms are shouldering a lighter tax burden
with the decline of inflation tells us nothing about the &quot;tax
bite&quot; on capital.
<P>
The fact is, at a nominal rate of 28%, the capital gains tax has
stood at an historic high in the U.S. since 1987.  That's because
without inflation-indexing, the real rate can easily exceed 100%
on long-held assets that have merely earned a market-based rate
of return.  This high unindexed capital gains tax shuts off capital
to all but the least risky ventures, discouraging entrepreneurship
and thus producing sub-optimal economic growth.  That may be fine
for the large, established, risk-averse corporations throwing
off the cash that Larry Summers is proud to say is suffering lighter
tax burdens in a low-inflation environment.  But it offers scant
hope to our inner-cities and other capital-starved communities
that would have the most to gain from a rebirth of the entrepreneurial
spirit.  That's why I strongly urge congressional leaders and
the White House to include in their budgetary agreement a measure
to lower and index capital gains tax rates. 

<P><P>

<h2>Shut the Criminals' Revolving Door</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 16, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 
<i>Influenced by those opposed to punishment, government has failed to keep citizens safe from known repeat violent offenders.</i><P>

<P>
During the past 25 years, much of the crime debate has been dominated by criminologists who are philosophically opposed to punishment. In an attempt to advance their agenda, they have perpetrated a wide array of myths. The recently released report of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America is an attempt to provide an alternative: a rigorous, empirical, real-world analysis of the current state of crime and punishment.

The report tells us that the nation faces at least three distinct but related crime challenges: preventing at-risk children from becoming criminals, protecting innocent people from becoming crime victims and restraining convicted criminals who are under the "supervision" of the criminal justice system (on probation, parole or pretrial release) from committing additional crimes.
<P>
<b>Prevention.</b> We know that children born into poor families-- matter their race, region, religion, demographic stripe or socioeconomic status-- they have decent families and grow up with responsible, caring adults in their lives, are far less likely to become either victims or victimizers. We also know that not all children are born so lucky.
<P>
America is now home to nearly 70 million children 18 or under. As many as 15 million of them are growing up in relative poverty, often in places where the institutions of civil society--families, churches, schools, voluntary associations--are in near-complete collapse. The report argues that neither more spending by government nor the mere withdrawal of government can prevent today's at-risk 4- to 7-year-old boys from becoming next decade's 14- to 17-year-old predatory street felons or the next century's first big class of adult career criminals. The key to prevention is moral education. That, in turn, depends on reviving the character-forming institutions of civil society. But we know that there is no easy way to accomplish that.
<P>
<b>Protection.</b> The recent widely reported drops in serious crime in New York, Houston and other cities were due largely to innovative community policing strategies, citizen anti-crime initiatives and continued "target-hardening" or increased security and personal safety measures by individuals and businesses. But these drops in crime may be merely a lull. The storm is gathering in the form of a demographic bulge of highly crime-prone boys. During the next 10 years, enormous upward pressure will be exerted on crime rates. Redoubling crime protection efforts will not keep the storm offshore. But it can help to minimize the damage and reduce the human and financial cost.
<P>
<b>Restraint.</b> The criminal justice system imprisons only one criminal per 100 violent crimes. Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before being released. In 1993, there were 43.6 million criminal victimizations in America, more than 10 million of them violent. Between 1985 and 1993, the rate at which boys 14 through 17 committed murder increased by about 50% for whites and 300% for blacks. A third of all violent crimes, including murders, are committed by felons out on probation, parole or pretrial release. What is involved here is more than a failure of public safety; it is a massive failure of governmental obligation. Citizens should not have to accept their government's prolonged, persistent failure to restrain violent and repeat criminals. A government incapable of restraining known, violent, repeat criminals within its custody cannot be trusted to take on more complicated and costly public functions.
<p>
There is also the matter of eroding public trust in our political institutions. A government that, amid much fanfare, passes wave after wave of get-tough anti-crime laws but proves toothless in the execution of those laws eviscerates pubic confidence in the integrity of lawmakers and the criminal justice system. Indeed, in 1993 and again in 1994, there was only one public institution in which the American people had less confidence than in Congress: the criminal justice system. No representative democracy can long survive this deep and disheartening lack of public trust. And the only way to restore public trust is to shut the revolving door.
<p>
A final point: A society tells as much about itself by what it punishes as what it praises, by what it condemns as well as what it encourages, by what receives reprobation as what receives approbation. The message of our justice system is all too clear to criminals and victims: Too often, for too many, it says "nobody cares" and "nothing matters." That has to change soon or the carnage and violence that have become almost permanent features of America's landscape will worsen.

<title>Letter to Strom Thurmond re: ABM Treaty and SDI</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
August 1, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
The Honorable Strom Thurmond<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, DC  20510<br>
<p>
Dear Chairman Thurmond:
<p>
We are really pleased that you are addressing the most important issue in defense policy for our times:  the capacity of America to defend itself.  As you and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have determined, our nation needs a ballistic missile defense program.  For most of our history, what George Washington described as "our blessed location" made us invulnerable to attack by hostile nations.  But because technology overcame the security of location, we are no longer invulnerable.  Today, we lack the capacity to defend ourselves against ballistic missiles.  But most Americans do not yet understand our vulnerability to attacks by ballistic missiles.  Most Americans do not yet understand that for the first time in our history, when we speak of defense, we must now include our capacity to defend our country.
<p>
It dismays us, then, that instead of focusing on our current needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.  They argue that moving to develop needed defenses and modifying the ABM Treaty will jeopardize the possibility of Russian ratification of the START II Treaty.  American security should not be sacrificed in a vain effort to preserve the ABM Treaty.  The ABM Treaty, designed for a bipolar world, always had dubious value.  It is now wholly outdated.  It's only relevance to the contemporary world is not how it influences the START II Treaty, whose ratification by Russia, in any case, is uncertain irrespective of any action on the ABM Treaty.  The only relevance of the ABM Treaty to the contemporary world is to hamper an effective effort to defend America.
<p>
The development of missile defenses today is technologically and economically feasible.  We can speak and act with confidence in the world only when we can defend ourselves.  Our allies, adversaries and friends -- including the Russians -- all understand this.  It is time for the United States to defend the American people.
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
<br>
Jack Kemp<br>
Jeane Kirkpatrick

BADEN</P><P>PEOPLE who believe in the power of government to do good probably found it outrageous that the U.S. Senate squandered weeks debating higher grazing fees, a financially trivial issue. The Western Senators' filibuster diverted the Senate from critically important issues like NAFTA and health care. But this posturing is a predictable consequence of political management of the Western range.</P><P>       Current policies encourage overgrazing, discourage range improvements, inhibit innovation and sharply restrict allowable uses on the 315 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service. But below-cost grazing fees are not the primary source of ecological problems. The sources are rigid bureaucracies and insecure property rights.</P><P>     When looking at grazing fee &quot;subsidies,&quot; most commentators ignore an important fact: Aside from unanticipated inflation, the value of the &quot;subsidy&quot; has largely been incorporated into the sales price of private ranches with grazing privileges on public range. The BLM and Forest Service permits are attached to a &quot;base unit&quot; property (i.e., a private ranch). The ranch's sales price captures the value of cheap public grazing that comes with it.</P><P>     It is as if a car came with a sticker entitling the owner to 20 cent a gallon gas. The car with the sticker would sell for more than one without because it includes a valuable subsidy. Similarly, subsidies increase the value of a ranch possessing federal grazing permits.</P><P>     Ranchers who received the original fee subsidy in 1934 died with a one-time windfall gain. But many present owners have already paid for the subsidy through higher prices when they bought ranches with public grazing permits. Most present owners can afford higher fees, but ethically, this is irrelevant.  While we should adjust fees for inflation, it seems unfair to impose a penalty on present owners just because the original owners received an unjust, unearned financial gain.</P><P>     Dr. Karl Hess Jr., a range ecologist, expert on Western lands and author of &quot;Visions Upon the Land,&quot; notes that higher fees are unlikely to improve ecological conditions and reduce overgrazing on the public range. If we want improvement, we need to change existing institutional arrangements, not simply fiddle with prices.</P><P>     Ecological and social problems are caused by regulations that encourage poor management practices - grazing too many cows and sheep, underinvesting in range improvements and maintenance and failing to replace domestic stock with more valuable wildlife. As noted above, poor management persists for two reasons: bureaucracy and imperfectly transferable property rights. Better management will follow secure, well-defined, and transferable property rights for those who use the public range, be they a private ranch or the Nature Conservancy Trust.</P><P>    I suggest a modest reform. Give those with privileges to graze on public land the opportunity to buy a grazing right at a price incorporating the future value of the &quot;subsidized&quot; fee. Economists call this price the capitalized value of the fee. Logically, it would be similar to converting an apartment to a condominium. Future rents of the apartment are capitalized into the sale price of the condominium.</P><P>     With this reform, ranchers would have legal property rights to the public forage. They could exchange those rights among themselves or sell them to those with other interests, e.g., ecological diversity, wildlife habitat for hunters, or stream-side preservation. These interests are growing and new ones will surely develop.</P><P>     Incorporating the subsidy into the permit's price avoids penalizing owners who &quot;purchased&quot; a subsidy when they bought their private land and should reduce their opposition to reform. Everyone is better off because current owners retain access to the public range and taxpayers no longer subsidize management. There are also new incentives for innovation.</P><P>     At present, the permit is only for grazing domestic livestock, even if the land has greater value for wildlife or recreation. BLM policy dictates that grazing privileges must be used. If not used, they are sold to others. Thus, when organizations acquire public range privileges and try to retire them from grazing, the privileges are stripped away. Last April, this happened to the Nature Conservancy in Mercer vs. BLM. If grazing rights were freely transferable, diverse uses would flourish, reflecting emerging environmental values.</P><P>     A legal property right to forage on public lands would also discourage overgrazing and encourage range improvements. Ranchers could rest overused lands without fear of regulatory reprisal. Moreover, if ranchers knew they would benefit from range improvements, they are more likely to replant native grasses and forbs that have been destroyed by a century of overgrazing. Cooperating with others, some would also manage for wildlife.</P><P>     Environmentalists and those seeking efficient government can join to promote institutional reforms that recognize new ecological understandings and changing tastes. When we allocate via politics, special interests and financial waste will prevail. Property rights and voluntary arrangements are far more responsive - and often more responsible. </P><P>------------------------------------------------------------------- </P><P>John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P><H1>Free-trade pact links prosperity and environment</H1></P><P> September 28, 1992</P><P>JOHN BADEN</P><P>           INTERNATIONAL trade, a vital component of the Northwest economy, has come under fire from a seemingly unlikely source: environmentalists.</P><P> At issue is the recently concluded North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA would create the world's largest free-trade zone, encompassing over 360 million people and $6.2 trillion worth of goods and services a year.</P><P>     The potential benefits are substantial. One recent economic analysis by the Institute for International Economics calculated that NAFTA's adoption would result in a net increase of about 175,000 jobs in the U.S. by 1995. The pact would also benefit Mexico</P><P> by further opening the wealthy U.S. market to their goods, creating jobs and prosperity. And Mexico would benefit as a trade agreement creates new opportunities for direct foreign investment and energizes its rapidly modernizing economy.</P><P>     However, all is not rosy for the future of NAFTA. While both President Bush and Governor Clinton claim to support free trade, both are subject to election-year pressures. This has produced protectionist benefits for brewers, state-owned industries, auto producers, and bankers, among others. Environmentalists and traditional protectionists, &quot;Baptists and Bootleggers&quot; as their unholy alliance is called, have formed a powerful voice against NAFTA and gained a hearing with both Congress and trade negotiators.</P><P>     Earlier this month the House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 in favor of a nonbinding resolution that calls for the trade accord to not jeopardize American health, safety, and environmental standards. Worries abound that Mexico will become a &quot;pollution haven,&quot; spawning a multitude of dirty industries and encouraging U.S. companies to migrate to Mexico to avoid tough domestic environmental laws. However, the best available information suggests that NAFTA will foster both environmental safeguards and progress.</P><P>     The Bush administration states that any trade agreement must &quot;maintain the right to prohibit the entry of goods that do not meet U.S. health, safety, pesticide, food and drug and environmental regulations.&quot; The qualifications are (1) such regulations must apply equally to domestic and foreign producers (and therefore not constitute an unfair barrier to trade), and (2) they must have a scientific basis. A trilateral commission composed of trade experts, scientists, and environmentalists is being formed to hear challenges to the environmental rules of trading partners.</P><P>     Much concern about the creation of &quot;pollution havens&quot; centers on Mexico and its lax enforcement of environmental laws. However, the World Bank finds little evidence that companies are willing to move manufacturing plants simply to avoid environmental regulations, as environmental costs form a small percentage of total costs. And it is likely that the increased foreign investment brought by free trade will bring with it advanced pollution control technologies. U.S. multinationals often hold foreign plants and subsidiaries to U.S. environmental standards.</P><P>     Historically, Mexico's environment has been far dirtier than accepted U.S. standards. But that is changing because environmental knowledge, sensitivity, and managerial ability all increase with rising per capita income. These good things go together.</P><P>     For Mexican President Salinas, environmental protection holds a high priority. He has privatized many inefficient and polluting state-owned industries, requiring them to meet tougher environmental standards to which they were not subject as state-owned companies. He has increased his environmental agency's budget from $4.3 million to $88.4 million in five years. Mexico has started to work with the U.S. EPA to clean up the highly polluted maquiladoras assembly plants and the rapidly growing &quot;sister cities&quot; of the border region. The two countries are planning to spend about $1 billion here over the next three years.</P><P>     These steps will go a significant way toward protecting human health and the environment in Mexico. And it is important to note that the best way for the U.S. to ensure that Mexico continues this environmental progress is to support NAFTA.</P><P>     This is because a free-trade agreement brings increased national prosperity - and it is prosperity that fuels demand for higher standards of environmental quality. Rich nations have cleaner environments than do poor nations. Recent research by Professor Donald Coursey of Washington University in St. Louis shows that across time and across countries per capita spending on the environment rises directly with income. Protected land acreage also rises with income, implying that more forest preserves and parks will be created as Mexico grows richer.</P><P>     Delegates at June's Earth Summit in Rio noted that poverty is the chief threat to both the environment and human health. EPA Administrator William Reilly writes about NAFTA that &quot;As the Mexican economy grows, so will its devotion to environmental protection and its ability to pay the costs of environmental stewardship.&quot; The lesson is that environmental quality and economic prosperity are strongly and positively linked. As a free country grows and rises out of subsistence living it becomes more, not less, environmentally friendly.</P><P>     By increasing incomes and promoting economic growth in Mexico through a North American Free-Trade Agreement, the U.S. can increase Mexico's environmental awareness and ability to effectively steward its environmental resources. That is a relationship that should appeal to both environmentalists and free-traders alike.</P><P>______________</P><P> John Baden is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the Environmental Management Program in the School of Business at the University of Washington.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P><H1>Drug-price controls would hurt, not help, consumers</H1></P><P>April 27, 1993</P><P>JOHN A. BADEN</P><P>           THE president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are selling the outlines of their health-care program to the nation. We have been told to expect many good things from it. Universal access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and expanded basic care would benefit many people. But it is likely that fully implementing a nationalized health-care plan will cost between $50 and $100 billion per year.</P><P>       Expanding access and coverage conflicts with the desire to trim the nation's health-care bill. But the president feels pressure to &quot;do something&quot; about costs of health care. The pharmaceutical industry is an obvious and tempting target.</P><P>     The drug industry is vulnerable to attack for several reasons. It has been consistently profitable, with returns as much as double those of the rest of manufacturing. Most prescription drug cost are paid directly by patients, making price increases immediately apparent. And the patent protection provided to new drugs creates an effective temporary monopoly, at least to the extent that a drug's properties are not duplicated by other drugs on the market.</P><P>     All of this makes drug companies an easy target for government intervention: Some people claim we need price controls to protect the consumer. And what consumer would not like drugs to be cheaper? (Even though prescription drugs account for only a nickel of every health-care dollar, and thus have only a small impact on overall health-care costs.) But more importantly, there are several good arguments as to why price controls would hurt, not help, consumers.</P><P>     Consumers care about more than just low prices. In the drug market especially, they are served by innovative new products with greater healing properties. That is the trade-off: prices versus innovation. We could have a constrained drug market with low prices and protracted negotiations between companies and the federal government over prices that may be charged for new drugs. But most people would prefer an innovative market with many new, and presumably more helpful, drugs.</P><P>     It is the profits on new, successful drugs that prompt the intensive research and development to find the next generation of miracle cures and therapies. New drugs are expensive to develop, costing an average of $231 million each in 1987. Of these, only three in 10 break even.</P><P>     So a successful drug must pay for its own research, as well as the research on the unsuccessful ones on which the company also risked money. In addition to the high emotions of illness, it is this risk and expense that make the drug industry so special. And the high risk explains why the government awards 14-year patents on new drugs. This gives the makers time to recoup their tremendous development expenditures before their research is copied and generic alternatives are offered.</P><P>     Price controls would take away the monopoly advantages of patent protection and undermine the incentives for research that patents were designed to provide. As an academic report on Medicaid and Medicare drug price controls not-so-succinctly put it, the revenue decline to drug companies resulting from price controls &quot;can be expected to negatively influence the expected returns on new drugs and to decrease the cash flow available to undertake R&amp;D.&quot;</P><P>        Price control enthusiasts will argue that it will be possible to hold down prices, but not so low that it undermines research. But this faith in the ability of regulators to control the market is not supported by our experience with regulation and price controls elsewhere. Medicaid and Medicare efforts to control the price of drugs and services caused cost-shifting to unregulated health-care payers. But industrywide price controls will prevent such shifting, leading to shortages and black markets.</P><P>     There were similar results during the Nixon-era price controls of 1971-74, as regulations and regulators multiplied while trying in vain to keep pace with the market's ability to circumvent price controls.</P><P>       As with the rest of the health-care program, we have only been told about the benefits of price controls on drugs. What is hidden are the harder-to-quantify but still real constraints upon innovation and new drug development.</P><P>       If we do not understand the logic driving the system we are likely to take well-intended actions that have perverse consequences. Unless we are sensitive to the importance of incentives to innovation, we can be sure that some important drugs will not be developed or introduced because of drug-price controls.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P>           IS RANCHING on the federal range an environmentally destructive anachronism? Many environmentalists seem to think so. Less than 30,000 ranchers graze cattle on 350 million acres of federal lands, an area twice the size of Texas. Environmentalists hope the public lands will be, as the bumper sticker intones, &quot;Cattle Free by '93.&quot;</P><P>         Grazing has also been the target of budget reformers; grazing programs subsidize what environmental writer Edward Abbey called &quot;welfare cowboys.&quot; These programs cost taxpayers about $50 million a year. Some permit holders, however, have found public lands to be quite profitable.</P><P>     A recent report by the Department of the Interior highlights one case in which a California public utility subleased its public grazing privileges to ranchers. It charged subleases 315 percent more per animal unit month than it paid to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the grazing permits. The bottom line: The public loses money to permit holders' benefit.</P><P>     Ranchers are politically powerful and have successfully headed off attempts at fee reform. Last September, for example, a modest fee increase approved by the House was subsequently negotiated away by the Senate. Today grazing rates remain at about one-quarter of the average of private lands in the same region.</P><P>     The answer seems to be raising grazing fees to the market level. Ethically and economically, it is not that simple.</P><P>     BLM grazing privileges were assigned to ranchers under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Preference was given to nearby landowners. Over time, grazing privileges have become linked to these &quot;base properties,&quot; with leases being routinely renewed. Today the permits are virtually owned by the base property holders, though technically given as &quot;privileges&quot; by the BLM.</P><P>     This &quot;ownership&quot; has been ratified in a number of ways. The value of the grazing permits is taxed by the Internal Revenue Service when a ranch is inherited. Permits are also accepted by FDIC-insured banks as collateral for loans. And they are routinely transferred to new owners by the BLM when a base property is sold. Over time, the value of these &quot;rights&quot; has been incorporated into the value of associated private ranch lands.</P><P>     Consider this analogy: Two cars are auctioned. They are identical in every way except that one carries a sticker entitling it to half-price gasoline for the life of the automobile. Surely the cheaper gasoline does not come free; the discount on gas will produce higher bids for the car. Gas or grass, it works the same. A ranch sold with federal grazing permits is worth more than one without permits. An economist would say that the value of access to cheap grass becomes capitalized into the ranch's value.</P><P>     So those who have received a subsidy are those who got the initial windfall and sold out for a higher price. Many ranchers who own the base properties today have paid for their subsidy, which makes it no subsidy at all. As the director of the BLM wrote, &quot;The point is that we simply do not know who is `unduly' benefiting or if they are benefiting at all.&quot;</P><P>       Simply raising grazing fees is unfair to the ranchers who have paid for cheap government-land grazing through the value capitalized into their ranch's purchase price. So how else can we reform the federal grazing lands?</P><P>       A free market in permits can help end government subsidies in a just way. Grazing permits could be offered to the current ranchers for the value of future grazing fees. The permits could then be freely exchanged.</P><P>     The federal government would stop subsidizing management of the land but would still own it and set environmental standards; for example, by requiring protection of riparian areas as a condition of holding permits.</P><P>     Environmentalists have long pointed out that there are many valuable uses for federal lands, among them recreation and wildlife habitat. The current system's &quot;use it or lose it&quot; requirements effectively prevent shifts from cattle to other uses. A permit holder cannot save winter range for elk and other wildlife because even if the grazing fees are paid, the permits may be revoked and &quot;unused&quot; forage reallocated to another ranch.</P><P>     A transferable permit system would encourage diverse uses. Grazing would continue, but land would surely be dedicated to esthetics and biodiversity by groups like the North American Elk Foundation or the Nature Conservancy.</P><P>     There are several benefits of owned and transferable permits. For example, with more secure access, permit holders would have incentives to invest in and improve the public lands. Property rights encourage diversity and provide incentives for stewardship. This change will benefit our range land and the people who care about its diverse values.</P><P> _______________</P><P> John A.

<title>Renewing American Civilization Class Eight -- PFF</title>
Renewing American Civilization Class Eight<br>
Creating American Jobs in the Work Market<br>
Reinhardt College February 25, 1995<br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
Television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the eighth of
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course which presents the foundational
principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization.  This week's
lesson, the world market, focuses on the world market and an information
age third-wave American strategy for being the highest value-added
competitor with the most productive jobs, the most market-oriented
producers, leading to the highest take-home pay and the highest quality of
life.
<P>
Let me welcome everyone this morning, and I want to welcome the students of
Mind Extension University and remind everyone who might be watching us by
television or on videotape or audio tape that you can mail your comments
to: Renewing American Civilization, post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia
30065.  You can fax your comments to 404-528-9806.  You can e-mail your
comments to America Online at renewam@aol. com.  Or you can get class
transcripts and other class materials available on our Internet web page,
which is http://www. pff.org.
<P>
Finally, for people who are into a more traditional kind of way of
communicating, although I'd point out 800 numbers were not very traditional
30 years ago, you can order "American Civilization" newspaper, video and
audio tapes, and course readings by calling 1- 800-to-renew.
<P>
And this course is based on the premise that there are five pillars of
American Civilization.  First, the historic lessons of American
Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third, entrepreneurial free
enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and discovery.  And, fifth,
quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And in the course of this course, we
take two hours with each of those pillars, and then we apply them to four
areas.  Last week we talked about the Third Wave and American Civilization,
the Alvin and Heidi Toffler model of a Third Wave of change.  Then we
talked today about creating American jobs in the world market.  Then next
week, we will talk about replacing the culture of violence and poverty with
a culture of productivity and safety.  And finally, we'll talk about --
we'll end the course with citizenship and community in 21st century
America.  What does all this change mean and how do we Renew American
Civilization, and what's our role in that?
<P>
Now, today's class is creating American jobs in the world market.  And I
think it's very important to see this as a dual edge, creating American
jobs, but doing so in the world market.  And before we get to that, several
of you, in the spirit of a certain amount of current events, it is true
that in weekly "World News" cover, "Space Alien Meets with Newt Gingrich."
This was not about negotiating for a bigger market than the world market.
And national security prevents me from describing exactly what happened.
But since one of you brought this today, I couldn't resist starting by --
this is the closest to current events we've gotten in this course so far.
Just further proof that this is a diverse and creative society, with people
who think up a lot of strange things.
<P>
By the way, I also have to say in terms of the concept of the Third Wave
and what an extraordinary, diverse civilization we are, you'll remember
last week, I talked about the notion that the Chinese word for "crisis" is
actually made of the ideograph -- two ideographs for "danger" and
"opportunity," and that when we figured this out, we were going to use it
-- about 10:00 o'clock Friday night preparing the class -- that we did not
have the ideograph, and then a gentleman faxed this to us from San
Francisco.
<P>
Now, after the class, I learned that the story gets even better.  The top
character is "danger." The bottom character is "opportunity." And that this
was sent to us by Fred Chow, who is an 82-year-old first-generation
American who emigrated from China, and he lives in San Francisco.  And a
friend of ours who knows Fred Chow heard me say -- on camera, heard me say,
"gee, we don't have this ideograph," literally picked up the phone, called,
and said, "Fred, can you fax it to Reinhardt? " And within that length of
time, it got here.  So pretty good deal.  And again, an example both of how
extraordinarily diverse America is and of how the information age works and
how rapidly you can get things done.
<P>
Now, there's a central premise to this particular session, and one that I
think we don't focus enough energy and attention on as the base of much of
our public policy, and that is that economic growth is vital to a free
society.  That it's economic growth that creates jobs, it's economic growth
that creates wealth.  That you can't redistribute wealth if you don't
create it, that you can't have charities if you don't first have income.
That you can't take care of your family if you don't have a job, and that
jobs come from economic growth.  And that the best way to ensure future
jobs is to have a growth-oriented pattern, not to have a protective
pattern.
<P>
I'm going to get into this and spend some time.  But it's very important,
because the first attitude of people is to say, "boy, I want to protect my
current job." And that leads you, as you'll see in a minute, into a
past-oriented, defensive attitude.
<P>
So let's start with the premise, what this two hours is about is, how do we
get economic growth in the 21st century?  What does economic growth in jobs
and take-home pay mean for Americans?
<P>
Now, I want to now go to a second point, which is very controversial, but I
want to assert as a fact, and I would be very glad to defend either here or
anywhere else, and that is that the world market is an inescapable reality.
And that it will define the requirements for economic growth.  Now, this
is a very central debate that we have to have as a country.  My point is
that you cannot avoid the world market.  I use the term "inescapable
reality." It's not about, do you like it or dislike -- this is not about
GATT and NAFTA.  This is about the objective fact that all over the planet,
there are smart people getting up every morning and competing, and that
that's just an objective reality, and that they are going to have an impact
on your interest rate, they're going to have an impact on your money
supply.  They're going to have an impact on your products.  And that unless
you start a design with "let's look at the world market," you are not being
realistic economically about who we're competing with.
<P>
You can come in and say to me, boy, here we are in North Georgia.  We have
got a plan that will knock the socks off Tennessee.  And if, in fact, it is
a plan which will be drowned by Germany and China, it is irrelevant.  And
so as we design American economic growth, we have to start from a 21st
century notion of the world partly driven by technology.  You now live on a
planet where you can pick up the phone, dial direct and reach virtually
every country on the planet in real-time.
<P>
Now, this is an enormous change from 100 years ago.  It's a big change from
30 years ago, when it was still fairly hard to make a transatlantic call
and now it's universal.  You can fax worldwide.  And we did.  During the
problems in Russia several years ago, people were faxing back and forth and
e-mailing back and forth.  A level of openness that was unthinkable.  And
it was probably unavoidable in the modern world.  Somebody told me this
morning that they're now talking about taking out dish receivers in Iran,
because having your own dish receiver, you know, is a way of getting
information.
<P>
Of course, this is happening at the very moment, as Kathleen Minnix was
saying, when we're now inventing smaller and smaller dish receivers, which
means people will have a contraband dish receiver in their attic.  I mean,
it's that kind of constant effort.  You know, the world's getting smaller.
We are competing not just with other Americans, we're competing with Mexico
and China and Japan and Germany, and we have no choice.  You can choose
what the terms of the competition are, but you can't choose the
competition.  You can determine how your government interfaces with the
competition, but you will compete somehow.  In that framework, I want to
suggest that a global economy is important because there is more
opportunity in the world than there is in one country.  And because
competition within a global economy forces us to be more creative and
innovative.
<P>
Now, there are two points here.  First of all, as a consumer, if your
choice is to buy bananas grown in a hothouse in North Georgia or to buy
bananas grown in Africa or Latin America, it is an economically nutty
decision to buy a hothouse banana, because it's just dramatically more
expensive.  And so the wider the world market, the greater the choices you
have.  In addition, if you take every good idea on the planet this year and
you weave them together into American productivity, you're going to have
more good ideas than if you only take the American ideas.  So that being
open to the world allows you to have both more consumer choice and it
allows you to have more understanding of ways of being productive that are
good for competition.
<P>
In a sense, Arnold Schwarzenegger by coming to the U. S. created a major
export industry.  I think it was "Terminator II" that made $200 million
overseas, which is literally the same as selling textiles or shoes or
something else.  He had created a product which earned at foreign exchange
for the U. S. , And yet he originally, of course, was born in Austria.  But
whether you're importing a human being or you're importing an idea, I mean,
many ideas now come to the U.S.  We and the Japanese are the two highest
value-added producers of new ideas on the planet.  So if somebody in France
will invent something, we'll market it.  We and the Japanese are basically
in competition to see who can market better.
<P>
The other part of it is that when you have to compete inside a global
economy, it's the same as belonging to a regional football league or
belonging to a national football league.  When you've got to compete in the
highest level of competition on the planet, your factories get better, your
managers get better, your inventors get better, and you just have a
different level in pace and pressure of creativity.  So by being in the
world market, you keep your country at the front edge.  And to the degree
that you withdraw from the world market, you allow your own companies to be
less competitive.  This is a big problem in Europe now where the more the
Europeans protect their industries, the more obsolescent their industries
get.
<P>
Whereas, Ford, for example, which is a world company, had to go through an
excruciating cultural change to compete with Toyota.  Volvo, Mercedes,
Renault, Fiat, they didn't go through that big a change.  The result is
Ford is now a generation ahead of any European car company at being
competitive.  General Motors is in the process of going through the same
change.  Chrysler is going through the same change.  And the result is the
two most efficient producers of cars in the world are Ford and Toyota, and
they're almost indistinguishable now in terms of how competitive they are.
And they play head to head.  The really great -- and there are great
European car companies, but they're dramatically more inefficient.  They
have a much longer turnaround time on new models, and they have much less
effective use of resources.  And over time, that eats you up.  It means
you're not competitive.
<P>
Now, in that setting, let me suggest to you that our goal here -- and I
really have to thank my wife Marianne, who came up with this -- is that
local jobs through world sales defines the new reality.  One of our
problems is to get across to people, this is not about overseas jobs.  When
we talk about the world market, it's not about fancy people overseas.  It's
about scientific Atlanta, which now has a five-year backlog of orders.  So
in North Atlanta, scientific Atlanta is employing several thousand people
selling all across the planet.
<P>
And it's that kind of continuing process of Coca-Cola, which makes money
everywhere on the planet, practically.  And so there are jobs in Atlanta
which come directly out of Coca-Cola.  It's interesting, "Georgia Trend"
magazine had a 250-page section entitled, "global connections." This is the
December 1994 issue.  And they have 20 pages of listings of companies in
Georgia that have specific relations to the world market.  So this is
literally about, how do we create local jobs through the world market?
Because that's the reality we're now dealing with.  To understand how we do
that, we have to start with certain societal aspects of competitiveness.
That is, compared to other countries what's our taxation, regulation,
litigation, education, cultural values, and government structure like?
<P>
Let me carry you through.  Does our tax code encourage saving and
investing, or does it encourage consumption?  If it encourages consumption,
compared to the German and Japanese tax codes, guess who will have more
money available for the next generation of factories?  So when you talk to
the biotechnology companies, where of the top 15 products of the world, all
15 are American, their major problem in creating new jobs -there are over
100,000 high evaluated jobs now in biotechnology -their major problem in
creating new jobs is they can't get enough capital to build new factories.
It takes hundreds of millions of dollars because of our next item, which is
regulation, to bring a biotechnology product on the American market.  So if
you can't find the money even if you have the idea, you can't market the
product.
<P>
And so Japanese and German companies are looking at buying our
biotechnology where we have a dominant position, because they have the
capital.  We don't.  Second is regulation.  It takes -- it now takes almost
as long for the regulations for building a computer chip factory to be
processed as the lifetime of the computer chip.  So even if you solve
taxation and you have the money and you're told, "well, now, you can come
to Thailand and break ground Tuesday morning or you can file for an EPA
permit and in three years we'll solve it," you may conclude because of the
speed of change in computers, that you have to go offshore just because you
can't afford to deal with American red tape.  The third problem is
litigation.  You're told, "you could do this in Germany, and there they
have a 'loser pays' system, and there are very few lawsuits about this, or
you could do it in the U. S.  And there are 23 trial lawyers who'd like to
meet you Tuesday."
<P>
Which system - - and by the way, Edwards Deming said that litigation was
one of the two major things, health care being the other, that made America
non-competitive.  And he singled out litigation and the degree to which
this is a litigious society, where you graduate more lawyers than engineers
and then you compete with Japan, which graduates more engineers than
lawyers.  There are more lawyers in Georgia than there are in the country
of Japan.  Just to give you some sense of scale.  Fourth is education.  I
mean, to do quality right, you have to know math.  The average American
high school graduate does not know enough math.  In fact, the average
American college graduate does not know enough math to do the math expected
of a typical high school graduate in Japan.
<P>
So if you're going to do quantitative analysis, if you're going to set up a
systems approach, if you're going to say, "what is" -- you know, "what is a
common occurrence and what's a unique occurrence? " Remember when we did
Deming?  In order to build the statistical model, you have to have a better
ability to do math than most Americans have.  And so corporations find the
education level is not only not acceptable, it's decaying, particularly in
the inner cities.  So that you're less likely to be able to hire somebody
to compete in the world market if your education system collapses.
<P>
Fifth is cultural values.  If you're competing with somebody who still
believes in the work ethic and you're competing with somebody who gets up
every morning thinking about, "how can I win this competition," and your
culture now has said, "well, don't be a workaholic and don't push it, and
after all, you know, you really don't -- you don't want to be a rate
breaker." Again, we find, for example, honor students who get beaten up now
because in some inner city schools, they're seen as being deviant because
they want to study too much.  Well, how's that going to compete in the
world market?  So cultural attitudes matter.
<P>
And finally, government structure.  I mean, do you have a government --
when you learn that, for example, as was recently reported, there are 27
factories in China that are pirating American products, openly pirating
them, and when the Chinese government says to them, "we won't stop them,"
you have an obligation to have a government which is aggressive enough and
competent enough to hit them hard enough economically that they can't
afford it.  And if you are too slow, too soft, too confused, you can't be
competitive.  And so you've got to have a government structure which --
because in the world market, governments are like blocking backs in
football.  I mean, if you don't have a government which is strong enough to
protect your interests, the companies can't survive, because they're up
against nation states.
<P>
And so if the other side says, "my government will help me cheat, your
government won't help you at all," guess who wins in the long run?  That's
a very key part.  If you're going to have a free market on a worldwide
basis, the government had better be competent enough to be a good referee,
because the other side's going to have a government that intervenes on
their behalf.
<P>
Now, when you look at those larger issues, what I want to do now is come
back and I want you to be looking for how the five pillars of American
Civilization relate to success in the world market.  What are the
historical lessons of American Civilization?  And we're going to use some
examples.  What does personal strength mean if you're going to be
competitive?  How does entrepreneurial free enterprise factor in?  What
does the spirit of invention and discovery mean?  And what is quality as
defined by Deming?  And how do all five of these begin to relate to
competing in the world market?
<P>
And what I want to start with is the notion that there are actually two
models, and before we put them up -- well, they got excited.  They put them
up.  One is the welfare state, which is -good.  They stopped.  What I want
you to see, we talk a lot about vision, which then leads to strategies,
which then leads to projects, which are definable, delegatable
achievements, and then, what do you do every day?  What are your tactics,
okay?
<P>
And this is a very important example to show you, which we'll do again next
week, that we're talking here about two very, very different models.  And
that they are literally models.  That based on what you believe at a vision
level, that you end up with two very different ways of approaching things.
But if all you do is come down here -- and this is one of our problems,
frankly, with the modern news media and with modern politics.  If all you
do is you focus on these tactical issues down here, you can't appreciate by
studying at this level how enormous the difference in the two systems is.
And, in fact, they may look like they're sort of similar.  But if they're
similar in appearance but relate back to a totally different system of
thought, you're making radically different decisions.
<P>
And so one of the reasons I take the time to try to teach the course and
try to lay out the ideas is until we as a people can get used to talking
about vision and strategies, we just drown in tactics.  And we don't
understand what the core problems are.  And this goes back, remember, to
Drucker's warning in "the Effective Executive" that good executives always
ask of a problem, what is it a symptom of?  And this relates back to this
whole model.  When you find out that the Chinese are getting away with
pirating goods, what is that a symptom?  What failure led that to happen?
And you find out that the failure is, we don't have an aggressive enough
customs agency.  What is that a symptom of?  What does it tell you about
the layer above that?  So you're constantly trying to go back in and look
for the -- it's sort of like imagine you're coughing this morning, and we
keep focusing on the cough.  But is your cough because you have
tuberculosis?  Is your cough because you have the flu?  Is your cough
because you have hay fever?  Is your cough because you just have a sore
throat?  You know, what's going on and why are you coughing?  Well, you've
got to work your way back up.  You've got to understand what's behind the
tactical event.
<P>
Now, what I'm going to describe in the next few minutes are two very
different models of thinking about America in the world market, and I want
to -- I'm going to suggest to you that one of them is a welfare state
model, and the other is an opportunity society model.  That the welfare
state basically hides from the world markets, and the opportunity society
believes you have to win in the world markets.
<P>
Now, there are two important concepts here.  One is, gee, if only we could
build big enough barriers, we could hide, and then people wouldn't come and
compete with us.  The other, though, is -- notice the key word I used here,
which is a sometimes controversial word, "win" in the world market.  That
is, you want -- you don't want to design a strategy just to compete.  You
want to design a strategy to win.  And I would argue at the vision level,
that you want to design a strategy which creates the highest value-added
jobs in the world, so that Americans have the highest take-home pay, so we
have the highest standard of living.
<P>
Now, if you start thinking about -- and think about the difference you get
psychologically if I say to you, "let's compete" or I say to you, "let's
win." Because winning justifies the extra weekend of work.  Winning
justifies the extra focus on quality.  Winning justifies the extra effort
to be creative.  But notice how different the two are.  So I don't just
want to be in the world market.  I think America's goal ought to be to win
in the world market.  In that framework, there are a couple of key
differences.  The welfare state is essentially static.  The opportunity
society is dynamic.
<P>
Now, let me give you an example of that that I'm going to come back to
later, but that I just can't resist.  The president of M. I. T.  Visited me
this week and was telling me about the marvelous things they're doing
there, one of which, by the way, is developing surgical training by virtual
reality, where you literally -- huh?
<P>
>>I read about that somewhere.
<P>
>>Okay.  So you literally will have surgeons who will practice, in effect,<br>
>>inside the computer based on virtual reality.  Those of you who have been<br>
>>to Dave & buster's have a slight taste of what this is going to be like.<br>
>>This is -- I don't know if the camera can come in and pick it up.  This<br>
>>right here, can you see the gray thing?  It shows up on the screen pretty<br>
>>good.  Okay?  Got the gray thing?  That has 70 electric motors on it.<br>
>>You will have, early in the next century, in essence, a personal<br>
>>Roto-Rooter, and if your arteries clog, we'll be able to just sort of cut<br>
>>a slice in your leg and put in the Roto-Rooter, it will run up connected<br>
>>by fiber optic, clean out the clogged areas, come back out, and that will<br>
>>be open-heart surgery.  Probably be an outpatient procedure.  Now, what's<br>
>>it worth to do that instead of going in the hospital for four days or for<br>
>>three days?  How good a -- or die.  I mean, how good a product does this<br>
>>start getting to be, right?  And I'll let you think about everything<br>
>>which could be miniaturized and which would be useful at a miniaturized<br>
>>level, but I'm using this as a tiny example.<br>
<P>
The world I think of living in is a world that is dynamic.  It is
constantly evolving, constantly changing.  Whatever happens today doesn't
tell you what will happen tomorrow, so we're constantly looking for the
flow of things.  But in the welfare state, the world's static.  So the
welfare state sees change as danger, where we see change as opportunity.
And we see change as inevitable, where the welfare state thinks it can hide
from it.  Now, this is compounded by the next layer, because the welfare
state is essentially bureaucratic, and the opportunity society is
potentially entrepreneurial.  One is driven by regulations and rules, the
other is driven by a desire for results.  Very different models of
behavior.  In the welfare state, numbers count.  In the opportunity
society, people count.
<P>
Now, what does this mean?  It means that where they're saying, "well, we
can invest $214 million," we're saying, "let's see if we can find bill
gates." Because Bill Gates will ultimately be worth billions.  Where
they're saying, "let's see if we can have this level of training in this
box organized this way," we're saying, "I wonder if Steve Jobs would like
to drop out of college and invent Apple Computer." It's a totally different
model.  It's a model that says we want to liberate every individual, and
that the total potential is 260 million creative individuals doing their
own thing and being excited.  Very different models of structure.
<P>
The welfare state tends to prop up the past; whereas, an opportunity
society focuses on creating the future.  I used to tell the story that if
Thomas Edison had invented the electric light in the age of the welfare
state, it would have been reported on TV news in a report which began, "the
candlemaking industry was threatened today." And the focus would be on what
had happened that was negative.  And the opening of the transcontinental
railroad would be described as "the stagecoach industry in decline."
<P>
It's an attitude.  It's a way of thinking about things.  Do you think
about, gee, the past is leaving me?  Or do you think about, wow, what an
exciting future?  And that doesn't mean it's not a difficult future or a
slightly scary future.  I'm not being Pollyanna.  But which way are you
oriented in terms of your policies and your behavior?  The welfare state
ultimately ironically is oriented towards big business and towards unions.
Whereas, the opportunity society is focused on small business.
<P>
There's a practical reason, by the way.  If you're a bureaucrat and you can
get three auto companies in the room, you can deal with three.  If you're
told there are 72,000 silicon valley software companies in America, you
can't as a bureaucrat deal with it.  The number's impossible.  And so
bigness makes government feel more secure, because it reduces the number of
variables.  Whereas, smallness leads to extraordinary creativity, but it's
literally unmanageable.  You can barely lead it.
<P>
>>You maintain a stability, though, in your system if you --
<P>
>>no.
<P>
>>-- Back to not --
<P>
>>you get the stability you get by surfing or by riding a kayak on a wild<br>
>>river.  I mean, you stay afloat dynamically -- that's exactly my point<br>
>>earlier.  You stay afloat dynamically.
<P>
>>but your feet are always wet.
<P>
>>That's exactly -- that's a good way to put it.  I mean, in an<br>
>>entrepreneurial society, there's always the sense of, this is going to be<br>
>>interesting.  Whereas, during the period of decay -- and you see this in<br>
>>Britain after world war ii -- you sort of feel good as you decay.  It's<br>
>>like being on a raft that's heading towards a waterfall and the raft is<br>
>>very stable, and you're going, well, this is sort of nice, and I don't<br>
>>have to work too hard and I don't have to change, and why are these<br>
>>people over here in the kayak going nuts, you know, and then you hit the<br>
>>waterfall and the whole thing goes off.<br>
<P>
Now, similarly think about the following: the welfare state sees technology
as a threat.  If you watch the way we operate in the opportunity society,
we consistently see technology as an opportunity.  It's a very powerful
cultural test.  The next time you read about new technology, do you think
it's an interesting way of improving the future or do you think it's a
threat to the present?  Now, it's, of course, both.  This goes right back
to the Chinese word, doesn't it?  I mean, every new technology is danger
and opportunity.  And the question is, which one do you make it?
<P>
So, of course, you know, if you are a glassmaker who blows glass and
Coca-Cola comes along and invents a system to make bottles automatically,
it's an enormous threat.  On the other hand, if you're the consumer of
bottled coke and they were going to charge you $37 per hand-blown bottle,
it's a terrific -- so you've got to constantly be looking in a dynamic way.
The welfare state ultimately, because of all this, clings to the Second
Wave, and the opportunity society inherently tries to grow the Third Wave
faster.
<P>
Now, one of the keys to this, which makes it very complicated to talk about
public policy, is that creating Third Wave jobs is the role of the
entrepreneur.  And we don't know how to teach this and we don't know how to
create public policy about it, but the fact is jobs are created by
entrepreneurial personalities who do not fill out reports very well, do not
show up in bureaucracies very well, don't make government employees very
comfortable, and can't explain themselves to reporters very articulately.
<P>
But almost always you can explain the past better than you can explain the
future, and almost always politics is organized around propping up the
past, not around creating the future, because by the time you get organized
enough to have an interest group, you're already the past.  And the people
who are inventing the future are too busy inventing to worry about being an
interest group.
<P>
In that framework, however, people need to learn if you wage class war on
employers, you are waging war on employees.  It's a very core concept.  I
mean, if you believe it's an entrepreneurial society and that to get into
the Third Wave and to dominate the world market you have to have lots of
entrepreneurs, but your attitude is if you're an entrepreneur you must be
bad, because after all, you're going to get rich, I mean, look at Bill
Gates.  It's terrible.  I mean, he's created 2200 millionaires in
Bremerton, and that's even worse, so it's not just him.  It's a whole class
of people who are doing bad things.  So if you want to punish the
entrepreneur, you by definition punish the job that would have been held by
the non-entrepreneur.
<P>
You can't have it both ways.  You can't say, well, let's just target --
we'll do a rifle shot.  Let's just shoot the one who is creative.  We won't
shoot the people who have jobs.  Guess what happens to all the jobs?  They
all disappear.  This is one of the most important psychological decisions
the country has to make.  Do you want jobs enough to create entrepreneurial
behaviors, in which case entrepreneurs will behave like entrepreneurs?  Or
do you dislike people who are successful enough that you'd rather punish
them even if the result is other people don't have jobs?  Because you can't
in a free society break out of that box.  It's one of the great formulas,
one of the great interesting conundrums of our time.
<P>
So you also want to remember that entrepreneurs create baby businesses.
It's not small businesses.  A baby business is a small business with a big
potential.  A lot of small businesses that start out small stay small and
want to be small.  People earning -- remember the McDonald brothers?  They
didn't want to become McDonald's, because it would have been too busy --
they'd have been too busy being managers.  They wanted three restaurants.
And so they said to Ray Kroc, you want to create McDonald's?  You create
it.  In fact, they didn't even want to do that until he talked them -- had
to literally talk them into it.  "please let me make you rich." You -- it
took him over a year, if you read his book "Grinding It Out."
<P>
So you're looking constantly for the baby business which is going to
explode.  Microsoft was always a baby business.  Federal Express started as
a baby business.  I mean, Fred Smith knew from the word "go" thiswas going
to be a world company.  Because it didn't make any sense as a Memphis
company.  In that framework, there are tremendous virtues of starting
small, thinking thoroughly, and combining patience with persistence.  I
mean, if somebody came to me and said, "how can I get to be truly wealthy
or truly successful," I would say literally, "start small, think things
through thoroughly and combine patience with persistence." That is,
patience is not being inactive.  Patience is being very active, but being
patiently very active.  Not allowing the frustration to stop you.
Entrepreneurship is a learned skill.
<P>
And again, I recommend -- I go back to Drucker's "Effective Executive." As
all of you know, I mention it often enough.  If you wanted to be an
entrepreneur, I'd start with "the Effective Executive," because the core
lessons of effectiveness are absolutely vital if you're going to be an
entrepreneur.  You combine this with a visionary sense of wanting to get
something done, a very strong ego, and a willingness to work very, very
hard.
<P>
Now let's look at one of the great entrepreneurs of our time, a man who
you'll be surprised as you see this how many things you relate to that he's
involved in, Norman Brinker.  I just want you to just listen to this and
maybe make notes about what you learn as you listen to it.
<P>
>>Whether it's his beloved game of polo or his magical success in business,<br>
>>Norman Brinker simply does not know how to lose.  Since he began running<br>
>>the Chili's restaurant chain in 1983, annual sales have soared from 30<br>
>>million to $500 million.  Before that, he turned around Burger King.  He<br>
>>ran Bennigan's, and, of course, he founded Steak and Ale.<br>
<br><br>
>>Ron McDougall: Norm is like one of these living legends they have in<br>
>>business.  There's very few of them around.  One of the things I learned<br>
>>from Norm is that you never stop trying, and you're not afraid to take a<br>
>>risk.  You try things.  If they don't work, you come back and try it<br>
>>again or you improve it, modify it, and attack again.<br>
<br>
>>Ross Perot: you walk into one of his restaurants and you can see<br>
>>everybody's faces just light up, and you realize that he treats people as<br>
>>equals, he treats people with dignity and respect.  He gets the very best<br>
>>out of people by treating them fairly.<br>
<br>
>>Who are we going to play first?  Him first, Uno?<br>
<br>
>>though horses have always been Brinker's first love, it was ironically<br>
>>the love of a horse that taught him how to be a good businessman when he<br>
>>was just a boy in Roswell, New Mexico.<br>
<br>
>>I can recall in the first grade where my friends were interested in<br>
>>bicycles, I was interested in -- I was interested in horses.  And was<br>
>>bound and determined someday to own a horse.  And so I went to work, I<br>
>>think, when I was 9 on a paper route in order to make some money to buy a<br>
>>horse.<br>
<br>
>>in 1964, after a management stint at Jack in the Box, he left to open his<br>
>>first restaurant, Brink's coffee shop in Dallas.<br>
<br>
>>Pete Schenkel: I can remember Norman waiting on tables in there.  He was<br>
>>the cashier, he was the cook.<br>
<br>
>>I knew Mr. .  Brinker.  He's nice.<br>
<br>
>>Pete Schenkel: he has enthusiasm that's just bubbling from the time he<br>
>>gets up in the morning until the time he goes to bed at night.<br>
<br>
>>Norman's enthusiasm led him to bigger things.  He started a restaurant<br>
>>chain called Steak and Ale.  He taught his waiters and waitresses to<br>
>>introduce themselves in a way that would soon be copied nationwide in the<br>
>>restaurant business.<br>
<br>
>>good afternoon.  My name is Mike.  I'm going to be your waiter today.<br>
<br>
>>Hi.<br>
<br>
>>How are you doing?<br>
<br>
>>Doing fine, thanks.<br>
<br>
>>At Steak and Ale, Brinker also created the first salad bar in a<br>
>>restaurant, which again would set a national trend.<br>
<br>
>>Norman Brinker: so I said okay, if I have a salad bar, that means as soon<br>
>>as you take an order, the customer can get up and get to a salad bar so<br>
>>he won't have to say, "well, what's happening? " And it avoided getting<br>
>>into the bread and butter appetizer business.<br>
<br>
>>Steak and Ale was an amazing success story.  It grew to 102 restaurants<br>
>>in 10 years and was worth $102 million when he sold it to the Pillsbury<br>
>>corporation in 1976.  As chairman of the Pillsbury restaurant group,<br>
>>Brinker oversaw such chains as Bennigan's and Burger King.  In the early<br>
>>'80s, Brinker led Burger King in a burger war against McDonald's, and<br>
>>eventually tripled the chain's profits.<br>
<br>
>>Norman Brinker: I learned early on that excitement makes a lot of<br>
>>difference in this business.  I'm not in the food business.  I'm in the<br>
>>entertainment business.  I'm in the fashion business, if you will, and we<br>
>>happen to serve food.<br>
<br>
>>despite his hectic schedule, Norman finds the time to meet with young<br>
>>people just beginning their career.<br>
<br>
>>Norman, what do you tell that 29-year-old who's worried about life right<br>
>>now?  What do you tell him or her is at the end of the entrepreneurial<br>
>>rainbow?<br>
<br>
>>Well, well, I tell them that there -- the neat thing about being an<br>
>>entrepreneur, there's no end to the rainbow.  It can go on into your 80s.<br>
>>But what I tell them, if you want to get there, you need to do a few<br>
>>things.  One is to know who you are, what you are, and what you really do<br>
>>enjoy.  You can't go "say, I'm going to do something because it makes a<br>
>>lot of money." You may do something -- if you go do something you are<br>
>>really good at, then the money may come.  And then I say, you ought to<br>
>>set a clear-cut set of goals to accomplish what you want and become very<br>
>>-- the very best in that line of business, and then go do something on<br>
>>your own.  And also, benchmarks along the way so that you know -- the<br>
>>people know who have accomplished a great deal is step by step by step.<br>
>>I see these people wandering around who are waiting for that big deal.<br>
>>That never happens.  It's step by step by step.<br>
<br>
>>so what do you all think?<br>
<br>
>>I've never heard the name before.<br><br>

>>Huh?<br><br>

>>That's wild.<br><br>

>>Why is it wild?<br><br>

>>I just had never heard the name before.  I didn't realize he was<br>
>>associated with all those things.<br>
<br>
>>Sounds like what my dad used to say, work hard.  Nothing's free.  Just<br>
>>work for it slow and steady.<br>
<br>
>>How about the rest of you?  What is your reaction?<br><br>

>>well, he had a vision for a restaurant, and he was willing to take his<br>
>>time, bide his time, and, well, as we said just a second ago,<br>
>>persistence, and persistence paid off.  Look at what he's got.<br>
<br>
>>Wasn't his real vision to own a horse?<br>
<br>
>>yeah.  What did he say was the most important -- I mean, I think this one<br>
>>tape could be an entire class.<br>
<br>
>>I believe he said the most important thing was to enjoy it.<br><br>

>> right.<br><br>

>>Enjoy what you're doing.<br><br>

>>Notice how this breaks out of all of the regulatory -- I mean, think<br>
>>about how we do first grade, second grade, third grade, you are a child,<br>
>>don't be an adult.  I mean, look at Brinker, and we've seen this in a<br>
>>couple of other cases.  When does Brinker start growing up?  Huh?<br>
<br>
>>Never.<br><br>

>>When there's something he wants.<br><br>

>>What did you say?<br><br>

>>I said, "never." I think he's still a kid.<br><br>

>>that's right.  On the one hand he's still a kid, and yet when did he<br>
>>start doing what we think of as an adult thing?<br>
<br>
>>9 years old.<br>
<br>
>>9.  At 9 years of age he gets his first job, so that you can say, "oh,<br>
>>gee, we've sure made him become an adult too early, and I'll bet he's a<br>
>>workaholic and he's terribly repressed." On the other, hand what is he<br>
>>doing in the film?  He's running around playing with ponies.  I mean, I<br>
>>saw Brinker three weeks ago.  He'd hurt his leg again playing polo.  But<br>
>>notice how different this is from the regulatory, organized,<br>
>>control-dominated welfare state model.  Here is a guy who is a kid in his<br>
>>50s or 60s and was an adult at 9.  And that's not right.  I mean, you<br>
>>have to choose, because remember, go back to the model.  It's static,<br>
>>orderly, planable.  And yet why did he do it?  For a pony.  Can you<br>
>>imagine the adults who will say, "well, that's a silly reason to work."<br>
>>Wasn't.  That's what he wanted.  In a free society, he was pursuing<br>
>>happiness at 9 years of age.  Notice how inventive he is.<br>
<br>
Somebody said to me the other day, six million people work in restaurants
he helped create ormanage.  Now, he wouldn't count as a job creator, of
course.  He's just some rich guy playing polo.  But just think about the
notion.  And think about the inventions.  How much money would you guess we
make from Japan out of Burger King?  It's a substantial currency earner for
us, as is McDonald's and as is the others.
<P>
My point here is a couple.  I mean, I want to really try to show you how
different the model is.  One, people ought to work in terms of their own
voluntary doing things so they have money, so they get to play games they
want when they want to, as early as they want to.  I am not calling for the
end of child labor laws, okay?
<P>
>>Sounds like it.
<P>
>>Right.  I mean, I just want to make clear, because otherwise they'll be<br>
>>grotesquely distorted.  But think about what Brinker's saying here.  Two,<br>
>>what should you do?  You ought to do what you like doing, so people say,<br>
>>"I need to go see a career counselor." Maybe.  Maybe you just need to go<br>
>>get a career.  How will you know it's the career you'll want?  You'll go<br>
>>try it.  Notice his attitude towards innovation.  What did the other guy<br>
>>say?  Try it.  I mean, don't hire 12 consultants, think about it for<br>
>>three and a half years, and maybe do it.  You've got a good idea, go try<br>
>>it.  If it works, keep it.  If it doesn't work, rethink it.  Remember the<br>
>>Edison line the other week about the first 4,000 experiments?  It was not<br>
>>a failure.  What did he say?<br>
<br>
>>a good start.<br><br>

>>And why?<br><br>

>>Because those were 4,000 things that he knew didn't work.<br><br>

>>right, 4,000 things you know won't work, so we're beginning to narrow it<br>
>>down.  Notice the psychological attitude.  Very entrepreneurial.  I have<br>
>>a good friend of mine, Tom Kershaw, who owns the Hampshire house, which<br>
>>is the site of "Cheers" in Boston.  He was a engineer with an MBA from<br>
>>Harvard doing engineering MBA things, and he wasn't happy, and he went to<br>
>>see a guy and he said, "I'm not happy." And the guy said, "what do you<br>
>>like to do? " And he said, "you mean -- what do you mean? " He said,<br>
>>"tell me, what do you like to do? " He said, "I love hanging out with<br>
>>people, you know, and when I get off work, I go and I hang out with<br>
>>people." And the guy said, "so why aren't you hanging out with people?" <br>
>>He said, "because that's what I do after work." And the guy said, "but is<br>
>>it what you like doing? " He said, "yeah.  "I love it.  "and I thrive on<br>
>>it.  "it's me." He said, "so where might you hang out with people? " So<br>
>>he opened a bar and restaurant.  He opened the first discotheque in the<br>
>>United States.  I mean, he opened the Hawk and -- or the Bull and Finch,<br>
>>which is the site of "Cheers," and he was doing reasonably well, and then<br>
>>"Cheers" came along and then he was doing disgustingly well.  But he's<br>
>>doing well at what he likes doing.<br>
<br>
Now, why is that important?  Because -- this is, again, one of the things
you can't get across in a welfare state -doing anything well is
time-consuming and hard.  There are no serious things worth doing that you
can do easily.  That, by the way, is a great speech by Tom Hanks in "a
League of Their Own" at the very end of the movie.  It's well worth renting
the movie just to see that one speech.  So if you're going to do something
really well, you're going to have to do it a lot.  If you're going to have
to do it a lot, you'd better like it or you're going to hate your life.
And that means you've got to have courage to just go be yourself.  Now,
being yourself doesn't mean, you know, leaning back and saying, "well,
world, take care of me, because after all, I'm me." It means energetically,
aggressively live your life out being you in a way which is productive.
And "productive" doesn't have to mean you want to get rich.
<P>
But you should -- you should make consistent series of deals with yourself
where you, as a mature adult, this includes at 9, you want a pony?  Work.
There ain't nothing wrong with that.  Except, of course -- and we'll get
into this next week -- if you're in the welfare system and you work and you
save for the pony, they take the money because it's illegal.  You put your
family in the wrong class.  This happened in Wisconsin to a woman who'd
saved $3,000 for her daughter's education.  They forced her to spend the
money.  So it's a totally -- I cannot overstate it is a totally different
world view.  The entrepreneurial, world market oriented, dynamic system is
a totally different world view from the static, passive, and regulated
welfare state.  And it's not about little changes down here.  It's about a
fundamentally different way of doing things.
<P>
Let me put it differently, entrepreneurship is a whole range of skills,
attitudes, habits, and knowledge.  It's a complete package.  It's like
trying to learn to be a ballerina or trying to learn to be a football
quarterback and saying, "okay, practice throwing your arm." That's not what
it is.  It's a totality of things.  Or practicing standing on one leg to be
a ballerina.  That's not what it is.  It's a totality.  It's a gestalt.
Bureaucrats focus on control and process.  Entrepreneurs focus on
liberating, creating, solving, they focus on results.  It's hard to get
more different.  Bureaucrats see a static world in which numbers count.
Entrepreneurs see a dynamic world in which people count.
<P>
So bureaucrats in the static world are very risk averse; whereas, Norman
Brinker figures, hey, people are resilient.  Go try it out.  If it doesn't
work, get up off the ground and try it again.  You'll survive.  It's a
totally different mind set.  The welfare state's despised low-paying job is
the entrepreneur's great learning opportunity, first rung on the ladder of
opportunity.  It is a beginning, not an ending.  It is dynamic, not a trap.
And it is hopeful, not depressing.
<P>
I mean, you can't get a -- all of you've heard the phrase said with
contempt, "oh, that's just a hamburger flipping job." That sentence said
that way tells you everything about which world view the person's in.  That
is a static, welfare state world.  Because, in fact, to say, "wow, I got my
first job, I'm on my way," doesn't matter what your first job is.  It
matters where your first job leads.
<P>
Now, to prove that, let me give you another example, and that is a really
interesting film that McDonald's did.  McDonald's is the largest job
training system in the world.  More people learn how to work at McDonald's
than anywhere else in the world.  But, I mean, literally when you walk in
the door.  Let's show the McDonald's thing.
<P>
>>Teri Goudie: the day I walked in there to apply for the job, I must have<br>
>>walked by the place six times.  I was 15 and a half, very shy.  When I<br>
>>went in and I got the job, I think it was the first notch in my<br>
>>self-confidence.  It helped me bring it out of it.<br>
<br>
>> William Morris: I worked at several McDonald's.  I worked as a<br>
>>16-year-old.  I had my first job at a McDonald's, and then I worked my<br>
>>way through college at McDonald's, and then after we were married and had<br>
>>our first child, I supplemented my income working in a McDonald's.<br>
<br>
>>Michael Perez: if I wasn't in the entertainment field, I would definitely<br>
>>seek a position at McDonald's.<br>
<br>
>>Michelle Sarkesian: the manager that I worked with was really nice.  He<br>
>>was really flexible for me as far as when I needed to work.  "oh, come in<br>
>>when you can.  "we'll arrange, you know, the schedule."<br>
<br>
>>I learned how to coordinate things, just teamwork, you know.  That was<br>
>>very important at McDonald's.  Everything was like one, two, three,<br>
>>clockwork.  And I learned a lot of responsibility as a person and<br>
>>responsibility as far as coping with others.<br>
<br>
>>Brian Welch: McDonald's showed me a lot of responsibility and teamwork,<br>
>>which is important as a firefighter and cooking hamburgers.<br>
<br>
>>Tim Wilcox: benefits that I derived from working at McDonald's was<br>
>>primarily a steady income in order to pay my bills so I could eventually<br>
>>become an airline pilot so I could go through flight school and college.<br>
>>Second, it was a flexible working schedule where they worked their<br>
>>schedule around me.  And third most, it was fun.  I still keep in touch<br>
>>with the people I worked with back then as now, and we're still as good<br>
>>friends after working two years together.<br>
<br>
>>I've served in the Illinois Senate, I served as mayor of a major city in<br>
>>Illinois, and I now work as an officer in one of the major banks in the<br>
>>country, and in all of those careers, McDonald's experience is an<br>
>>important part of the fabric of my life.  It taught me things that I've<br>
>>been able to use, and obviously, working in government and politics and<br>
>>now in sort of a sales role, it helped me learn how to identify people,<br>
>>see what their interest is, and try to deal with that interest.<br>
<br>
>>And no matter what you're going to go into, what career you're going to<br>
>>decide upon, the principles you learn there you can take anywhere.  And<br>
>>you can learn a lot by the corporation as a whole, to watch how they do<br>
>>their day-to-day business.  And the managers will let you in on that.<br>
>>They'll show you how they do the books.  They'll show you how to do<br>
>>inventory.  I was exposed to all those things so when I went into the<br>
>>corporate world, I didn't feel like I was a stranger to it.<br>
<br>
>>What's the first thing you learn in your first job?  What's the most<br>
>>important -- what's the most important first thing?<br>
<br>
>>responsibility.<br>
<br>
>>Show up for work.<br><br>

>>To show up.  Again, to show up.  See, again, this is one of the things<br>
>>that academics and the welfare state don't get.  Most of what you have to<br>
>>learn is not preprinted in some neat, orderly program done by a Ph. D. .<br>
>>I say this even though I'm a Ph. D. .  Most of it is learned in the<br>
>>richness and depth of life.  Number one thing about going to work is<br>
>>going to work.  What's the number two thing about going to work?<br>
<br>
>>going to work again.<br><br>

>>No.<br><br>

>>Carrying out tasks.<br><br>

>>Huh?<br><br>

>>Going to work again.<br><br>

>>Carrying out your tasks.<br><br>

>>Carrying out your tasks, because -- and this is very important if you've<br>
>>never -- and this is one of the things we don't get, which we'll get into<br>
>>next week, about how do you replace the culture of poverty with the<br>
>>culture of productivity.  First you've got to learn, I don't feel good.<br>
>>Go to work.  But I'm having a big fight with my girlfriend.  Go to work.<br>
>>My boss wasn't nice to me yesterday.  Go to work.  The customer didn't<br>
>>respect me and appreciate the way I gave them the hamburger.  Go to work.<br>
>>Learn.  Grow up.  Now I'm at work.  I don't feel like being at work.  I<br>
>>want to go talk to my girlfriend who I am fighting with.  Stay at work.<br>
<br><br>
My older daughter went to work for Delta several summers.  One of the first
-- and it's great.  I watched her grow.  I watched her go through this.
And she had this wonderful guy who probably was totally politically
incorrect, although he was probably saved because he was black.  But he was
physically huge.  My daughter's not.  She's about five- four.  And he said
to her the first week, "you show up or I'll kill you." This is clearly a
litigatable statement.  Kathy said to me, "I'm convinced, I'm showing up."
I'm not -- and they had a rule, one of the jobs she had that summer down at
the Atlanta airport was she met the 5-year-old who was flying who had to
change planes.  Losing the 5-year-old was an automatic fireable offense.
And it was very -- but think about this, because it's so opposite of the
welfare state mentality.  They had to get into this college kid's head,
we're really serious about this.  You can't lose a 5-year-old in the middle
of an airport.  The child could get killed.  They could get kidnapped.  Bad
things could happen to them.  Hold their hand.  Don't talk to your
girlfriend.  Don't think about your boyfriend.  Pay attention to the little
kid.
<P>
Now, when you're 18, 19 years of age or more, you're 16, you've grown up in
poverty, nobody near you has ever had a job, you don't know anybody who's
been to work every day and stayed all day.  There is no one in your
personal experience who's done it.  The first thing you've got to do is
have a job.  Any job beats a theoretical academic, let me hold your hand, I
hope you'll come most mornings, 70% is a passing grade.  I mean, what's a
passing grade at McDonald's?  It's close to 100%, isn't it?  You walk in,
you say, "I want an Egg McMuffin." Guess what you want?  I mean, what's
your reaction if you say, "I want an Egg McMuffin and they give you
something else?  It's 100% wrong, right?  So anything below 100% is a
failing grade.
<P>
Now, they've been through the school system where if you have 65% but your
grandmother's been sick and you've really got a good excuse and, well,
we'll give you a "C" because we don't want to make you feel bad.  You go
into the real world of real business where you're dealing with real money
and real customers, it's 100%.  And, now, nobody's 100%, so it's 99. 97.
But it ain't much slack.  Now, when you're on the customer side, you don't
give any slack.  Isn't that right?  I mean, what's your reaction?  You want
your order and then you give them cash.  You want the exact change.  You
don't want within 5%.  Hey, an "A's" within 5%.  Why are you mad at me?
<P>
I mean, just think about it.  The whole academic setting is nuts in terms
of teaching people about the real world of interacting in the real
marketplace, and so what happens?  You create the first hamburger flipping
job.  The kid shows up.  At a McDonald's, they don't start by flipping
hamburgers.  They start by cleaning the place up.  Now you've reduced them
to a janitor.  How can you have -- how can you lack dignity and be out
there pushing a broom?  And the answer, of course, is if you're smart,
because it is the first step to a career in which you'll know how to go to
work, you'll know how to earn a living, you'll know how to work in a team,
you'll know how to manage others, you'll know how to deal with customers,
and what's the result?  You'll have a better future.  But unless you have a
dynamic view in which you see life taking off, if you have a static view,
"we've now trapped this poor person and they're not going to ever have any
future at all because you forced them to go to work," and that's sort of
the core distinction.
<P>
It's a very deep distinction.  And when we come back after the break, we're
going to look at, how does this apply to America in the world market?
<P>
(break)
<P>
>>All right.  Let me recap for a second the notion of the entrepreneurial<br>
>>dynamic model in which we emphasize growth and learning and focusing on<br>
>>the future.  You can summarize it, I think, pretty simply.  It's not who<br>
>>you are today, it's who you want to be tomorrow that counts in America.<br>
>>And I, frankly, would argue that when we pick up on welfare next week and<br>
>>on the culture of poverty, that that's the core weakness in the way we<br>
>>deal with the problem today.<br>
<br>
We don't emphasize with people, tell us who you want to be.  Don't tell us
about your problems.  Don't tell us about your past.  Don't tell us about
your weaknesses.  Tell us who you want to be, and now let's figure out what
strengths and skills you need to get to be that person, and let's go to
work on them.  It's a very different attitude.  It's an attitude of
opportunity focus rather than victim.  Excuse me.
<br><br>
Now, at the vision level, what we're suggesting is that a successful
America will have the highest value-added jobs with the greatest
productivity leading to the greatest take-home pay, and the greatest job
security.  That is, the way you get job security is not by blocking the
world market, it's by winning in the world market.  Let me put it a little
differently.  And I think that Morris Schechtman's book "Working Without a
Net" -- which I've told him I think is mistitled.  I think he's really
talking about creating your own net rather than relying on big systems for
a net.  But his idea's essentially right, and that is that real security is
based on real productivity and real economic growth.
<P>
So real security is based on real change.  It's the security of a kayaker
in a white water river who is paying attention and negotiating the changes.
It's very different from what people think of.  People really say, "gee,
can I build a castle where I can stop and rest? " And the answer's no.
What you can do is you can think through and you can build assets and you
can build resources, and obviously, if you're prudent and careful, you can
build a lot of resources for your old age.  But during your working years,
you have to dynamically interface with a world that is changing.
<P>
One of the ways to measure that is to look at how in each generation who is
succeeding changes.  For example, if you looked at Henry Ford in 1905, or
Alfred Sloan in 1922, or Bill Gates today, each of them, in a sense, was a
man of the future, but the question is, who's tomorrow's men of the future?
Gates is now an established figure.  He's been around for 10 or 12 years.
He's, in a sense, yesterday's great success story.  Not that he's not
important, not that he's not powerful, but Microsoft is now in some ways
what IBM was 30 years ago.
<P>
So what's the next Microsoft?  And it may well be in biotechnology,
frankly.  But it's this concept that what you're always looking for is not
some static academic, planned, structured investment.  What you're looking
for is the dynamic, creative, entrepreneurial energy and drive that meets
the marketplace, and what you want to do, in a sense, is given this vision
of winning in the world market, creating local jobs through world sales,
you need to set up a series of strategies.
<P>
Now, what we're trying to do now is build strategies that come out of our
vision, which is an entrepreneurial vision, so the strategies will be very
different than the strategies that bureaucrats and academics would create
in a welfare state vision.  It's very important to understand why they're
so different.  Remember I drew earlier, and I want to go back and remind
you.  The core theme here, and the same thing will come up next week, is
that the vision is dramatically different up here at the top.  Therefore,
the strategies, even if they look similar, are, in fact, relating to a very
different vision.  Therefore, the projects, even if they might be identical
in form, are inside of different strategies, which relate to a different
vision.
<P>
And so finally, what you're doing tactically, for example, presumably even
in a welfare state restaurant you would be nice when the customer walked
in, presumably, although you might take the attitude of a government-run
cafeteria and compare it to the attitude of a restaurant where if they're
not nice, you don't come back.  But presumably, they would try to create
the same tactic.  Please be nice to the customer.  Please wash the plates.
<P>

But the whole underlying model of reward and incentive, the whole
expectation, is different in the two systems.  One of the strategies is to
reward success at job creation and keep resources with job creators.
<P>
Now, this refers back both to the lessons of American history and to
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  That what you want to do is you want to
reward success at job creation, you want to keep resources with job
creators.  It also means, in terms of looking back at personal strength as
a pillar, what you'll say to people is, if you don't have a job right now,
have you considered creating one?  Have you considered calling Amway or
Tupperware or Mary Kay or beauty control or any one over 100 systems?  Have
you considered going out and starting your own small business?
<P>
But don't say automatically, I can't get a job, there is no job, I'm
hopeless.  Please let me be a victim for a while.  Totally different
attitudes.  Second, you want to strengthen the family for an economic
reason, families create human capital.  The most important bankers in
development are families.  Because somebody comes to you and says, I need a
little bit of money to finish college, or I need a little bit of money to
open up my store, or I need a little bit of money to do something else.
<P>
Why do we see such a rapid rise of Asian families?  Because they are
extended networks of capital accumulation.  You can have 20 or 30 or 40
families that say, cousin, you know, Sam has got a great idea.  Let's each
of us kick in a little bit.  And then cousin Sam does well, and now cousin
Sam is part of the extended bank.  It's a family bank.  And so extended fami
lies and strong families are major sources of capital development.  And by
the way, guess where most learning takes place?  Inside the family.
<P>
So when you see the collapse of the family and when you see a society which
tolerates totally self-centered, destructive parents, I mean, parents who
have not got a clue why they're parenting, that haven't got a clue how to
educate their child, they haven't got a clue about being responsible and
you tolerate that, and you think, "well, that poor victim," who is, of
course, now creating new victims, you are cheating yourself of a major
capital resource, which is the human beings of the next generation.  So
when you end up with kids who don't know how to clean up after themselves,
don't know how to study, don't know how to be disciplined, don't know how
to be nice to anybody, don't know how to interact with other human beings
and have had nobody in their immediate family do anything to teach them,
the burden you put on the school system is hopeless.
<P>
Because most learning doesn't occur in a classroom.  Most learning occurs
in a family environment and in a neighborhood environment.  And until we
are honest about that, we're not going to solve it.  Now, if you really
want loss of jobs -- and this is exactly counter-intuitive to the welfare
state.  It's the exact opposite of the welfare state.  If you really want
lots of jobs, what you do is you cut taxes on job creation.  You really
want to increase the employment factor for the marginally unemployed, for
black inner city kids and American Indians on a reservation, and poor
whites in west Virginia?  Cut out all the taxes.  Say, you hire that
person, you don't have to pay FICA.  You don't have to pay income tax.  You
don't have to pay unemployment compensation.  Just pay them straight.  You
see, the minimum wage isn't the minimum wage.  Minimum wage is gross pay,
and it's not real cost, because you have to add all the extra taxes.
<P>
Jim Longley told me the other day, the congressman from Maine, that there
are nine taxes in Maine when you hire somebody.  So you're paying the
surface amount plus the other taxes, and the person isn't even getting the
surface amount, and so if you really wanted to hire the hard-core
unemployed, you'd say, for anybody who fits in this zone, there are no
taxes if you hire them.  And overnight they become more employable.
Because the cost of walking in the door and teaching them what we talked
about the last hour -- show up, stay here, serve the customer, work with
the rest of the team -- the cost would drop dramatically, and so you could
begin to afford to bring them on board.  But notice how counter-intuitive
it is to say, in terms of the welfare state, let's cut taxes on the very
entrepreneurs, who are the people that the welfare state most wants to tax.
And yet if you want to create jobs, what you say to people is, go create
jobs.  If you're a big winner, if you employ 3,000 people, we'll make you a
big winner.  And suddenly you have an explosion of human energy trying to
find a way to have more people at work.  Similarly, you want to reward
investments and productivity.
<P>
I mean, how do you compete in the world market?  You have the most
productive work force.  I recently did a TV show with one of the wealthiest
men in Mexico, and I said -- you know, he said he wanted to go into the
beeper business, you know, where somebody - - does anybody here have a
beeper?  Okay, you've got one here, a pager, over there, okay.  I said, "so
are you going to manufacture them? " He said, "no." He said, "we can't
afford to." That the beepers are now made so efficiently in the U. S.  --
which is what the Japanese also discovered.  It's why Motorola dominates
the Japanese market, that we're going to buy American beepers, pagers.
<P>
Now, if you reward investments and productivity and you dominate
production, if you make it cheap to be productive, you have a whole
different attitude, which means you want very low taxes on investment, you
want very low taxes on new machinery.  You want very low taxes on new
computers and new software.  So you can have the finest inventory control
in the world.  It's a totally different attitude than, well, they're making
money.  Let's raise their taxes.  That's a source of money.  Sure it's a
source of money.  What it does is you then slow down the very investments
that make you productive that allow you to hire people that create the
jobs.
<P>
You want to encourage entrepreneurs and job creation by giving
self-employed and small business the same tax breaks as big business.  We
currently do two or three examples that are just -- I mean, you have to
wonder how out of touch with reality we could be.  Big business, you buy
health insurance.  You get 100% deductibility.  Until last week, you bought
insurance as a small business, you got no deductibility.  We passed 25%
deductibility.  It ought to be 100.  Big business has all sorts of tax
breaks that little businesses can never get to be large enough to take
advantage of.  The home office deduction.
<P>
If you're going into a Third Wave information age, you should be
encouraging the home office deduction.  Instead, we're piling so much red
tape on it, we discourage it.  I was told by somebody the other day that it
almost guarantees you'll be audited if you list a home office.  That's the
opposite of sound behavior.  So you want to think about, how do you reward
the kind of investments, and how do you reward them for the self-employed,
for the person who's out there on their own?  We probably ought to design a
system where the self-employed have an I. R. A.  That is their version of
unemployment compensation.  In other words, you want to literally make it
easy to build your own safety net.  Which is the opposite of welfare state
policies, which is to raise your taxes so the bureaucracy has the money so
the bureaucracy decides whether or not you're safe.
<P>
Now, you want to encourage entrepreneurial learning.  That's why I strongly
favor, for summer teenage employment, that they work at real jobs in real
businesses.  I mean, if my choice is to give the money to the city
recreation program to have them come and play basketball or to give the
same money and vouchers to small businesses to hire them to do real work, I
want them, as teenagers, learning to do real work.  I want them in real
businesses, dealing with real customers, working for a real boss, learning
how to keep -- you know, and it's because it's not a just for me.
<P>
And again, I'm not undervaluing.  I mean, my son-in-law's a coach, and I
believe deeply in the value of sports, and I learned a great number of
things playing high school football that helped me get through my whole
career.  There are lots of things you can learn playing sports.  I'm for
playing sports.  But I'm even more for making summer employment real.  And
that doesn't mean just, you know, painting down at city hall because your
cousin the city councilman got you a cushy job.  I'm talking about getting
people out there in the real world, dealing with real customers, and
learning something that's very, very different.
<P>
It also means, I think, reestablishing apprenticeships in a big way.  We
have taken far too much of learning out of the marketplace and put it into
academic environments.  There are a tremendous number of things you learn
best by being an apprentice because they're too complicated, they're too
much a matter of judgment to learn them in a classroom.  The classroom
breaks things down and makes it artificial.  Makes it too easy, for one
thing.  It makes it too slow, and people like Michelangelo were
apprentices.  I mean he became a great sculptor and great artist because he
was apprentice to one of the great artists of his time.  Benjamin Franklin
was an apprentice.
<P>
And there's a great virtue, I think, to rebonding entrepreneurs to the
young by having apprenticeships that may start as early as 16 or 17.  If
you have somebody who isn't good in an academic setting and they don't like
sitting around and they don't want to take notes and they won't do their
homework, maybe part of the answer is to figure out an apprenticeship where
they go out and they do real work and earn real money, and then at 25 they
decide to go to night school or they go to weekend school.  But you want to
get them into doing things in a structured environment with a master
craftsman or a master -- and the master craftsman may just run the dry
cleaner, but learning to run a dry cleaner to earn a living is a heck of a
lot better than being a dropout sitting on the street corner.  So it's a
totally different way of seeing things.
<P>
Another thing we ought to do absolutely is change unemployment compensation
to retraining.  We should not give money to people so that they can bass
fish and deer hunt.  I mean, if you don't have a job and you need
unemployment compensation, fine, what are you going to learn during the
week that we're paying you?  And if you're not willing to learn something,
why are we paying you?
<P>
I think it's very important conceptually that you've got to have this
attitude of saying to people, we're going to have a partnership, but you
have to be involved in it.  You have to have a responsibility for it.  If
you look at it from that standpoint, let's look at workmen's comp.
<P>
We ought to turn workmen's compensation into assessment, retraining, and
investment.  Today, all too often, workmen's comp is the lawyer's gravy
train to file the suit to get money for the person who then expects to do
nothing.  You can't have a healthy society where you are -- where you're
encouraging litigation and where more money goes to the administrative
process than goes to rehabilitation.  What you want to say to somebody --
and by the way, very often the lawyer will say, "don't go and get
rehabilitated until after we're done with the trial."
<P>
Now, I want you to think about how dumb this is.  I mean, how dumb is it to
say -- if I can draw down here without confusing you for a second -here is
an accident right here.  What we should do is the next day, we should
assess and begin rehabilitation.  Instead, in the welfare state model,
first you have to go to trial.  So we have delayed fixing your problem so
that your problem may well get substantially worse or you may harden into
it.  You've lost all this intermediate income, because after all, you have
to prove that you have to be -that you've had this problem.
<P>
So even though we live in a computer age where we probably can retrain you
and you probably can be back productively at work in a relatively short
time, and you probably could get modest compensation, but the primary
purpose of workmen's comp was not to get you compensation.  It was to get
you an ability to get retrained and rehabilitated.  So this is exactly the
opposite of common sense.  I mean, take --
<P>
>>excuse me for interrupting, but -- and at the same time, as the employer,<br>
>>I'm being taxed and beaten to death for my insurance company to turn back<br>
>>around and just settle out of court.<br>
<P>
>>Right.
<P>
>>My rates go up, and nothing has happened.  We're still waiting to go to
trial.
<P>
>>What you should have is immediate rehabilitation.  Now, rehabilitation<br>
>>means you pay the doctor, you pay the therapist, you might buy a computer<br>
>>or you might buy whatever equipment they need.  Those dollars today go to<br>
>>the bureaucrat and the lawyer.<br><br>

>>they get paid first.<br><br>

>>Not in that order either.<br><br>

>>Not in that order, right.  Well, the bureaucrat actually is there all the<br>
>>time, so they get their money.<br>

>>let's go back one, though.  Isn't unemployment -- isn't that moneys that<br>
>>have already been paid by the employee?<br>
<br>
>>right.<br><br>

>>And if that is the case, isn't it inherently wrong to make them work<br>
>>twice for the money that they've already earned once?<br>
<br>
>>no.  Because we compel you to pay a tax collectively.  It's not money you<br>
>>personally -- we compel people to pay a tax collectively into an<br>
>>insurance fund for unemployment.  And my point to you is, if the goal of<br>
>>that fund is to help you get employment, I mean, it's not called the<br>
>>"vacation fund."<br><br>

>>Right.  No, I understand, that but by the same token, if you've paid into<br>
>>unemployment all your life and you find yourself unemployed and you're<br>
>>going to go bass fishing for three months, collect your unemployment<br>
>>before you're ready to come back into it.<br><br>

>>You didn't pay it.  Your employer paid it.<br><br>

>>you didn't pay it.  And everybody around you paid it.  Why should we as a<br>
>>society -- I mean, look, if you want us to set up a bass fishing fund,<br>
>>I'm not against bass fishing.  I mean, dick is a close friend of mine,<br>
>>fishes all the time.  I'm not personally into bass fishing, but I'm not<br>
>>against it, but we don't have a bass fishing fund.<br><br>

>>Right.  I understand --<br><br>

>>we have an unemployment compensation -- let me tell you how I got to<br>
>>this.  At villa Rica high school about eight, nine years ago, I went to a<br>
>>graduation, a man walked up to me after graduation and he said, "my<br>
>>daughter graduated tonight.  "I'm glad your here." He said, "I worked at<br>
>>the General Motors plant at Lakewood.  "they laid me off four years ago,<br>
>>and "they paid me supplemental pay, which was 95% for four years.  "and I<br>
>>thought that the plant would re-open.  "and now it's not going to<br>
>>re-open, and my supplemental pay runs out in two months.  "what should I<br>
>>do? " The signal we had sent to him was, wait.<br><br>

>>Right.<br><br>

>>Okay, in other words, let me try to draw it differently for a second.<br>
>>Okay, laid off.  In the old days, the theory was you got -- and it was<br>
>>actually a game rigged by the unions and by the big manufacturers.  You<br>
>>could have unemployment compensation so the government would pay you<br>
>>during the layoff until you were recalled, okay?  This assumes a national<br>
>>cyclical model where your company's not downsizing.  That is, it assumed,<br>
>>"oh, we'll be off for six weeks.  "let's go bass fishing."<br><br>

>>Right.<br><br>

>>You don't live in that world anymore.  Your job may be gone.  And we<br>
>>can't afford to spend money on you unless we get something for the money,<br>
>>and that fund is a government fund.  This is a tax.  This is not your<br>
>>voluntary vacation fund.  This is a compulsory tax.<br>
<br>
>>But unemployment still should be discernible from welfare.
<br><br>
>> of course it should.
<br><br>
>>Okay.
<br><br>
>>But my point is, if we're going to give you -- if you need unemployment<br>
>>compensation, you should use the free time you now have, because by<br>
>>definition, you're unemployed --<br>
<br>
>>right.
<br><br>
>>-- You should use that time to learn something.  If you are not learning<br>
>>something, we are wasting our capital base, because this person comes<br>
>>over to here, there is no recall.  Now they turn to you and say, "gee, I<br>
>>just got four" -- in this case it was four years, and most of the time<br>
>>it's 26 weeks -- "I just got 26 weeks of money paid for by a tax fund.<br>
>>"I didn't do anything.  "now would you please retrain me? " Well, why are<br>
>>we wasting 26 weeks of your life, and why are we wasting 26 weeks of tax<br>
>>money and not retraining you starting right here?  Because our assumption<br>
>>has to be that every adult has to learn their whole life.  Which is a<br>
>>totally different model.  The old model was, "hey, I've already learned<br>
>>to work in the steel mill.  "why are you bothering?  "the steel mill will<br>
>>re-open in a couple weeks and I'll go back to work." This was the classic<br>
>>industrial cycle for about 80 years.  It died in the '80s.  The world<br>
>>market crushed it.  And now you're into a totally different model where<br>
>>people -- because of the information age, people are going to have to<br>
>>have some level of learning all the time, and if you took all of the<br>
>>money we're spending on unemployment compensation and made that, in<br>
>>effect, "yes, we'll give you unemployment compensation, and by the way,<br>
>>while you're unemployed, learn something so you're more employable," we<br>
>>would have substantially in the last 10 years increased the intellectual<br>
>>capital base of the society.  Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
>>the ultimate cost to the consumer, if that were made as part of the cost<br>
>>of an ultimate product or service, is very significant.  When people<br>
>>start thinking that the employee is paying, no.  The consumer's paying<br>
>>that.<br><br>

>>Furthermore, the cost to the human being.  I mean, I felt terrible for<br>
>>this man.  We had sent him a signal as a society to do nothing with his<br>
>>life, to waste his life for four years.  And he was terrified.  And yet<br>
>>-- common sense cues off the culture.  I mean, if the culture says, "why<br>
>>are you being stupid?  "this is your time to go on vacation," and again,<br>
>>I have relatives out of heavy industry areas who felt it was unpatriotic<br>
>>to go back to work early.  "I've got 13 more weeks left, and deer<br>
>>season's about to open.  "why would I go back to work now? " This is not<br>
>>apocryphal.  I personally have relatives who have done that.<br><br>

>>but that obviously -- that obviously won't work.  I mean --<br><br>

>> it did work.<br><br>

>>You don't have --<br><br>

>>it worked for 70 years.<br><br>

>>But it didn't work because we're in the decay that we're in right now, so<br>
>>obviously --<br><br>

>>no, but it worked for the individual.<br><br>

>>It's not competitive --<br><br>

>>huh?<br><br>

>>It wasn't competitive collectively.  I mean --<br><br>

>>that's right.  As a society, it's not competitive.  Even if it's okay for<br>
>>an individual and for an individual to carry to the extreme of the guy in<br>
>>villa Rica, it's disastrous.<br><br>

>>but when we're forced to face the Japanese model, we lose.<br>

>> well, but we're in a more competitive world.  So I'm trying -one of the<br>
>>strategic things we're trying to do is find every opportunity to use<br>
>>resources more intensely.  So if we pay you for unemployment, we also get<br>
>>you trained.  It's a constant matrix so that every time we get a chance,<br>
>>we're doing two or three things at once with the same resource, because<br>
>>you can't compete in the world market if you're sloppy with either your<br>
>>human or your financial or your physical resources.  You've got to have<br>
>>all of them working together if you're going to keep up with China and<br>
>>Japan and Germany.<br>
<br>
Now, let me also suggest to you that this is why you have to replace
welfare with a work requirement.  That you absolutely have to establish the
assertion that work is the preeminent -- is a preeminent American
characteristic, and that we expect people to work, period.  If you're
able-bodied, if you're under the age of retirement, you should work.  And
that goes back to Jamestown, 1607.
<P>
Now, we also should be -- if we're going to compete in the world market, we
should eliminate jobs -- government policies that kill jobs.  And one I
want to focus on for a minute, because it's so fascinating, is create a
common sense legal system through liability reform.  Edwards Deming picked
on litigation as one of the two major impediments to American
competitiveness in the world market, and "U. S.  News" last year put
together, I thought, a very interesting list.  What they did is they took a
product you buy, they showed you the retail price, they then showed you the
cost to retailer -- or the cost that it would be without the cost of
insurance and litigation.
<P>
Just look at these, because they're fascinating.  Eight-foot aluminum
ladder.  Retail price, $119.  True cost, 95.  Litigation tax, $24.  On a
$119 ladder.  Heart pacemaker, $18,000 retail.  True cost, 15,000.
Litigation tax, 3,000.  Two-day maternity stay.  Retail price, 3,367.  True
cost, 2,867.  Litigation tax, $500.  Tonsillectomy, retail price, 578.
True cost, 387.  Litigation tax, 191.  In that case, it's almost one-third
of the total.  Motorized wheelchair, $1,000.  And these are all "U. S.
News'" numbers.  True cost, 830.  Litigation tax, 170.
<P>
>>one-third is going to litigation?
<P>
>>For manufactured goods and for health-related goods.  It's higher in<br>
>>those areas.  But it's -- there's a significant distortion in the system,<br>
>>I mean.  And you can tell this when you turn on the TV in the afternoon,<br>
>>and what do you see?  You see a lawyer who says, you know, "if you<br>
>>haven't sued somebody recently, why don't you bring your rolodex down to<br>
>>the office and let's go through it together? " I mean, just listen -- if<br>
>>you're thinking about a competitive world versus a self-destructive,<br>
>>decaying welfare state, just think of the psychology of a society which<br>
>>bombards itself all day with messages, "have you sued somebody recently?<br>
>>"<br>
<br>
>>I've got a more --
<br><br>
>>okay.
<br><br>
>>Equally amazing.  A medical helicopter, about $40,000 a month.  My insurance is $16,000 a month.

>>So your medical helicopter, getting the -- not counting whatever the<br>
>>litigation cost is, the product liability cost of buying the helicopter,<br>
>>you're actually paying 40,000 for the helicopter and 16,000 for your<br>
>>insurance.  And this is for a helicopter which is built to go save lives.<br>
>><br>
<br>
>>and we have a perfect safety record for 18 years, so --<br><br>

>>this is why they bury you rather than treat you.<br><br>

>>I'm not getting into that.  But anyway.  Does that -- does that framework<br>
>>make some sense now, to give you a sense of -- and again, it's not that<br>
>>you shouldn't have litigation when appropriate.  It's not that you don't<br>
>>want to have the right to sue when it's absurd, but where is the<br>
>>standard?  How -- what -- what percent should the society pay to sustain<br>
>>the right to sue?  And because nobody's saying, "don't pay anything," but<br>
>>is there a point where you reach relative justice at rational cost, or<br>
>>you maximize the opportunity to sue but then pay such a large cost that<br>
>>you're actually diverting resources out of competing with Germany and<br>
>>Japan and China into fighting yourself?  And that's the sort of question<br>
>>you've got to ask about that kind of reform.  You've also got to reform<br>
>>red tape.<br><br>

I got an interesting letter from Christopher Mcintyre in Woodville, Ohio.
He says, "I'm a 29- year-old" -- he takes the course, I think, on Mind
Extension University.  He says, "I'm a 29-year-old entrepreneur.  "I own a
small heating business in an area in northwest Ohio.  "the business will be
three full years old in April.  "it's gone from absolutely zero dollars to
projected sales of $400,000 in 1995.  "it now has four employees, and we
pride ourselves in our teamwork, for we understand it is united we stand
and divided we fall.  "I am now going to list the government agencies which
keep my business on the edge of existence, absorb 54% of the 1993 gross
profit, and hamper our progress through needless paperwork." He then lists
20 agencies.  He says, "1, internal revenue.  "2, social security tax.  "3,
federal income tax.  "4, state income tax.  "5, local municipal tax.  "6,
bureau of employment services.  "7, auditor of state.  "8, auditor of
county.  "9, treasurer of state.  "10, bureau of workers' compensation.
"11, state tax collected.  "12, state unemployment tax.  "13, federal
unemployment tax.  "14, excise tax in communications.  "15, sales tax.
"16, gasoline tax.  "17, permit fees.  "18, license fees.  "19, insurance
bonds.  "and, 20, paying an accountant $40 an hour to figure out the taxes.
"one problem I have is when no one collects unemployment or uses the
workers' compensation fund for a period of three years, why don't we get a
percentage of that back? " See?
<P>
Now, this guy -- I mean, this is just one of the letters we get.  We get, I
guess, 30 to 100 letters every week, and this one's from Christopher
Mcintyre in Woodville, Ohio.  But it gives you the sense of, here you are,
you're a small business, you're an entrepreneur, you're out there for the
first time, and as soon as you open the door, here comes the government.
And so you have to work your way past the government to be able to get to
work.
<P>
And it's a very interesting -- how many of you have run a small business?
Can you all -- a good number of you.  Can you all identify with his --
okay.  But you have to ask yourself.  I mean, this is not an act of nature.
Governments are creations of free will.  So if it's a dumb thing to do, we
do have the option of not doing it.  I mean, this is radical.  You have the
option of redesigning it so as not to be dumb.  Okay?  It's a very
important part of what we're trying to do here, is say -- one of the
lessons of American Civilization is to stop being dumb.  That's what
pragmatism based -- I mean, if you think about it, I mean, just think about
the word "pragmatism." Pragmatism, in a very real sense, was a philosophy
that said, "try not to be dumb."
<P>
I mean, when you -- you know, and you used to see it in the old movies
where you'd have the cowboy and you have the English duke who'd arrive, and
the English duke would be wearing all these fancy European clothing and
carrying all these books and doing all these European things, and the
cowboy would sort of say, "you know, probably riding across the desert in
Arizona.  "it's just as well not to do those things." And, of course, the
Englishman will say, "well, of course we have to do these things.  "after
all, that's how we aristocrats are." And the cowboy or the Indian scout or
whatever would then say, "well, of course you can do those things, but this
is not going to be good." And, of course, the whole rest of the movie would
be gradually the guy learning how to dress like an American, act like an
American, et cetera, so by the end of the movie, when the Englishman who
had now been Americanized got back to England, people were going, "why are
you doing that? "
<P>
Now, true pragmatism would recognize that it is fine to wear wool in
Scotland and not as smart to wear it in the Arizona desert, so that, in
fact, there's no right.  I mean, the right thing in the Arizona desert is
the wrong thing in Scotland.  I'm not arguing that the deer slayer would do
better from "the Last of the Mohicans" if we sent him to Scotland.  What
I'm arguing is that American pragmatism basically started with the idea, do
what works.  Don't do what's dumb.  I mean, and again, this is so basic
that it often sounds -- I feel like, I mean, I almost ought to remind you,
you know, that I have a Ph. D. .  And I'm Speaker of the House.  I'm not
just making these things up so that they sound odd.  But you now have a
high culture, an elite culture, which is so nutty that to wander in and
say, "why don't we quit doing the dumb ones," and people go, "well, you
can't do that." But of course you can do that.  That's what a free society
is all about.  It's about the right to adapt and change.
<P>
>>it's in the declaration.
<P>
>>Yeah, it's in the declaration -- where is it in the declaration?  What<br>
>>does it say?<br>
<br>
>>"That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,<br>
>>it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a<br>
>>new government having its foundations on such principles and<br>
>>organizations, its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely<br>
>>to effect their safety and happiness."<br>
<br>
>>so, in other words, the Founding Fathers would think it was all right to<br>
>>quit being dumb.  See?  I know this -- but I'm trying to -- okay.  I'm<br>
>>just trying to lay out here in very simple English what is really a very<br>
>>radical thought.  When you run into something which is destructive, stop<br>
>>doing it.  If you applied that across -- Drucker had a way of saying it.<br>
>>He said -- he said -- he said, at least once a year, walk through<br>
>>everything you're doing and ask the question, would you start it?  And if<br>
>>the answer's no, why are you still doing it?  And you apply that test, it<br>
>>is amazing how much stuff you'd change.<br>
<P>
Now, we also want to, frankly, in the current setting, cut the size of
government.  On every government dollar, we should ask, is it more
productive than the same dollar spent in the private sector?  It's a very
important challenge.  Because in an entrepreneurial society, the question
is, who is more likely to create the next 1,000 jobs?  Norman Brinker, or a
department of labor bureaucrat?  Very important question.  Because guess
where the welfare state would tend to spend the money.  They would tax
Brinker and his investors to transfer the money to the bureaucrat in the
department of labor.  Or the Department of Commerce.  I'm not trying to
pick on one department.  I'm trying to give you a model.  So you want to
shrink the size of government to maximize the resources available to
entrepreneurial behavior.
<P>
Which is why limited government, low taxes, balanced budgets, and stable
money -- what I think I'd call honest money -- are the core lessons of
Smith, Hayek, Schumpeter, and Friedman.  That all of them argued again and
again for the last 220 years that you want government to be very limited,
not to be weak.  To do very well the limited things it does.  You want low
taxes, so most resources stay with entrepreneurs.  You want balanced
budgets, because you want to force priorities and force decisions to keep
the government limited.  And finally, you want money to be stable, or I
would describe it as honest money.
<P>
That is, if the government gives you a dollar and you save that dollar,
then 10 years from now, you should be able to cash that dollar in and it
should still be a dollar.  Very key idea in the Constitution.  The
Constitution's a very anti-inflationary document, which is why they
literally wrote in you can't repudiate the debt, you have to pay the
interest on the debt, because they were very determined to minimize
inflation.  Remember that money is both the medium of exchange -- I give
you a dollar, you give me a goodie -- and it's a store of value.  I give
you a dollar, you want it to still be a dollar.
<P>
And so the idea in the theoretical model was you had very limited
government, you had balanced budgets, you kept most resources in the
private sector, and most of those resources could be stored in a currency
which would not lose value, and that was the core model of the
entrepreneurial system under Alexander Hamilton and others.  And for the
government that does remain, which will still be, frankly, pretty big, you
want to apply quality to turn Second Wave bureaucracies into Third Wave
citizen-oriented service organizations.  That is, again and again, you want
to say to people, how can we re-create customer behavior in the bureaucracy
so that instead of bureaucrats seeing you as trapped, they see you as a
customer to be served?  And how do you get the kind of speed and
effectiveness in government that you would normally expect in a private
sector?
<P>
One example of that is you want to reshape our foreign service so that it
helps Americans create local jobs through world sales.  You want to -- we
for 50 years focused our foreign service on defeating the soviet empire.
It's gone.  I think we now want to say, all right, how do we compete across
the planet?  What do we do in order to be able to make sure that Americans
are selling everywhere?  You also want to draw distinction between what
government does and what government makes happen.  This was the essence of
Hamilton's policies.
<P>
The thing we can say -- we want something -- building the transcontinental
railroads.  One way to have built the transcontinental railroads would have
been to set up the federal department of transcontinental railroads and
have the Corps of Engineers build it.  We did that with the Panama canal,
which was so big a project and so unusual that we actually had the corps of
engineers build the Panama canal.  But for the transcontinental railroads,
what we said was, "we'll give you land and we'll give you cash if you'll
build the railroad." So you had a lot of entrepreneurs rushing around
trying to build railroads for about a 35-year period.
<P>
We wanted air travel around the world.  So we had -- we subsidized Pan Am.
Much of the early rise of the domestic airlines industry was paid for by
airmail, which subsidized their routes.
<P>
So there are a lot of ways that government can shape things.  We can change
tax laws to shape behavior.  You can say, "we want more scientists, so if
you can score above 1300 in math and science, we'll give you an automatic
four-year scholarship to the school of your choice, and if you'll continue
to major in math and science, we'll guarantee you a graduate fellowship,"
and you'd see a shift.  You'd see people responding to the incentives.
That's different than government doing it directly.  We want to encourage
people to buy homes, so we give you a mortgage deduction on your house.
The result is people have a propensity to buy homes, and people do - how
many of you have thought about tax consequences when you think about your
home mortgage?
<P>
All right.  So a government can shape activities and not just do them.
Government actually has three very different roles in the economy.  It has
police powers.  For example, we insist onfood being healthy.  It can
reshape markets.  We can encourage and discourage behavior, and we can
operate directly through the bureaucracy.
<P>
They're very different ways of doing things.  Police power is when we say,
we won't tolerate water that would poison you.  We won't tolerate food
being sold that will poison you.  It's literally the government interfering
and saying, this is a matter of criminality, this is a matter of law, and
we'll use the state to enforce it directly.  Second, we can shape the
markets.  So we have tax deductions.  For example, if you have a very long
tax deduction which may be perfect for a steel mill and you're in the age
of software and it depreciates every 18 months, your depreciation rate
which is perfect for a steel mill is five times as long as the software.
And so you may literally want to rethink your tax code as you go into that.
<P>

Third, you have bureaucratic decisions.  We're going to have a brand new
program, five bureaucrats will get together and they'll pass out the
goodies.  That, in my judgment, is the least effective and the most
politicized way for a government to function.  And is the one we should
avoid as often as possible.  Which is why I would suggest we want to
replace bureaucratic government controls with achievement oriented systems.
<P>

And the three examples I'd give you are the occupational safety and health
act, or health agency, the environmental protection agency, and the food
and drug administration.  In each case, I mean, one way to get safety is to
hire somebody who becomes a bureaucrat who visits your plant and has a
cookbook, and they check off whether or not you're doing what the
regulations say.  Another way is to say, "if you have no accidents at your
plant, we'll lower your taxes.  "if you have a lot of accidents at your
plant, we're going to dramatically raise your taxes." People would then
have a tremendous incentive to avoid accidents.  And they would apply their
human ingenuity to make sure that it was safe.
<P>
And I'm just trying to give you that as a way of thinking about a very --
one approach is to say, we will hire somebody, they'll come inspect you.
Now, the way we got to this -- did we talk in here one day about speed
limits?
<P><pre>
>>yes.

>>Just go back to the speed limit model, because that was really for us the
>>great breakthrough.  That we Americans routinely look at a speed limit
>>and add five or 10 miles an hour to the posted number.  Which means when
>>you have an Osha regulator walk in, your initial instinct is to resent
>>them for being there, and then it is to figure out not "how do I get to
>>safety," but "how do I get around the rules? " And so you become
>>rule-focused rather than safety-focused.

>>A few weeks ago when Frederico Pena announced that in the light of the
>>recent poor period for airline safety that they were going -- there was a
>>new policy whereby -- wherein the aim would be zero accidents, I had two
>>questions.  One was, what was the policy before?  Ten accidents, five?
>>And the second question was, what was the incentive?  There was no
>>incentive.  It was just a blanket announcement that we're going to go for
>>zero accidents.  Did we talk -- did you and I talk about that?

>>no.  But remember, what did we do when we did the red bead experiment?

>>Tried for zero.

>>Tried for zero.  And how did we communicate that to the workers?  There
>>you go.  You see, he still has it.  There's his "I'm a quality worker" --
>>remember?

>>I still have my "quality worker" sticker.

>>see?  You know, once the union steward, always the union steward.  It's a
>>-- and he's ready.  But do you see the model?  That if all you're doing
>>is exhorting, "let's not have any accidents," what does that mean?  Of
>>course, we're not -- let me tell you, I fly often enough, I always think,
>>I hope the mechanic did a good job.  I hope the pilot's really excited
>>about this.  I hope they put the right kind of fuel in the tank.  You
>>know, I hope that the air traffic control system's doing right, and I
>>hope the next airport's not fogged in.  I mean, I'm big on this idea you
>>ought to get down the same way you got up, which is in one piece.  Huh?

>>That's the way I like it.

>>Right.  But the idea that the way you get to that is you set incentives,
>>you encourage the right behavior, you go through Deming's sense of a
>>quality system, it's so totally different than having the next bureaucrat
>>show up.  And, in fact, if you look at the best of the federal aviation
>>administration, it's cooperative, it's not adversarial.  It's just --
>>because the pilots, after all, have an equally big incentive.

>>They're always the first ones to arrive at the scene of the accident.

>>That's right.

>>My father's a pilot, and he said that mothers will come up to him and
>>say, you know, "be careful, my son's on the plane." And then he'll tell
>>them, "well, you know, my mother's son's on the plane too."

>>Yeah.  I mean, if you think about it -- and that's one of the reasons why
>>aviation works so interestingly, because everybody has a vested interest
>>in safety.  And so what you want is you don't want an adversarial role,
>>what do I have to hide from?  How are they going to try to regulate me?
>>You want a team effort, where everybody gets in the same room and says,
>>"let's swap notes honestly and let's find the right way to do this." It's
>>very different than the government as adversary and regulatory
>>bureaucrat.
</pre>
We also ought to, frankly, reshape incentives to regain a one generation
lead in technological products.  The examples I just list here are
aircraft, space, biotechnology, materials technology, and computing.  We
should literally have as a national strategy, how do we create the tax
incentives and the other incentives so that we are consistently staying a
generation ahead of the rest of the country, I mean, of the rest of the
planet?  So that when you want to buy the best aircraft in the world, you
buy American.  When you want to buy the best computing or the best software
or whatever, you buy American.  And I think that's very, very important
conceptually.
<P>
Now, what I want to suggest to you, and this is what I've been working on
for a couple years that I'm trying to get into the national dialogue,
because it's so different than the way we normally think of it.  I believe
that health could be our biggest job creator and foreign exchange earner.
Don't think of -- and this goes back to the two models here for a second.
Do not think of health as problem.  Lost cost.  Lots of red tape.  Instead,
think of it over here as opportunity.
<P>
What if the best health on the planet were in America?  And everybody in
America who got seriously ill decided that they would come to Americans for
their health care, and the best products on the planet were American, and
therefore you consistently got diagnosed with American tools, you took
American medicines.  If you had a genetic defect, you used an American
system of gene therapy.  If you had a serious illness, you had an American
do the operation.  And they might do it by virtual reality 3,000 -- 12,000
miles away by satellite.
<P>
Now, what would happen to cash flow?  We would buy Chinese teddy bears.
They would buy open-heart surgery.  And so you could afford -- and you'd
have a huge assemblage in America of very high value-added people, so that
having the most specialists in the world wouldn't be a problem, it might
well be an opportunity.  Depends on how you -- you see, if you think of it
only inside the welfare state and you say, "wow, we have too many
specialists." How do you know?
<P>
One of the things you hear often in the welfare state model is, there are
too many cat scans.  Do you realize that there are more cat scans in
Washington state than there are in Canada?  People say that like it's a
problem.  There are also more microwaves.  There are also more cellular
telephones.  There are also more fax machines.  There are also more VCRs.
Why aren't the others a problem?  Why?  Because they're private and the
price crashes.  The only two places the price doesn't crash in the welfare
state, the only two places the technology does not crash in the welfare
state are defense and health.  These are the only two places the government
messes it up totally.  In fact, there's an article, it's the cover of this
week's "business week," on the fact that, you know, you now get cellular
phones as a give-away.  You know, what is it, order "time" magazine and
we'll send you a phone?  I want you to think about that, okay?  Why isn't
that happening in health technology?
<P><pre>
>>People are always going to be sick.

>>No, it's not simply -- people are always going to use the telephone.
>>Because over here, you have an open market in the entrepreneurial model
>>and everybody's out, you know, busting their tail to produce it cheaper
>>and better.  Over here, you have some bureaucracy taking seven years to
>>approve, and over here, you've got a bureaucrat paying for it.  Over
>>here, you have a customer paying for it.  So you want to rethink the
>>entire health system, but your goal should be to make American health and
>>American health care the finest value-added on the planet, because as
>>people get richer, they pay more for health care.  There is today a
>>Boeing 747 that fills up in Japan that flies to Minneapolis in order to
>>go shopping at the mall of the Americas.  Now, if you'll go to the mall
>>of the Americas from Tokyo in order to buy Reeboks, can you imagine what
>>you'll do for open-heart surgery or for a liver transplant?

>>Don't we already see that happening today, I would argue --

>> It's beginning to happen, but in the welfare state model, it happens
>>despite us, not because of us.  And what you want to do is accelerate it
>>and change the whole model from bureaucratic to -- so what I'm suggesting
>>is you want to think vision, strategies, projects, and tactics as it
>>relates to health.  And when you think you've got this aggressive model
>>locked in, you then want to go to doctors and you want to go to
>>pharmacies and you want to go to biotech people and you want to go other
>>places, and you want to go back to listen, learn, help, and lead, and you
>>want to share with people the concept of health within a renewed American
>>Civilization, both better health care at lower cost with greater health
>>for Americans, and the idea that health can lead to tremendous creativity
>>and to a very big market all around the world.
</pre><p>
Think of it this way, health is a Third Wave information revolution, which
means it should be an explosion of lower costs, higher quality, more
choices, and greater access.  That should be the model you want.  I mean,
entrepreneurship, all the things we talk about, if you look at the lessons
of American history, personal strength combined with entrepreneurial free
enterprise combined with the spirit of invention and discovery implemented
through Deming's model of quality should lead you to lower cost, higher
quality, more choices, and greater access, and yet in the welfare state
model, you can't even quite believe.  I mean, you say, "well, that's silly.
"nobody can get all those." That is the normal model, isn't it, in the
private sector?  That is what we expect.  And so you want to liberate
health from bureaucracy, reestablish this dynamic.  Now, we have a pretty
neat video that came out of Hewlett-Packard that I'm going to share with
you that gives you an example of the kind of dynamic Third Wave world
market health system we're thinking about.
<P><pre>
>>hi.  This is Tom Miller.

>>Tom, this is Hal.  You wanted a consult on your patient, Emily nelson.

>>Yeah, Hal.  Emily's labs show no infectious etiology, but her liver
>>function continues to deteriorate.

>>well, this berry picking, we can see a fairly high suspicion now for
>>mushroom poisoning.  Now, look at this.  I've asked the nurse to get an
>>ID.  From Emily on these if she can.

>>good.  I'll also order a screen for amatoxins.

>>a word of caution, tom, now, if this is amanita, liver failure can be
>>quick, and the mortality rate among kids is over 50%.

>>I'll be over to the hospital soon, Hal.  I want to thank you.

>>okay.  I'll keep current on her labs.

>>Good.

>>Emily, I've got some pictures of mushrooms that I'd like you to look at.  Do you think it could have been this one?

>>huh-uh.

>>No?  How about this one.

>>Uh-huh.

>>Are you sure?

>>Uh-huh.

>>Okay.

>>Emily's hepatotoxic, and the amanita did test positive.  I've notified
>>the CDC and the state health department.

>>how bad is she?

>>Not good.  The pet scan shows progressive liver damage.  In fact, I've
>>got her listed with the national registry for possible transplant.

>>When would she need it?

>>Soon.  However, here's something interesting.  Two amanita cases in
>>Oregon were treated with forced Diuresis and pulled through.  Of course,
>>Emily's going on 30 hours now, and I'm not sure she'll respond, but then
>>I found this from Jean Leclair in Geneva.  He's the leading expert on
>>toxin mycology, and he's trying a whole new protocol.

>>We should call him.

>>I did.

>>So having studied your patient's pet scan, I think she can be helped by a
>>procedure we have begun to use in Europe.  Here is an article on the
>>treatment protocols we have devised.  Though this is a new therapy, it
>>has proved quite effective in several cases already.

>>I went ahead and started Leclair's treatment.  I hope it works.  There's
>>no telling if we'll find a liver in time.

>>"softer, cleaner hand.  "he sat up and began to groom his whiskers,
>>always a good performance."

>>How's the little girl in 137?

>>Emily?  Her family's had a hard day.  But it looks like she's responding now.

>>Bile support system's working well.  Labs look good.  What's next?

>>A quiet night, I hope.

>>Hi, tom.  We just did a new liver function test on Emily nelson.  And
>>good news, I think we caught this thing in time.  She's doing so well, I
>>canceled her listing for a transplant.  I'll fill you in tomorrow.

>>Hi, sweetheart.

>>Hi, Mommy.

>>Now, I want to say three things very quickly out of this one film.  One,
>>you're going to move into a world where you have worldwide real-time
>>distance medicine.  And that means both job opportunities, it means
>>dramatically different health care costs, it means dramatically different
>>quality of care.  Two, by using this kind of a model, you can literally
>>be current in the smallest community in the world with the most advanced
>>technology wherever it is.  So that you're able to move into saying,
>>"this just happened.  "what do we need to do about your cancer? " And
>>know what the most current treatment is anywhere on the planet in real-
>>time.  Three, there's no reason only doctors have access to it.  I mean,
>>what this is going to mean is -- I have several friends now whose
>>children have problems, and the friends are on the Internet accessing
>>medical libraries.  Because they have a higher passion for solving the
>>problem.  Not that they know as much, but they're willing to focus on
>>getting their child's solution.
</pre>
So within a decade, I think you're going to start getting user friendly
medical systems that allow you to learn about your disease and your
protocol, and you to look at all the research being done everywhere on the
planet, and for you to access it from your home or from your hospital bed,
and it's a totally different model than the model we've had for the last 70
years, and it both creates tremendous revolutions in health care and it
creates an enormous opportunity for us, if we lead that revolution, to
provide the highest value care on the planet and to create the most high
value jobs.  And in that kind of world, you have Americans who don't worry
at all about China or Mexico or anywhere else.  We offer health care, they
offer other things.
<P>
Next week, our topic is going to be replacing the culture of violence and
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety, and we're going to look
at next week's reading, which is don Eberly's "building a community of
citizens," chapter 16.  And I strongly recommend you look at Marvin
Olasky's "the tragedy of American compassion" which I have with me and
which is a fabulous book.

<I><FONT SIZE ="+2">W</FONT>elcome</I> to the American Conservative Union's "Legislative Update" page.  On this page you will
find regular updates on the key legislation we are tracking, as the legislation moves from
introduction to subcommittee and committee hearings, subcommittee and committee markups,
and floor action in both the House and Senate.  On any given day, this is where you can get the
latest information available on the key issues conservatives care about.
<P>
As the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, founded more than three
decades ago, the ACU sees its proper role as being the grass-roots lobby for the entire
Conservative Movement.  As such, we are not a single-issue organization.  Our officers, staff, and
-- most importantly -- our members are motivated toward public policy activism by the shared
beliefs explained in the ACU Statement of Principles.
<P>
Because the ACU is a multi-issue, umbrella organization, we monitor and lobby on a wide range
of issues before the Congress.  For ease in tracking those various pieces of legislation, we have
broken them down into four general categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Economic and Budget issues (examples:  the Balanced Budget Amendment; the Tax
     Limitation Amendment; the Budget Resolution; tax legislation; health care reform
     legislation; legislation to raise the debt ceiling; the Mexico bailout; etc.)
<LI>Social and Cultural issues (examples:  the Crime Bill; welfare reform; a school prayer
     amendment; abortion legislation; homosexual rights legislation; educational choice; etc.)
<li>Foreign Policy and Defense issues (examples:  ballistic missile defenses; the United
Nations; Bosnia; Haiti; the foreign aid bill; the War Powers Act; etc.)
<LI>Institutional Reform issues (examples:  term limits; campaign finance reform; budget
     process reform; repeal of the 16th Amendment, which instituted the income tax; lobbying
     reform; etc.)

</UL>

<title>Hot Issues -- Travelgate -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2>Hot issues<p>Travelgate</h2><br><p></center>
The following letter, from ACU Chairman David A. Keene, was delivered to the United States Senate on September 11, 1996.
<p>
Dear Senator:<p>
On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge you to oppose the Levin-Biden amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill during floor considerations today.<p>
The Levin-Biden amendment would strike the provision providing for financial restitution for Billy Dale, the former head of the White House Travel Office, on the grounds that the measure is a private relief bill.
<p>
But that is not the case.  A private relief bill is legislation that, among other things, names a specific individual who will receive a benefit.  The Treasury-Postal bill contains no such specific reference.  The provision in question merely notes that its purpose is to provide restitution for the wrongly-fired former employees of the White House Travel Office.<p>
What's really going on here is that Senate liberals are trying to get Bill Clinton off the hook.  If they succeed in striking this provision, given the crush of legislative business remaining to be done in the few short weeks before the planned adjournment, Mr. Dale will have to wait until the next Congress to have his legal bills -- now in excess of $500,000 -- paid.  That's just not right.<p>
It wasn't right for Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Dale in the first place.  It wasn't right for Mr. Dale to be accused and indicted.  It wasn't right for the White House to look over his FBI file seven months <i>after</i> they had fired him.  It wasn't right that Mr. Clinton -- even after a jury acquitted Mr. Dale on all counts in less than two hours, after a two-week trial -- continued to remind the public that Mr. Dale had once considered agreeing to a guilty plea.<p>
And it's not right that Senators Levin and Biden want to protect the president from having to sign this provision into law.<p>
Billy Dale was an innocent man, unjustly accused, who watched his world crumble around him -- all for the sake of political spoils.  His reputation was besmirched, his family humiliated, his integrity challenged.  You can't repair the emotional damage the Clinton White House has inflicted on this man and his family.  But you can help him get one step closer to being financially whole again.  Defeat Levin-Biden, and return to Billy Dale at the very least the money that was taken from him.<p>
Yours Sincerely,<p>
David A. Keene<br>
Chairman<p>

                    The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 27, 1996:             <P>                  Dear Representative: <P>       On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 1833, the partial birth abortion ban, when it comes to the floor today for a        vote.      <P>          As you know, this bill passed the House last November, and then passed the Senate with slight        modifications.  By passing the Senate version of the legislation today, you will bypass the needfor        a conference committee and send the bill directly to the president's desk.      <P>          One Senate amendment allows the procedure in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the        mother.  And another Senate amendment shifts the burden of proof to prosecutors to demonstrate        that the abortionist had other options available to save the life of the mother (whereas the original        House language had placed the burden of proof on the abortionist to demonstrate that he or she        had no other option).                We believe the Senate amendments are acceptable, and do not deviate from the basic thrust of the        bill:  to prohibit the grisly practice of beginning the delivery of a baby, only to stop when the        baby's head is still inside the mother so as to facilitate killing it.         <P>       Surely a nation as civilized as ours believes itself to be will not tolerate this ghastly activity.                That the pro-abortion lobby has rallied so vociferously against this legislation -- even prompting a        veto threat from the White House -- reveals better than words just how deep is their commitment        to the abortion cause and industry, and shows who are the true "radical extremists" in this policy        debate.                <P>                      Yours sincerely,                          <P>                                    David A.

The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 28, 1996:                                     <P>                              Dear Representative:     <P>  On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 3103, the "Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996,"        during floor consideration today and tomorrow.      <P>          As you know, this bill is a combination of three separate bills -- HR 3103, HR 3070, and HR 995        -- that went through the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Economic Opportunities Committees,        respectively, and was melded together by the Rules Committee yesterday.  <P>              For three years now, as one of the largest grass-roots groups lobbying on the issue of health care        reform, we have held fast to a set of principles for dealing with health care reform.  They are:<P>                1)     Expanding coverage through portability, done on a group-to-group basis;      <P>  2)     Expanding coverage for individuals through encouraging states to create risk pools   for        persons with pre-existing medical conditions;     <P>      3)    Expanding coverage through the creation of Medical Savings Accounts;     <P>      4)     Reducing costs through the imposition of limits on medical malpractice lawsuits;       <P>    5)     Reducing costs through an increase in the deduction for self-employed workers.          <P>      HR 3103 deals with health insurance reform in a reasonable and limited fashion, in a manner        based on several of these principles.  The legislation would provide for portability of health        insurance coverage on a group-to-group basis; would increase the deduction for self-employed        individuals from 30 to 50 percent; would limit medical malpractice claims, a much-neededchange        that would make health insurance more affordable by lowering insurance premiums for healthcare        providers; would encourage, through tax policy, the creation of state-level high-risk pools; and        would authorize MSAs, a provision which conservatives have supported for years as the only        long-term solution of the health insurance problem.      <P>             We can tell you:  this legislation addresses the problems in the health care delivery system in a        limited, reasonable way, and should garner the support of all those wishing to correct somecurrent        inadequacies in the system without allowing for a government take-over of the industry.                     <P>                    Yours sincerely,                  <P>                       David A.

 The following letter was sent from ACU Chairman, David Keene, to the United States Senate on March 27, 1996:   <P>
                                                  Dear Senator:          <P>      On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to oppose the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment to raise the minimum wage.            <P>    Economists of all stripes agree that the minimum wage has but one guaranteed effect -- to make        job creation more difficult for those small businesses that are the engine of job growth inAmerica,        and to thereby make getting a job more difficult for those seeking entry-level positions.        <P>        Given that our economy has performed anemically over the last several years -- a direct result of        federal government policies which include burdensome regulations, high taxes, and wasteful        spending programs that take otherwise productive dollars out of the private economy and putthem        into unproductive dollars in the public sector economy -- this hardly seems the right time to be        considering raising the costs of offering a job to a prospective employee.      <P>          Could it be that there's something else going on here?  Perhaps a transparent political payoff toBig        Labor, whose bosses just this week endorsed Bill Clinton for reelection -- the earliest-ever        endorsement by the unions of a candidate for the office?  When you take that into consideration,        and add to it the fact that the AFL-CIO bosses also announced this week their plans to raise an        additional $35 million war chest to target 75 House Republicans (combined with their expected        $400 million in-kind donations to Democratic candidates in this fall's elections), one begins to see        a pattern emerging.      <P>          Don't fall for it.  The minimum wage is a job-killer.  At a time when we need to be creating more        new jobs, not less, don't make it more difficult for small businesses to do so.  Reject union boss        pressure and stay firmly on the side of those millions of workers looking for entry-level positions.     <P>                                 Yours sincerely,    <P>                                                          David A.

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
        Immigration Reform          </h2>            
       

                                 <BR>


        Wednesday, March 20, 1996:

        <P></center>


        

        On behalf of the more than one million members
and supporters of the American

        Conservative Union, I'm writing to share
our concerns regarding the controversial issue of

        worker verification hotlines as contained
in HR 2202, the immigration reform bill you will

        be considering today and tomorrow.  We oppose
such hotlines, and urge you to oppose them

        as well.  Specifically, I urge you to oppose
the Gallegly amendment, and to support the

        Chabot amendment instead.

   <P>     

        The original version of the bill contained
language mandating a national employment

        verification pilot program, through the institution
of an 800-number hotline attached to a

        database.  Critics rightfully referred to
this as a &quot;1-800-BIG BROTHER&quot; number.

<P>        

        The worker verification provisions in the
original bill have been diluted somewhat.  Instead

        of a mandatory national program, the underlying
legislation now calls for a &quot;voluntary&quot;

        program in which employers could call a national
database to verify whether or not

        prospective workers were eligible for employment.

<P>        

        But what is the point of establishing a pilot
program, on either a mandatory or voluntary

        basis, if not to test its efficacy?  If it
fails, it will have been merely a waste of time and

        money.  But if it succeeds, the likelihood
is great that a move would be made in a future

        Congress to mandate the program nationally
-- something we oppose outright.

<P>        

        To begin, we have a strong philosophical
objection to the entire concept that individuals and

        private employees must phone the Federal
Government to ask permission to work. 

        Moreover, we have serious concerns about
where this might lead.  Once a national

        employee verification hotline is established,
we're only one short step away from national

        identification cards, to &quot;ease&quot;
the burden on the hotline and further combat fraud.  (In fact,

        we've noted with some dismay the establishment
of just such a federal identification card in

        the original version of the companion Senate
legislation, S. 269.)

<P>        

        In addition to our pure philosophical objections,
there are also practical considerations.  As

        we read the legislation, it appears to us
that the heaviest burden likely would fall on those

        businesses that seek to abide by the law;
those who knowingly and regularly flout the law

        by hiring illegal aliens would be no more
likely to abide by this law than they would be

        likely to abide by current law.  Thus, just
as in the case of the Brady Bill (which merely

        mandates that law-abiding citizens must wait
to purchase a hand gun, while criminals are

        not deterred at all from purchasing such
weapons), it is the law-abiding citizens who pay the

        price.

<P>        

        Small businesses do not have the staff or
the resources to keep up with the new mandate. 

        Many would be literally snowed under with
the new requirement.  Those who survive the

        new regulatory burden may see their colleagues'
distress and conclude that disobeying the

        law is a cost of doing business -- thereby
taking law-abiding small business owners and

        turning them into criminals.  Is that what
we want?

        <P>

        The Gallegly amendment would re-institute
the mandatory nature of the verification pilot

        program, while the Chabot amendment would
eliminate the program altogether.  For that

        reason, we urge you to oppose the Gallegly
amendment, and support instead the Chabot

        amendment.  When even a president as liberal
as Bill Clinton says &quot;The era of Big

        Government is over,&quot; how can we justify
the creation of a Big Brother employment

        verification hotline -- even on a trial basis?

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Whitewater</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>

        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support an unlimited extension of the Special
        Whitewater Investigative Committee when the matter comes to the Senate floor this week.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that the Whitewater investigation has been going on for quite
        some time, it is also undeniably true that many in the Clinton White House and the
        Administration have displayed a callous, flagrant disregard for the subpoenas served on
        them.  On numerous occasions, documents subpoenaed months and even years ago have
        miraculously been &quot;discovered&quot; out of the blue.  Just in the past ten weeks, this has
        happened on four separate occasions, with the most recent &quot;discovery&quot; coming just a few
        days ago, when the White House released Counsel Bruce Lindsey's notes of a meeting
        long past.<p>
        
        No rational person could observe this pattern developing and not question whether or not
        the White House was complying fully with the Senate investigation, as the President
        promised it would.  Instead, it looks as if the White House has something to hide, and that
        someone there believes that if they just hold out long enough, the Senate committee will
        run out of time and money, and the danger -- whatever it might be -- will have passed.
        
        For that reason, we urge you to support not only an extension of the Whitewater
        Committee, but an indefinite extension.  Putting a time limit on it -- as some Democratic
        Senate leaders have suggested -- would merely tell anyone continuing to hold back
        documents how much longer they had to hide them before the threat was passed.<p>
        
        The American people want this investigation concluded, but they also want it concluded
        with no doubts left as to the facts of the matter.  Otherwise, the time and money spent
        already would be a waste.<p>
       
<Pre>
                          Yours sincerely,
        
        
               

                          David A. Keene
                              Chairman
